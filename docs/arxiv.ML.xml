Summary:
Visual question answering has been a challenging task requiring deep learning models to process information from both vision and language domains. This project focused on visual question answering on plots and proposed BERT-VQA, an architecture based on VisualBERT with a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder. The model was compared against a baseline consisting of LSTM, CNN, and a shallow classifier, revealing that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT may not be essential for aligning plot components with question phrases. The study provided insights into the complexities of plot question answering and the suitability of different model architectures for solving this task. Overall, the findings contribute to understanding the challenges of visual question answering and the role of model design in addressing specific subtasks.

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this problem.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management. Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately, our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing, leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data. The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines. Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social media data into informative and noninformative categories across various natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and 5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis management solutions.

<div> Keywords: Physics-informed neural networks, differential equations, training point distribution, shallow network architectures, solution accuracy

Summary:<br>
Physics-informed neural networks are being explored as a method to approximate differential equations by incorporating their structure and conditions in a loss function, making them versatile for modeling invariants. The approach, considered mesh-free, can compute solutions on arbitrary grids post-training. This study systematically examines the impact of training point distributions on solution accuracy for ordinary and partial differential equations with different training data generation strategies and network architectures. Various parameter combinations and distributions, including novel sine-based training points inspired by Chebyshev nodes, are tested for reproducibility. Results suggest a strong link between training point distributions and the characteristics of the differential equation, highlighting the importance of carefully choosing the distribution for optimal performance. <div>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks approach the approximation of differential equations by directly incorporating their structure and given conditions in a loss function. This enables conditions like, e.g., invariants to be easily added during the modelling phase. In addition, the approach can be considered as mesh free and can be utilised to compute solutions on arbitrary grids after the training phase. Therefore, physics-informed neural networks are emerging as a promising alternative to solving differential equations with methods from numerical mathematics. However, their performance highly depends on a large variety of factors. In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a core component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test two ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for training data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two hidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based training points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes. The results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g., random and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility. The results show the impact of the training point distributions on the solution accuracy and we find evidence that they are connected to the characteristics of the differential equation.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new model, Deep Graph Neural Point Process (DGNPP), for learning temporal interaction networks (TIN) that takes into account the network topology structure influence. DGNPP comprises two key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer focuses on the topological structures to generate static representations for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically updates embeddings over time. By integrating both dynamic and static embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing via maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP effectively predicts events and occurrence times. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate superior performance of DGNPP in event prediction and time prediction tasks, outperforming baseline models and addressing the limitations of previous approaches. DGNPP showcases high efficiency and effectiveness in learning TINs. <div>

Abstract: Learning temporal interaction networks(TIN) is previously regarded as a coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problem, ignoring the network topology structure influence. This paper addresses this limitation and a Deep Graph Neural Point Process(DGNPP) model for TIN is proposed. DGNPP consists of two key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer and the Self Attentive Layer. The Node Aggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static representation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically updates embeddings over time. By incorporating both dynamic and static embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing the model via maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP predicts events and occurrence time effectively. Experimental evaluations on three public datasets demonstrate that DGNPP achieves superior performance in event prediction and time prediction tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models and effectively mitigating the limitations of prior approaches.

Summary: 
RISE introduces a two-stage framework to enhance Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by addressing the limitations of standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT). In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven approach generates logically consistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) to improve reasoning abilities. The framework then leverages a subset of high-quality CoTs in the Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) for supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning, resulting in enhanced interpretability and accuracy in complex visual tasks. RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and improved explainability. This approach offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without the need for manually annotated CoTs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks, such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training. We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations, achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring manually annotated CoTs.

Summary: 

This article introduces a novel methodology for identifying and feedback linearizing a physical system based on prior dynamic behavior. The approach involves using a sparse regression algorithm to identify the system and then designing a feedback controller by applying Lie derivatives to eliminate internal dynamics. By combining stacked regression algorithms and relative degree conditions, the proposed method aims to discover and feedback linearize the true governing equations of a physical model. This innovative approach offers a promising strategy for tackling the challenging task of understanding and controlling complex physical systems. <div>

Abstract: Discovering the governing equations of a physical system and designing an effective feedback controller remains one of the most challenging and intensive areas of ongoing research. This task demands a deep understanding of the system behavior, including the nonlinear factors that influence its dynamics. In this article, we propose a novel methodology for identifying a feedback linearized physical system based on known prior dynamic behavior. Initially, the system is identified using a sparse regression algorithm, subsequently a feedback controller is designed for the discovered system by applying Lie derivatives to the dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint which guarantees that no internal dynamics are observed. Unlike the prior related works, the novel aspect of this article combines the approach of stacked regression algorithm and relative degree conditions to discover and feedback linearize the true governing equations of a physical model.

Summary: 
Physics simulation-based Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) is proposed for sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to address the lack of labeled data. PPDA uses realistic human body movement data to simulate various variability factors and improve training datasets. Compared to traditional Signal Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA), PPDA consistently enhances model performance by up to 13 pp, achieving competitive results with fewer training subjects. The study demonstrates the benefits of PPDA in enhancing HAR models and highlights the potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement Unit data. This cost-effective and scalable approach effectively tackles the challenge of limited annotation in HAR. <div>
arXiv:2508.13284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially resulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the activity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation. PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose estimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and hardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional STDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First, we evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to their STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can reduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects used for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs. As the first systematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR, these results highlight the advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement Unit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in HAR.

<div> Algorithmic matching, data-driven, human-AI complementarity, healthcare, social services<br>
<br>Summary:
The article introduces a collaborative approach, "comatch," aimed at achieving human-AI complementarity in algorithmic matching systems. Comatch defers some decisions to human decision makers based on confidence levels, optimizing overall performance. A human subject study with 800 participants validates the effectiveness of comatch, showing improved matching outcomes compared to human-only or algorithm-only decisions. The study data and system implementation are available as open source. The proposed approach addresses the limitation of existing systems by optimizing decision-making collaboration between humans and algorithms. <div>
arXiv:2508.13285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision makers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes application domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However, existing systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity: decisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not necessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our work aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching (comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative approach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task like existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most confident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process, comatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the human decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale human subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch outperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic matching on their own. The data gathered in our human subject study and an implementation of our system are available as open source at https://github.com/Networks-Learning/human-AI-complementarity-matching.

<div> Hierarchical Conformal Classification, Uncertainty Quantification, Machine Learning, Semantic Relationships, Class Hierarchies
<br>
Summary:
Hierarchical conformal classification (HCC) is introduced as an extension of conformal prediction (CP) to incorporate class hierarchies in prediction sets. HCC optimizes for prediction sets that maintain coverage guarantees while leveraging class hierarchies for structured and semantically meaningful predictions. By formulating HCC as a constrained optimization problem, prediction sets can consist of nodes at different hierarchy levels, enhancing interpretability and domain knowledge integration. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of HCC on audio, image, and text data benchmarks and shows that annotators prefer hierarchical prediction sets over flat ones, highlighting the practical benefits of incorporating class hierarchies in conformal prediction frameworks. The approach addresses the combinatorial nature of the problem by identifying a smaller subset of candidate solutions that ensure coverage and optimality. <br> <br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of prediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose solutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the hierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial nature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding optimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat prediction sets.

Summary:
The article discusses generating samples using Flow Matching with additional constraints. It addresses two scenarios: a) when a differentiable distance function to the constraint set is given and b) when the constraint set is available via a membership oracle. For case (a), a modified FM objective penalizing distance from the constraint set is proposed. For case (b), a mean flow approach using randomization is suggested to satisfy constraints. The two-stage approach proves computationally efficient, with the second stage probing constraints via randomization. Synthetic cases demonstrate significant gains in constraint satisfaction while maintaining target distributions. The approach is applied to training an adversarial example generator using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. Future research directions are highlighted, and code for the proposed approaches is available for reference. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of generating samples via Flow Matching (FM) with an additional requirement that the generated samples must satisfy given constraints. We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable distance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint set is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we propose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that penalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples. For case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is numerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This approach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex constraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to constrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show that a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow but with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is more computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained generation, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve significant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target distributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show how our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator, using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. We conclude with several future research directions. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhengyanHuan/FM-RE.

Summary:
This paper explores the challenge of machine language acquisition in a setting where the learner does not have full access to the relevant information, known as partial observability. The traditional approach of imitation learning is extended to address this issue, where the learner needs to infer information from the environment, actions taken, and messages received. The paper presents motivating examples and demonstrates a learning-based algorithm to decode private information to facilitate language acquisition. By relaxing the assumption of full observability, the study highlights the complexities and challenges that arise in decoding information in a more general setting. The proposed approach offers a solution to the problem of partial observability in machine language acquisition, providing insights into how language learning can be improved in scenarios where complete information is not available. <br><br>Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of machine language acquisition in a setting of partial observability, where the learner must infer information from the environment and actions taken.

arXiv:2508.13326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby posing a more challenging setting where such information needs to be inferred from knowledge of the environment, the actions taken, and messages sent. We see several motivating examples of this problem, demonstrate how they can be solved in a toy setting, and formally explore challenges that arise in more general settings. A learning-based algorithm is then presented to perform the decoding of private information to facilitate language acquisition.

Summary:
The study introduces a new framework for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis using dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention mechanisms. The approach dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, allowing the model to focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing time-varying graphs processed with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and transformers, the model captures localized interactions and global temporal dependencies. In evaluation on the ABIDE dataset subset, the model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, surpassing static graph-based approaches. The novelty lies in attention-driven dynamic graph creation for learning temporal brain region interactions and hierarchical spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCN-transformer fusion.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.

Summary: <br>
The paper introduces X-MoE, a novel MoE training system designed to enhance scalable training performance for expert-specialized MoE architectures like DeepSeek. X-MoE addresses limitations in current systems by implementing efficient padding-free training with cross-platform kernels, bypassing dispatch redundancy, and employing hybrid parallelism with sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Evaluation on the AMD MI250X GPU-powered Frontier supercomputer demonstrates X-MoE's ability to scale DeepSeek-style MoEs up to 545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs. This scalability is 10 times larger than existing methods within the same hardware budget while maintaining high training throughput. The X-MoE source code is publicly available on GitHub for further exploration and use. <br> <div>

Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication. Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs - perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for next-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel techniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer, powered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to 545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable model with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining high training throughput. The source code of X-MoE is available at https://github.com/Supercomputing-System-AI-Lab/X-MoE.

Summary: 
This note introduces a linear algebraic method for proving dimension lower bounds in linear methods solving $L^2$ function approximation problems. The approach, previously discussed in Barron (1993) for Kolmogorov $n$-widths, is utilized to establish sample size lower bounds in kernel methods. This method provides a new perspective on determining the minimum sample size required for accurate function approximation in linear models. By applying linear algebra techniques, the paper shows the fundamental relationship between the dimensionality of the space and the accuracy of function approximation in various linear methods. This insight can guide the design and evaluation of linear models in practical applications, shedding light on the importance of considering dimensionality in the analysis of function approximation problems. <div>

Abstract: Predicting counterfactual distributions in complex dynamical systems is essential for scientific modeling and decision-making in domains such as public health and medicine. However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations, synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and distributional accuracy.

Summary: <br>
The article introduces a unified framework based on conformal prediction to transform sampled trajectories into calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. These trajectories are commonly used in various domains such as autonomous driving and epidemic modeling but are typically uncalibrated. The proposed method includes an online update step and an optimization step to produce discontinuous prediction intervals around each trajectory, capturing temporal dependencies and providing sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates. By utilizing this framework, practitioners can generate ensemble paths with calibrated prediction intervals, offering a more reliable way to account for inherent uncertainty in future trajectories. <div>

Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.

Summary: 
The article presents a unified framework for collaborative inference systems on resource-constrained edge devices. It addresses the need for concurrent execution of diverse tasks in real-world applications like autonomous driving and augmented reality. The proposed framework, J3O, jointly decides which multi-task models to deploy and how to route queries to maximize overall inference accuracy. J3O formulates this as a mixed-integer program and utilizes an alternating algorithm for model selection and optimal offloading. The framework also considers batching at the edge to maintain scalability under varying task loads. Experimental results demonstrate that J3O consistently achieves high accuracy levels while significantly reducing runtime compared to the optimal solver. Overall, the framework offers a promising solution for efficient and accurate inference on edge devices in multi-task scenarios. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent services on resource-constrained edge devices has spurred the development of collaborative inference systems that distribute workloads across end devices, edge servers, and the cloud. While most existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios, many real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality) require concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection, segmentation, and depth estimation. In this work, we propose a unified framework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at clients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy (offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and communication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and introduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed submodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained linear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge, maintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O consistently achieves over $97\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less than $15\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task benchmarks.

Summary:
This study introduces a quantitative framework for evaluating the agreement between seizure onset zones (SOZs) and statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of chirp events. The pipeline includes Unsupervised Outlier Detection using Local Outlier Factor analysis and Spatial Correlation Analysis. The LOF approach effectively detects outliers, with weighted index similarity performing better than exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics were highest in seizure-free and successful surgical outcome cases, while lower in failure cases.

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative framework for evaluating the spatial concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones (SOZs) and statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of chirp events. The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1) Unsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with adaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on spectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and temporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that the LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects outliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1) were highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those with successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas failure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The key takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted spatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization, particularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.

<br><br>Summary: Designing de-novo molecules efficiently requires exploring a vast chemical space. Mol-LLMs based on string representations have emerged as scalable options for exploring billions of molecules. Standard language modeling practices greatly impact molecular generation performance. The NovoMolGen models, pretrained on 1.5 billion molecules, achieve state-of-the-art results in unconstrained and goal-directed molecular generation tasks. However, a weak correlation exists between pretraining performance metrics and actual downstream performance, underscoring differences in training dynamics between molecular and general NLP tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.13408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$ possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations, Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules. However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies, model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5 billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.

Summary: <br>
The paper introduces two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, for contextual linear bandits over networks. These algorithms allow for adaptive information sharing in networked environments with shared structural similarities and local differences. By decomposing learning into global and local components, the algorithms enable agents to benefit from shared structure without full synchronization, resulting in reduced learning complexity from O(N) to sublinear O(√N). NetLinUCB is effective in low-noise regimes with fine-grained heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust in high-dimensional, high-variance contexts. The algorithms incur lighter communication costs compared to fully centralized settings as agents share computed summaries regarding homogeneous features. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks. <div>

Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper, we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

MAVIS, a Multi-Objective Alignment via Value-Guided Inference-Time Search framework, enables dynamic control over Large Language Models (LLMs) without modifying model weights. It trains small value models for different objectives and allows users to adjust LLM output distribution using specified weights. The value models are trained iteratively to improve the KL-regularized policy. Empirical results show MAVIS outperforms methods that fine-tune per-objective models and post hoc combination, approaching performance of ideal fine-tuning for user preferences. This lightweight framework addresses the challenge of balancing multiple objectives in LLM applications, providing flexibility and efficiency in aligning model outputs with user-specific preferences. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives -- such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.

Summary:
- Time series forecasting is crucial in domains like energy and transportation.
- Incorporating natural language-based events into forecasting enhances performance.
- Existing approaches often rely on a single modality, limiting contextual knowledge.
- Event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF) addresses synchronization, temporal uncertainty, and misalignment challenges.
- EventTSF integrates historical time series with textual events using autoregressive diffusion with flow matching, adapting flow matching timesteps based on event semantics, and employing a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate EventTSF outperforms 12 baselines in event-aware non-stationary forecasting, achieving higher accuracy and faster training efficiency.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality, resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF), an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions. Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.

Summary:<br>
The paper introduces SVDformer, a novel framework for learning representations on directed graphs that addresses the limitations of existing models. By combining SVD and Transformer architecture, SVDformer enhances directional semantics and global structural patterns in directed graphs. It refines singular value embeddings through multi-head self-attention to filter out noise and model multi-scale interactions using Transformer to preserve edge directionality. Experimental results on six benchmarks show that SVDformer outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and direction-aware baselines in node classification tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in learning representations for directed graphs. <div>
arXiv:2508.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) has democratized the design of machine learning based systems, by automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering. However, the high computational cost associated with traditional search and optimization strategies, such as Random Search, Particle Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization, remains a significant challenge. Moreover, AutoML systems typically explore a large search space, which can lead to overfitting. This paper introduces a metalearning method for dynamically designing search spaces for AutoML system. The proposed method uses historical metaknowledge to select promising regions of the search space, accelerating the optimization process. According to experiments conducted for this study, the proposed method can reduce runtime by 89\% in Random Search and search space by (1.8/13 preprocessor and 4.3/16 classifier), without compromising significant predictive performance. Moreover, the proposed method showed competitive performance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn, reducing its search space. Furthermore, this study encompasses insights into meta-feature selection, meta-model explainability, and the trade-offs inherent in search space reduction strategies.

Abstract: In real-world applications, machine learning models face online label shift, where label distributions change over time. Effective adaptation requires careful learning rate selection: too low slows adaptation and too high causes instability. We propose ASAP (Adaptive Shift Aware Post-training), which dynamically adjusts the learning rate by computing the cosine distance between current and previous unlabeled outputs and mapping it within a bounded range. ASAP requires no labels, model ensembles, or past inputs, using only the previous softmax output for fast, lightweight adaptation.

<div> Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification, Prototype Contrastive Learning, Adaptive Task-Weighting, Semantic Consistency, Loss-Weighting Mechanism<br>
Summary:<br>
The article introduces HCAL, a hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC) classifier that addresses challenges in maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting. HCAL integrates prototype contrastive learning and adaptive task-weighting mechanisms to improve semantic consistency by explicitly modeling labels and feature aggregation from child to parent classes. It also includes an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that dynamically allocates optimization resources based on task-specific convergence rates, reducing optimization bias. A prototype perturbation mechanism injects controlled noise to enhance robustness and expand decision boundaries. The proposed quantitative metric, Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR), evaluates hierarchical consistency and generalization. Experimental results across three datasets demonstrate higher classification accuracy and reduced hierarchical violation rates compared to baseline models. <br> <div>

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes. The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak" optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline models.

Random Forest and k-NN classifiers performed best, achieving high accuracy in detecting optimal cases. Feature influence sensitivity maps using SHAP explanations revealed the importance of specific chirp attributes in clustering and class separation within the embedding space.

Abstract: This study presents a pipeline leveraging t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for interpretable visualizations of chirp features across diverse outcome scenarios. The dataset, comprising chirp-based temporal, spectral, and frequency metrics. Using t-SNE, local neighborhood relationships were preserved while addressing the crowding problem through Student t-distribution-based similarity optimization. Three classification tasks were formulated on the 2D t-SNE embeddings: (1) distinguishing clinical success from failure/no-resection, (2) separating high-difficulty from low-difficulty cases, and (3) identifying optimal cases, defined as successful outcomes with minimal clinical difficulty. Four classifiers, namely, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors, were trained and evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across tasks, the Random Forest and k-NN classifiers demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to 88.8% accuracy in optimal case detection (successful outcomes with minimal clinical difficulty). Additionally, feature influence sensitivity maps were generated using SHAP explanations applied to model predicting t-SNE coordinates, revealing spatially localized feature importance within the embedding space. These maps highlighted how specific chirp attributes drive regional clustering and class separation, offering insights into the latent structure of the data. The integrated framework showcases the potential of interpretable embeddings and local feature attribution for clinical stratification and decision support.

Summary:<br>
The paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework for approximating nonlinear dynamical systems governed by PDEs.

Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up to 86.7\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel, computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.

Summary:<br>
The article discusses the opaqueness of complex machine learning algorithms and its ethical implications. It distinguishes between opaqueness arising from technical complexity in algorithms such as artificial neural networks and intentional hiding of workings for proprietary reasons in commercial systems. The authors explore explanatory methods developed in computer science to overcome technical opaqueness in AI, highlighting the challenges faced by explainable AI (XAI) in providing transparency. The analysis underscores the importance of addressing the dual nature of opaqueness in AI and developing effective strategies for making algorithms more transparent and accountable to their stakeholders.<br>
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The opaqueness of many complex machine learning algorithms is often mentioned as one of the main obstacles to the ethical development of artificial intelligence (AI). But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly complex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes of data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes, rendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being, including their designers and developers; they are "black boxes" for all their stakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical complexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from view for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision systems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness. In the first part of the chapter, we will examine these two ways of understanding opacity and the ethical implications that stem from each of them. In the second part, we explore the different explanatory methods that have been developed in computer science to overcome an AI system's technical opaqueness. As the analysis shows, explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges.

MuFlex addresses the limitations of existing building-sector testbeds by providing a scalable platform that enables synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres to the latest OpenAI Gym interface for standardized RL implementation. The platform's capabilities were demonstrated in a case study involving four office buildings, where the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm was utilized to coordinate demand flexibility and reduce total peak demand while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

arXiv:2508.13532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid, maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance. Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

Summary:
CALYPSO is a new hybrid modeling framework that combines neural networks and mechanistic metapopulation models to forecast the spread of MRSA in healthcare and community settings. By integrating patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare transfer patterns, CALYPSO can accurately predict MRSA rates at various spatial levels and analyze the impact of infection control strategies. This model outperforms traditional machine learning approaches in forecasting MRSA infections and can identify regions at high risk for outbreaks. CALYPSO also supports counterfactual analyses to assess different infection prevention policies and resource allocation strategies, making it a valuable tool for public health officials and policymakers. The framework provides both interpretability and performance, improving forecasting accuracy by over 4.5% and offering insights into cost-effective intervention strategies.<br><br>Summary: CALYPSO is a hybrid modeling framework that integrates neural networks and mechanistic metapopulation models to forecast MRSA spread, using diverse datasets to improve accuracy and support public health decision-making. <div>
arXiv:2508.13548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a critical public health threat within hospitals as well as long-term care facilities. Better understanding of MRSA risks, evaluation of interventions and forecasting MRSA rates are important public health problems. Existing forecasting models rely on statistical or neural network approaches, which lack epidemiological interpretability, and have limited performance. Mechanistic epidemic models are difficult to calibrate and limited in incorporating diverse datasets. We present CALYPSO, a hybrid framework that integrates neural networks with mechanistic metapopulation models to capture the spread dynamics of infectious diseases (i.e., MRSA) across healthcare and community settings. Our model leverages patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters governing MRSA spread. This enables accurate, interpretable forecasts at multiple spatial resolutions (county, healthcare facility, region, state) and supports counterfactual analyses of infection control policies and outbreak risks. We also show that CALYPSO improves statewide forecasting performance by over 4.5% compared to machine learning baselines, while also identifying high-risk regions and cost-effective strategies for allocating infection prevention resources.

Summary:
- Risk prediction using genetic findings is crucial for public health improvement.
- Existing tests lack accuracy due to focus on common genetic loci only.
- Future research should consider both common and rare variants for better prediction.
- The CROC approach combines common and rare variants for improved accuracy.
- Evaluation using data from Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 showed CROC outperforming FROC method in scenarios with fewer common variants. 
<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risk prediction that capitalizes on emerging genetic findings holds great promise for improving public health and clinical care. However, recent risk prediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common genetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome have not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are proposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk prediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an extension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional procedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the use of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on common variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two approaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis. We found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when the number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario, when there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of 0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.

Summary:
The US CDC has identified MRSA as a serious antimicrobial resistance threat, particularly for hospitalized patients. A novel generative probabilistic model, GenHAI, has been developed to model sequences of MRSA test results during hospital stays. The model, based on probabilistic programming, can address important questions for hospital administrators aiming to mitigate MRSA infection risks. It enables the approximation of predictive, causal, and counterfactual queries. Comparing GenHAI with discriminative and generative machine learning models using real-world data sets showed its efficacy. The unique factors contributing to the high risk of MRSA acquisition in hospitals, such as co-morbidities, immunosuppression, and antibiotic use, make it crucial to implement effective strategies to prevent infection transmission through contaminated surfaces and healthcare workers. <div>

Abstract: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2019, designated Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a serious antimicrobial resistance threat. The risk of acquiring MRSA and suffering life-threatening consequences due to it remains especially high for hospitalized patients due to a unique combination of factors, including: co-morbid conditions, immuno suppression, antibiotic use, and risk of contact with contaminated hospital workers and equipment. In this paper, we present a novel generative probabilistic model, GenHAI, for modeling sequences of MRSA test results outcomes for patients during a single hospitalization. This model can be used to answer many important questions from the perspectives of hospital administrators for mitigating the risk of MRSA infections. Our model is based on the probabilistic programming paradigm, and can be used to approximately answer a variety of predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model by comparing it against discriminative and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.

They show how existing SSCL methods like BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV can be unified under GLF with different constraining parts. The authors propose two key insights for designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. To address the challenge of designing a constraining part without labels, they introduce a method called Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC), which captures the dynamic relationships between anchor and other samples to induce intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation prove the effectiveness of ADC in improving SSCL performance. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has recently demonstrated superiority in multiple downstream tasks. In this paper, we generalize the standard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of two parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three existing SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be unified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further propose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class information of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is challenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To address this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and inter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship between anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or far from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further away from the anchor point in the feature space. Both the theoretical analysis and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.

<div> bounded algorithms, causal inference, partial identification, practical guidance, machine learning

Summary:<br>
The thesis focuses on comparing different bounding algorithms for causal inference, considering the limitations of traditional causal assumptions. Instead of relying on strong assumptions, partial identification provides bounds that reflect uncertainty in the data. State-of-the-art methods, including symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches, are evaluated across various causal scenarios. An extension of an entropy-bounded method allows for counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency. The study includes simulations on discrete and continuous data processes, evaluating bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to assumption violations. A practical decision tree for algorithm selection is proposed, and a machine learning model predicts the best-performing method based on data characteristics. The implementations are available in the open-source Python package CausalBoundingEngine for easy application and comparison of bounding methods. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice. Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied work, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of practical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically comparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal scenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a common evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a recently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving both discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method in terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to assumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a practical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data characteristics.
  All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package, CausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods through a unified interface.

<div> Keyword: Large models, Federated Learning, Knowledge distillation, Resource heterogeneity, Communication overhead

Summary: 
FedOL proposes a novel approach for decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared model in mobile networks. It addresses challenges of resource heterogeneity and communication overhead by using knowledge distillation instead of parameter sharing. By exchanging model prediction outputs on a public dataset, FedOL reduces communication demands and enables customization of model architectures. The specialized objective function in FedOL helps mitigate biases in client predictions due to skewed data distributions. The iterative refinement of pseudo-labels and server model enhances learning reliability. FedOL also incorporates a tailored pseudo-label generation strategy to integrate diverse knowledge effectively. Simulation results demonstrate that FedOL outperforms existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks where clients have limited computational resources but possess valuable private data. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients, and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational resources.

Summary: 
Neural network weight generation has shown promise but struggles with generalization to unseen tasks and practical applications. To address this challenge, the authors propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates task-specific weights conditioned on natural language descriptions. T2W processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates text embeddings from CLIP through a prior attention mechanism, and utilizes adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to improve generalization. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate T2W's ability to produce high-quality weights for unseen tasks, surpassing optimization-based initialization methods. Moreover, T2W enables weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion, bridging textual semantics with weight-space dynamics. The authors provide an open-source dataset of text-weight pairs and share their code on Github, advancing the practicality of generative models in neural network parameter synthesis.

Abstract: How far are we really from automatically generating neural networks? While neural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle with generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To address this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates task-specific weights conditioned on natural language descriptions. T2W hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates text embeddings from CLIP via a prior attention mechanism, and employs adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to enhance generalization. Experiments on Cifar100, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet demonstrate T2W's ability to produce high-quality weights for unseen tasks, outperforming optimization-based initialization and enabling novel applications such as weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion. Our work bridges textual semantics with weight-space dynamics, supported by an open-source dataset of text-weight pairs, advancing the practicality of generative models in neural network parameter synthesis. Our code is available on Github.

<div> Keywords: machine learning, stochastic gradient descent, learning rate adjustment, automatic procedure, second-order algorithms

Summary:
This article introduces a new approach to automatically adjusting the learning rate in modern machine learning using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The proposed method leverages stochastic second-order algorithms to update the learning rate based on the variation of stochastic gradients. Unlike existing techniques that require manual tuning of hyperparameters, this approach simplifies the process by automatically increasing or decreasing the learning rate based on the norm of stochastic gradients. The resulting learning rate regime demonstrates efficiency, robustness, and scalability across various stochastic algorithms like SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD in machine learning tasks. This new method eliminates the need for complex parameter tuning and reduces computational expenditure, time, and power consumption, making it a practical and effective approach for improving the performance of machine learning models. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD), whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated automatically only according to the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients. An explainable LR regime by leveraging stochastic second-order algorithms is developed, behaving a similar pattern to heuristic algorithms but implemented simply without any parameter tuning requirement, where it is of an automatic procedure that LR should increase (decrease) as the norm of stochastic gradients decreases (increases). The resulting LR regime shows its efficiency, robustness, and scalability in different classical stochastic algorithms, containing SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD, on machine learning tasks.

Summary: <br>
The article discusses the challenges of subgraph federated learning with distributed graph-structured data and proposes FedSheafHN, a novel framework. FedSheafHN uses a sheaf collaboration mechanism to enhance client descriptors and generate personalized models efficiently. It embeds local subgraphs into a collaboration graph, enriches client representations via sheaf diffusion, and utilizes a hypernetwork for model generation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing methods on various graph datasets, showing faster model convergence and effective generalization to new clients. This framework addresses the issue of performance variation across clients in personalized subgraph FL and provides a promising solution for handling diverse data distributions in federated learning settings. <br> <div>

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many applications. In subgraph federated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a local subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for each client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance variation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local subgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework built on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors with efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by leveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the collaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN generates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it exhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients.

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-rank subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches, GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.

Summary:
This study introduces a new scaling paradigm, Input Time Scaling, focusing on refining inputs during training and testing by leveraging meta-knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs). The research uncovers a training-testing co-design phenomenon where query strategies are essential during both phases, not just one. Surprisingly, seemingly low-quality datasets can yield high performance, challenging the belief that "garbage in, garbage out" holds true. It was also found that models trained on more data with similar quality may perform worse, underscoring the need for careful inspection of dataset size scaling. The Less is More phenomenon is supported, suggesting that a small set of examples can evoke high-level reasoning abilities. Experimental results on the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on specific tasks, with potential further improvements through a majority vote ensemble approach. Open-sourcing datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints will be pursued to facilitate reproducibility and future research endeavors. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.13654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out". Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

Summary: 
This paper introduces an extended framework called PS-PFN that combines Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) with adapting modern ML pipelines. The traditional AutoML systems focus on hyperparameter optimization, but with the evolution of pre-trained models, the need for fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques has become crucial. PS-PFN leverages Posterior Sampling to efficiently explore and exploit adapting ML pipelines by using prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value through in-context learning. The method is extended to account for varying costs of pulling arms and to model reward distributions individually per arm. Experimental results on benchmark tasks show that PS-PFN outperforms other bandit and AutoML strategies. The code and data are available on GitHub at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus. <div>

Abstract: Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) has been fundamental to traditional AutoML systems. However, with the advancements of pre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization and often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques. While the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a downstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands novel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and adapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit adapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed bandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via in-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying costs of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions individually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing standard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies. We make our code and data available at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus.

Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents. Experimental results on the SMAC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several maps.

<div> bandits, heavy-tailed, linear, FTRL, adversarial  
<br>  
Summary:  
This article introduces a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed bandit problems, focusing on both stochastic and adversarial regimes. A novel algorithm, Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW), is proposed for heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits (MABs) that achieves low regret in both regimes. The framework is extended to heavy-tailed linear bandits with finite arm sets, matching the best-known regret bound in stochastic regimes. A data-dependent learning rate, Heavy-Tailed Noise Aware Stability-Penalty Matching (HT-SPM), is introduced to ensure BOBW regret bounds for heavy-tailed bandit problems. The algorithm utilizes a variance-reduced linear loss estimator to improve performance, achieving the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear bandits. The approach addresses the challenges of heavy-tailed distributions in bandit problems and provides efficient learning strategies for both stochastic and adversarial scenarios.  
 <div>
arXiv:2508.13679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy-tailed bandits have been extensively studied since the seminal work of \citet{Bubeck2012BanditsWH}. In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits, enabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed noises, have recently attracted significant attention \citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}. However, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few exceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits (MABs) \citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.
  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed bandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the loss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus function, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm for heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity assumption and achieves an $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ worst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\widetilde{O}(\log T)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework to the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed linear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an $\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the best-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose a general data-dependent learning rate, termed \textit{heavy-tailed noise aware stability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW regret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions are satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear loss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear bandits.

Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight, duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model selection process and providing insights into why the chosen model is the best fit.

Summary:
The article introduces a new method called DREAMS, which combines the local structure preservation of t-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA through a simple regularization term. This allows for the generation of a spectrum of embeddings that effectively balance both local and global structure preservation. The method is benchmarked across seven real-world datasets, showcasing its superior ability to preserve structure across multiple scales compared to existing approaches. DREAMS demonstrates enhanced performance in visualizing high-dimensional data in two dimensions by efficiently balancing both local and global structure preservation, making it a promising tool for researchers working with complex datasets in fields such as single-cell transcriptomics and population genetics. <div>

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically designed to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS, PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure preservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a simple regularization term. Our approach generates a spectrum of embeddings between the locally well-structured $t$-SNE embedding and the globally well-structured PCA embedding, efficiently balancing both local and global structure preservation. We benchmark DREAMS across seven real-world datasets, including five from single-cell transcriptomics and one from population genetics, showcasing qualitatively and quantitatively its superior ability to preserve structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.

arXiv:2508.13749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of sequential decision-making for Sharpe ratio (SR) maximization in a stochastic bandit setting. We focus on the Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm, a Bayesian approach celebrated for its empirical performance and exploration efficiency, under the assumption of Gaussian rewards with unknown parameters. Unlike conventional bandit objectives focusing on maximizing cumulative reward, Sharpe ratio optimization instead introduces an inherent tradeoff between achieving high returns and controlling risk, demanding careful exploration of both mean and variance. Our theoretical contributions include a novel regret decomposition specifically designed for the Sharpe ratio, highlighting the role of information acquisition about the reward distribution in driving learning efficiency. Then, we establish fundamental performance limits for the proposed algorithm \texttt{SRTS} in terms of an upper bound on regret. We also derive the matching lower bound and show the order-optimality. Our results show that Thompson Sampling achieves logarithmic regret over time, with distribution-dependent factors capturing the difficulty of distinguishing arms based on risk-adjusted performance. Empirical simulations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing algorithms.

<title>Depth-Breadth Synergy in RLVR: Unlocking LLM Reasoning Gains with Adaptive Exploration</title>

arXiv:2508.13755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions: Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance. Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the reasoning power of RLVR.

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and Transformer-based models.

Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of federated learning.

Abstract: This work presents a proof-of-concept implementation of a distributed, in-network reinforcement learning (IN-RL) framework for adaptive path selection in programmable networks. By combining Stochastic Learning Automata (SLA) with real-time telemetry data collected via In-Band Network Telemetry (INT), the proposed system enables local, data-driven forwarding decisions that adapt dynamically to congestion conditions. The system is evaluated on a Mininet-based testbed using P4-programmable BMv2 switches, demonstrating how our SLA-based mechanism converges to effective path selections and adapts to shifting network conditions at line rate.

<title>Assessing Trustworthiness of AI Training Dataset using Subjective Logic -- A Use Case on Bias</title>

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly rely on training data, assessing dataset trustworthiness has become critical, particularly for properties like fairness or bias that emerge at the dataset level. Prior work has used Subjective Logic to assess trustworthiness of individual data, but not to evaluate trustworthiness properties that emerge only at the level of the dataset as a whole. This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the trustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations of global properties such as bias. Built on Subjective Logic, our approach supports trust propositions and quantifies uncertainty in scenarios where evidence is incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting. We instantiate this framework on the trustworthiness property of bias, and we experimentally evaluate it based on a traffic sign recognition dataset. The results demonstrate that our method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable and robust in both centralized and federated contexts.

Abstract: Imbalanced distribution learning is a common and significant challenge in predictive modeling, often reducing the performance of standard algorithms. Although various approaches address this issue, most are tailored to classification problems, with a limited focus on regression. This paper introduces a novel method to improve learning on tabular data within the Imbalanced Regression (IR) framework, which is a critical problem. We propose using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to model and define a latent representation of data distributions. However, VAEs can be inefficient with imbalanced data like other standard approaches. To address this, we develop an innovative data generation method that combines a disentangled VAE with a Smoothed Bootstrap applied in the latent space. We evaluate the efficiency of this method through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark datasets for IR.

<title>One Shot vs. Iterative: Rethinking Pruning Strategies for Model Compression</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13836</link>

Abstract: Pruning is a core technique for compressing neural networks to improve computational efficiency. This process is typically approached in two ways: one-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and iterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for potentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has historically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather than rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and comprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions, benchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying different pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has specific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning ratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on these findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid approach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios, providing valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy tailored to their goals and constraints.

<title>FedUP: Efficient Pruning-based Federated Unlearning for Model Poisoning Attacks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13853</link>

arXiv:2508.13853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can be vulnerable to attacks, such as model poisoning, where adversaries send malicious local weights to compromise the global model. Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining. However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative, applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP achieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving storage compared to the SOTA.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience, highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.

<title>Fisher-Orthogonal Projection Methods for Natural Gradient Descent with Large Batches</title>

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory, enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global minimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high damping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively washes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage, reducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper, we introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that restores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster convergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the Fisher-metric.

<title>Revisiting Diffusion Q-Learning: From Iterative Denoising to One-Step Action Generation</title>

Abstract: The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning (RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time compared to DQL.

<title>Automated Energy-Aware Time-Series Model Deployment on Embedded FPGAs for Resilient Combined Sewer Overflow Management</title>

Abstract: Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution. Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE 0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general, our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub Repository (https://github.com/tianheng-ling/EdgeOverflowForecast).

<title>Categorical Policies: Multimodal Policy Learning and Exploration in Continuous Control</title>

Abstract: A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone, limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.

Abstract: Tabular data, consisting of rows and columns, is omnipresent across various machine learning applications. Each column represents a feature, and features can be combined or transformed to create new, more informative features. Such feature engineering is essential to achieve peak performance in machine learning. Since manual feature engineering is expensive and time-consuming, a substantial effort has been put into automating it. Yet, existing automated feature engineering (AutoFE) methods have never been investigated regarding their usability for practitioners. Thus, we investigated 53 AutoFE methods. We found that these methods are, in general, hard to use, lack documentation, and have no active communities. Furthermore, no method allows users to set time and memory constraints, which we see as a necessity for usable automation. Our survey highlights the need for future work on usable, well-engineered AutoFE methods.

arXiv:2508.13979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent multi-task learning studies suggest that linear scalarization, when using well-chosen fixed task weights, can achieve comparable to or even better performance than complex multi-task optimization (MTO) methods. It remains unclear why certain weights yield optimal performance and how to determine these weights without relying on exhaustive hyperparameter search. This paper establishes a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO methods, revealing through extensive experiments that well-performing scalarization weights exhibit specific trends in key MTO metrics, such as high gradient magnitude similarity. Building on this insight, we introduce AutoScale, a simple yet effective two-phase framework that uses these MTO metrics to guide weight selection for linear scalarization, without expensive weight search. AutoScale consistently shows superior performance with high efficiency across diverse datasets including a new large-scale benchmark.

Abstract: We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new combinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items simultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key structural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure, (ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii) heterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and prove that it achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$ episodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the fact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a second algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning (AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e., user scaling, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate our theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.

Abstract: We introduce the Knob-Meter-Rule (KMR) framework, a unified formalism for representing and reasoning about model efficiency techniques in deep learning. By abstracting diverse methods, including pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and parameter-efficient architectures, into a consistent set of controllable knobs, deterministic rules, and measurable meters, KMR provides a mathematically precise and modular perspective on efficiency optimization. The framework enables systematic composition of multiple techniques, flexible policy-driven application, and iterative budgeted optimization through the Budgeted-KMR algorithm. We demonstrate how well-known efficiency methods can be instantiated as KMR triples and present concise algorithmic templates for each. The framework highlights underlying relationships between methods, facilitates hybrid pipelines, and lays the foundation for future research in automated policy learning, dynamic adaptation, and theoretical analysis of cost-quality trade-offs. Overall, KMR offers both a conceptual and practical tool for unifying and advancing model efficiency research.

Abstract: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels, where rounding in each layer reduces capacity as bit-width shrinks; the floating-point (FP) checkpoint sets the maximum input rate. We track capacity dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator (STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via distillation) stabilizes training. Despite its simplicity, the method attains competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the efficiency of STE.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function. Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers.

Abstract: A datatset $X$ on $R^2$ is a finite topological space. Current research of a dataset focuses on statistical methods and the algebraic topological method \cite{carlsson}. In \cite{hu}, the concept of typed topological space was introduced and showed to have the potential for studying finite topological spaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology perspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets are assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using open sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types and its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate the inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space, in which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components. Those components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer sequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be well represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree). Such structures provide a platform for new algorithms for problems such as calculating convex hull, holes, clustering and anomaly detection.

Abstract: Due to regulations like the Right to be Forgotten, there is growing demand for removing training data and its influence from models. Since full retraining is costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this paper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning algorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive structure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning by estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant computational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this end, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to approximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of first-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically, we use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data removal. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives dominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without constructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning baselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning quality. Our code is released at https://github.com/NKUShaw/ZOWFKGIF.

Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a central tool in simulation-based chemistry. However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs struggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when trained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based chemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by construction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to ensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To address this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic Potentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian framework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of Variational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and minimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference time, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing architectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry tasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs, and trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy out-of-distribution regimes. Moreover, fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP yields consistent performance gains and calibrated uncertainties.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale. We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational partial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable. Based on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a broad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn reward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited amount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use LEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a single one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.

Abstract: AI hardware design is advancing rapidly, driven by the promise of design automation to make chip development faster, more efficient, and more accessible to a wide range of users. Amongst automation tools, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating and streamlining parts of the design process. However, their potential is hindered by data privacy concerns and the lack of domain-specific training. To address this, we introduce FedChip, a Federated fine-tuning approach that enables multiple Chip design parties to collaboratively enhance a shared LLM dedicated for automated hardware design generation while protecting proprietary data. FedChip enables parties to train the model on proprietary local data and improve the shared LLM's performance. To exemplify FedChip's deployment, we create and release APTPU-Gen, a dataset of 30k design variations spanning various performance metric values such as power, performance, and area (PPA). To encourage the LLM to generate designs that achieve a balance across multiple quality metrics, we propose a new design evaluation metric, Chip@k, which statistically evaluates the quality of generated designs against predefined acceptance criteria. Experimental results show that FedChip improves design quality by more than 77% over high-end LLMs while maintaining data privacy

Abstract: In particular, large-scale deep learning and artificial intelligence model training uses a lot of computational power and energy, so it poses serious sustainability issues. The fast rise in model complexity has resulted in exponential increases in energy consumption, increasing the demand for techniques maximizing computational efficiency and lowering environmental impact. This work explores environmentally driven performance optimization methods especially intended for advanced GPU architectures from NVIDIA, AMD, and other emerging GPU architectures. Our main focus is on investigating hardware-software co-design techniques meant to significantly increase memory-level and kernel-level operations, so improving performance-per-watt measures. Our thorough research encompasses evaluations of specialized tensor and matrix cores, advanced memory optimization methods, and creative integration approaches that taken together result in notable energy efficiency increases. We also discuss important software-level optimizations that augment hardware capability including mixed-precision arithmetic, advanced energy-aware scheduling algorithms, and compiler-driven kernel enhancements. Moreover, we methodically point out important research gaps and suggest future directions necessary to create really sustainable artificial intelligence systems. This paper emphasizes how major increases in training efficiency can be obtained by co-design of hardware and software, so lowering the environmental impact of artificial intelligence without compromising performance. To back up our analysis, we use real-world case studies from top companies like Meta, Google, Amazon, and others that show how these sustainable AI training methods are used in the real world.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that leverages 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (3D pCASL) MRI to compute sex-specific vascular scores that quantify cerebrovascular health and potential disease susceptibility. The brain is parcellated into spatially contiguous regions of homogeneous perfusion using supervoxel clustering, capturing both microvascular and macrovascular contributions. Mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) values are extracted from 186 cognitively healthy participants and used to train a custom convolutional neural network, achieving 95 percent accuracy in sex classification. This highlights robust, sex-specific perfusion patterns across the brain. Additionally, regional CBF variations and age-related effects are systematically evaluated within male and female cohorts. The proposed vascular risk-scoring framework enhances understanding of normative brain perfusion and aging, and may facilitate early detection and personalized interventions for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data, is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery, systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote reproducibility and community engagement.

<title>Search-Time Data Contamination</title>

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks: Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our experiments.

Abstract: Classification of scientific abstracts is useful for strategic activities but challenging to automate because the sparse text provides few contextual clues. Metadata associated with the scientific publication can be used to improve performance but still often requires a semi-supervised setting. Moreover, such schemes may generate labels that lack distinction -- namely, they overlap and thus do not uniquely define the abstract. In contrast, experts label and sort these texts with ease. Here we describe an application of a process we call artificial intuition to replicate the expert's approach, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate metadata. We use publicly available abstracts from the United States National Science Foundation to create a set of labels, and then we test this on a set of abstracts from the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation to examine funding trends. We demonstrate the feasibility of this method for research portfolio management, technology scouting, and other strategic activities.

Indeed, modern AI alignment tools such as Reward Modelling and Direct Preference Optimization are based on the statistical assumptions posed by the Plackett-Luce model. In this paper, I will connect the Plackett-Luce model to another classical and well known statistical model, the Cox Proportional Hazards model and attempt to shed some light on the implications of the connection therein.

Abstract: Understanding the complex and stochastic nature of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) remains a central challenge in systems biology. Existing modeling paradigms often struggle to effectively capture the intricate, multi-factor regulatory logic and to rigorously manage the dual uncertainties of network structure and kinetic parameters. In response, this work introduces the Probabilistic Categorical GRN(PC-GRN) framework. It is a novel theoretical approach founded on the synergistic integration of three core methodologies. Firstly, category theory provides a formal language for the modularity and composition of regulatory pathways. Secondly, Bayesian Typed Petri Nets (BTPNs) serve as an interpretable,mechanistic substrate for modeling stochastic cellular processes, with kinetic parameters themselves represented as probability distributions. The central innovation of PC-GRN is its end-to-end generative Bayesian inference engine, which learns a full posterior distribution over BTPN models (P (G, {\Theta}|D)) directly from data. This is achieved by the novel interplay of a GFlowNet, which learns a policy to sample network topologies, and a HyperNetwork, which performs amortized inference to predict their corresponding parameter distributions. The resulting framework provides a mathematically rigorous, biologically interpretable, and uncertainty-aware representation of GRNs, advancing predictive modeling and systems-level analysis.

Abstract: Curriculum analytics (CA) studies curriculum structure and student data to ensure the quality of educational programs. An essential aspect is studying course properties, which involves assigning each course a representative difficulty value. This is critical for several aspects of CA, such as quality control (e.g., monitoring variations over time), course comparisons (e.g., articulation), and course recommendation (e.g., advising). Measuring course difficulty requires careful consideration of multiple factors: First, when difficulty measures are sensitive to the performance level of enrolled students, it can bias interpretations by overlooking student diversity. By assessing difficulty independently of enrolled students' performances, we can reduce the risk of bias and enable fair, representative assessments of difficulty. Second, from a measurement theoretic perspective, the measurement must be reliable and valid to provide a robust basis for subsequent analyses. Third, difficulty measures should account for covariates, such as the characteristics of individual students within a diverse populations (e.g., transfer status). In recent years, various notions of difficulty have been proposed. This paper provides the first comprehensive review and comparison of existing approaches for assessing course difficulty based on grade point averages and latent trait modeling. It further offers a hands-on tutorial on model selection, assumption checking, and practical CA applications. These applications include monitoring course difficulty over time and detecting courses with disparate outcomes between distinct groups of students (e.g., dropouts vs. graduates), ultimately aiming to promote high-quality, fair, and equitable learning experiences. To support further research and application, we provide an open-source software package and artificial datasets, facilitating reproducibility and adoption.

Abstract: This article presents a modern deterministic framework for the study of leading significant digit distributions in numerical data. Rather than relying on traditional probabilistic or mixture-based explanations, we demonstrate that the observed frequencies of leading digits are determined by the underlying arithmetic, algorithmic, and structural properties of the data-generating process. Our approach centers on a shift-invariant functional equation, whose general solution is given by explicit affine-plus-periodic formulas. This structural formulation explains the diversity of digit distributions encountered in both empirical and mathematical datasets, including cases with pronounced deviations from logarithmic or scale-invariant profiles.
  We systematically analyze digit distributions in finite and infinite datasets, address deterministic sequences such as prime numbers and recurrence relations, and highlight the emergence of block-structured and fractal features. The article provides critical examination of probabilistic models, explicit examples and counterexamples, and discusses limitations and open problems for further research. Overall, this work establishes a unified mathematical foundation for digital phenomena and offers a versatile toolset for modeling and analyzing digit patterns in applied and theoretical contexts.

Abstract: Cervical cancer is among the most commonly occurring cancer among women and claims a huge number of lives in low and middle-income countries despite being relatively easy to treat. Several studies have shown that public screening programs can bring down cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates significantly. While several screening tests are available, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) presents itself as the most viable option for low-resource settings due to the affordability and simplicity of performing the test. VIA requires a trained medical professional to interpret the test and is subjective in nature. Automating VIA using AI eliminates subjectivity and would allow shifting of the task to less trained health workers. Task shifting with AI would help further expedite screening programs in low-resource settings. In our work, we propose a lightweight deep learning algorithm that includes EfficientDet-Lite3 as the Region of Interest (ROI) detector and a MobileNet- V2 based model for classification. These models would be deployed on an android-based device that can operate remotely and provide almost instant results without the requirement of highly-trained medical professionals, labs, sophisticated infrastructure, or internet connectivity. The classification model gives an accuracy of 92.31%, a sensitivity of 98.24%, and a specificity of 88.37% on the test dataset and presents itself as a promising automated low-resource screening approach.

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness. Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches 82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion, enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates (e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM, LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively). Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is the problem of sequentially estimating the state of a dynamical system from noisy observations. Recent advances in generative modeling have inspired new approaches to DA in high-dimensional nonlinear settings, especially the ensemble score filter (EnSF). However, these come at a significant computational burden due to slow sampling. In this paper, we introduce a new filtering framework based on flow matching (FM) -- called the ensemble flow filter (EnFF) -- to accelerate sampling and enable flexible design of probability paths. EnFF -- a training-free DA approach -- integrates MC estimators for the marginal FM vector field (VF) and a localized guidance to assimilate observations. EnFF has faster sampling and more flexibility in VF design compared to existing generative modeling for DA. Theoretically, we show that EnFF encompasses classical filtering methods such as the bootstrap particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter as special cases. Experiments on high-dimensional filtering benchmarks demonstrate improved cost-accuracy tradeoffs and the ability to leverage larger ensembles than prior methods. Our results highlight the promise of FM as a scalable tool for filtering in high-dimensional applications that enable the use of large ensembles.

<title>A Risk Manager for Intrusion Tolerant Systems: Enhancing HAL 9000 with New Scoring and Data Sources</title>

Abstract: Intrusion Tolerant Systems (ITSs) have become increasingly critical due to the rise of multi-domain adversaries exploiting diverse attack surfaces. ITS architectures aim to tolerate intrusions, ensuring system compromise is prevented or mitigated even with adversary presence. Existing ITS solutions often employ Risk Managers leveraging public security intelligence to adjust system defenses dynamically against emerging threats. However, these approaches rely heavily on databases like NVD and ExploitDB, which require manual analysis for newly discovered vulnerabilities. This dependency limits the system's responsiveness to rapidly evolving threats. HAL 9000, an ITS Risk Manager introduced in our prior work, addressed these challenges through machine learning. By analyzing descriptions of known vulnerabilities, HAL 9000 predicts and assesses new vulnerabilities automatically. To calculate the risk of a system, it also incorporates the Exploitability Probability Scoring system to estimate the likelihood of exploitation within 30 days, enhancing proactive defense capabilities.
  Despite its success, HAL 9000's reliance on NVD and ExploitDB knowledge is a limitation, considering the availability of other sources of information. This extended work introduces a custom-built scraper that continuously mines diverse threat sources, including security advisories, research forums, and real-time exploit proofs-of-concept. This significantly expands HAL 9000's intelligence base, enabling earlier detection and assessment of unverified vulnerabilities. Our evaluation demonstrates that integrating scraper-derived intelligence with HAL 9000's risk management framework substantially improves its ability to address emerging threats. This paper details the scraper's integration into the architecture, its role in providing additional information on new threats, and the effects on HAL 9000's management.

Abstract: Earth observation analytics have the potential to serve many time-sensitive applications. However, due to limited bandwidth and duration of ground-satellite connections, it takes hours or even days to download and analyze data from existing Earth observation satellites, making real-time demands like timely disaster response impossible. Toward real-time analytics, we introduce OrbitChain, a collaborative analytics framework that orchestrates computational resources across multiple satellites in an Earth observation constellation. OrbitChain decomposes analytics applications into microservices and allocates computational resources for time-constrained analysis. A traffic routing algorithm is devised to minimize the inter-satellite communication overhead. OrbitChain adopts a pipeline workflow that completes Earth observation tasks in real-time, facilitates time-sensitive applications and inter-constellation collaborations such as tip-and-cue. To evaluate OrbitChain, we implement a hardware-in-the-loop orbital computing testbed. Experiments show that our system can complete up to 60% analytics workload than existing Earth observation analytics framework while reducing the communication overhead by up to 72%.

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured, multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs. Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449 tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50 baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved 95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50. In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

<title>LLM-Enhanced Linear Autoencoders for Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic representation of textual item information in recommender systems. However, existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich textual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20. The source code is available at https://github.com/jaewan7599/L3AE_CIKM2025.

<title>Heterogeneous Influence Maximization in User Recommendation</title>

Abstract: User recommendation systems enhance user engagement by encouraging users to act as inviters to interact with other users (invitees), potentially fostering information propagation. Conventional recommendation methods typically focus on modeling interaction willingness. Influence-Maximization (IM) methods focus on identifying a set of users to maximize the information propagation. However, existing methods face two significant challenges. First, recommendation methods fail to unleash the candidates' spread capability. Second, IM methods fail to account for the willingness to interact. To solve these issues, we propose two models named HeteroIR and HeteroIM. HeteroIR provides an intuitive solution to unleash the dissemination potential of user recommendation systems. HeteroIM fills the gap between the IM method and the recommendation task, improving interaction willingness and maximizing spread coverage. The HeteroIR introduces a two-stage framework to estimate the spread profits. The HeteroIM incrementally selects the most influential invitee to recommend and rerank based on the number of reverse reachable (RR) sets containing inviters and invitees. RR set denotes a set of nodes that can reach a target via propagation. Extensive experiments show that HeteroIR and HeteroIM significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines with the p-value < 0.05. Furthermore, we have deployed HeteroIR and HeteroIM in Tencent's online gaming platforms and gained an 8.5\% and 10\% improvement in the online A/B test, respectively. Implementation codes are available at https://github.com/socialalgo/HIM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50 split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from 47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead, we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

<title>Compressed Models are NOT Trust-equivalent to Their Large Counterparts</title>

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks: natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

Abstract: The ninth AI City Challenge continues to advance real-world applications of computer vision and AI in transportation, industrial automation, and public safety. The 2025 edition featured four tracks and saw a 17% increase in participation, with 245 teams from 15 countries registered on the evaluation server. Public release of challenge datasets led to over 30,000 downloads to date. Track 1 focused on multi-class 3D multi-camera tracking, involving people, humanoids, autonomous mobile robots, and forklifts, using detailed calibration and 3D bounding box annotations. Track 2 tackled video question answering in traffic safety, with multi-camera incident understanding enriched by 3D gaze labels. Track 3 addressed fine-grained spatial reasoning in dynamic warehouse environments, requiring AI systems to interpret RGB-D inputs and answer spatial questions that combine perception, geometry, and language. Both Track 1 and Track 3 datasets were generated in NVIDIA Omniverse. Track 4 emphasized efficient road object detection from fisheye cameras, supporting lightweight, real-time deployment on edge devices. The evaluation framework enforced submission limits and used a partially held-out test set to ensure fair benchmarking. Final rankings were revealed after the competition concluded, fostering reproducibility and mitigating overfitting. Several teams achieved top-tier results, setting new benchmarks in multiple tasks.

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems aim to generate a recommendation list comprising the most relevant or similar items to the user's profile. These approaches can create recommendation lists that omit item genres from the less prominent areas of a user's profile, thereby undermining the user's experience. To solve this problem, the calibrated recommendation system provides a guarantee of including less representative areas in the recommended list. The calibrated context works with three distributions. The first is from the user's profile, the second is from the candidate items, and the last is from the recommendation list. These distributions are G-dimensional, where G is the total number of genres in the system. This high dimensionality requires a different evaluation method, considering that traditional recommenders operate in a one-dimensional data space. In this sense, we implement fifteen models that help to understand how these distributions are structured. We evaluate the users' patterns in three datasets from the movie domain. The results indicate that the models of outlier detection provide a better understanding of the structures. The calibrated system creates recommendation lists that act similarly to traditional recommendation lists, allowing users to change their groups of preferences to the same degree.

Abstract: Many safety-critical real-world problems, such as autonomous driving and collaborative robots, are of a distributed multi-agent nature. To optimize the performance of these systems while ensuring safety, we can cast them as distributed optimization problems, where each agent aims to optimize their parameters to maximize a coupled reward function subject to coupled constraints. Prior work either studies a centralized setting, does not consider safety, or struggles with sample efficiency. Since we require sample efficiency and work with unknown and nonconvex rewards and constraints, we solve this optimization problem using safe Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression. Moreover, we consider nearest-neighbor communication between the agents. To capture the behavior of non-neighboring agents, we reformulate the static global optimization problem as a time-varying local optimization problem for each agent, essentially introducing time as a latent variable. To this end, we propose a custom spatio-temporal kernel to integrate prior knowledge. We show the successful deployment of our algorithm in simulations.

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges. However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker (NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively, refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results across various tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities remain a fundamental challenge. Developing AI systems with strong reasoning capabilities is regarded as a crucial milestone in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and has garnered considerable attention from both academia and industry. Various techniques have been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, with neuro-symbolic approaches being a particularly promising way. This paper comprehensively reviews recent developments in neuro-symbolic approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning. We first present a formalization of reasoning tasks and give a brief introduction to the neurosymbolic learning paradigm. Then, we discuss neuro-symbolic methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs from three perspectives: Symbolic->LLM, LLM->Symbolic, and LLM+Symbolic. Finally, we discuss several key challenges and promising future directions. We have also released a GitHub repository including papers and resources related to this survey: https://github.com/LAMDASZ-ML/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-with-NeSy.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments, investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3 (74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance, decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

Abstract: Biometric authentication using physiological signals offers a promising path toward secure and user-friendly access control in wearable devices. While electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have shown high discriminability, their intrusive sensing requirements and discontinuous acquisition limit practicality. Photoplethysmography (PPG), on the other hand, enables continuous, non-intrusive authentication with seamless integration into wrist-worn wearable devices. However, most prior work relies on high-frequency PPG (e.g., 75 - 500 Hz) and complex deep models, which incur significant energy and computational overhead, impeding deployment in power-constrained real-world systems. In this paper, we present the first real-world implementation and evaluation of a continuous authentication system on a smartwatch, We-Be Band, using low-frequency (25 Hz) multi-channel PPG signals. Our method employs a Bi-LSTM with attention mechanism to extract identity-specific features from short (4 s) windows of 4-channel PPG. Through extensive evaluations on both public datasets (PTTPPG) and our We-Be Dataset (26 subjects), we demonstrate strong classification performance with an average test accuracy of 88.11%, macro F1-score of 0.88, False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.48%, False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 11.77%, and Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.76%. Our 25 Hz system reduces sensor power consumption by 53% compared to 512 Hz and 19% compared to 128 Hz setups without compromising performance. We find that sampling at 25 Hz preserves authentication accuracy, whereas performance drops sharply at 20 Hz while offering only trivial additional power savings, underscoring 25 Hz as the practical lower bound. Additionally, we find that models trained exclusively on resting data fail under motion, while activity-diverse training improves robustness across physiological states.

Abstract: With the widespread use of the internet, there is an increasing need to ensure the security and privacy of transmitted data. This has led to an intensified focus on the study of video steganography, which is a technique that hides data within a video cover to avoid detection. The effectiveness of any steganography method depends on its ability to embed data without altering the original video quality while maintaining high efficiency. This paper proposes a new method to video steganography, which involves utilizing a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for identifying the Region of Interest (ROI) in the cover video. The ROI is the area in the video that is the most suitable for data embedding. The secret data is encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is a widely accepted encryption standard, before being embedded into the cover video, utilizing up to 10% of the cover video. This process ensures the security and confidentiality of the embedded data. The performance metrics for assessing the proposed method are the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and the encoding and decoding time. The results show that the proposed method has a high embedding capacity and efficiency, with a PSNR ranging between 64 and 75 dBs, which indicates that the embedded data is almost indistinguishable from the original video. Additionally, the method can encode and decode data quickly, making it efficient for real time applications.

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features, known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information, concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities, the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity, achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Abstract: Functional data, i.e., smooth random functions observed over a continuous domain, are increasingly available in areas such as biomedical research, health informatics, and epidemiology. However, effective statistical analysis for functional data is often hindered by challenges such as privacy constraints, sparse and irregular sampling, infinite dimensionality, and non-Gaussian structures. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework named Smooth Flow Matching (SFM), tailored for generative modeling of functional data to enable statistical analysis without exposing sensitive real data. Built upon flow-matching ideas, SFM constructs a semiparametric copula flow to generate infinite-dimensional functional data, free from Gaussianity or low-rank assumptions. It is computationally efficient, handles irregular observations, and guarantees the smoothness of the generated functions, offering a practical and flexible solution in scenarios where existing deep generative methods are not applicable. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the advantages of SFM in terms of both synthetic data quality and computational efficiency. We then apply SFM to generate clinical trajectory data from the MIMIC-IV patient electronic health records (EHR) longitudinal database. Our analysis showcases the ability of SFM to produce high-quality surrogate data for downstream statistical tasks, highlighting its potential to boost the utility of EHR data for clinical applications.

Abstract: Selecting a subset of promising candidates from a large pool is crucial across various scientific and real-world applications. Conformal selection offers a distribution-free and model-agnostic framework for candidate selection with uncertainty quantification. While effective in offline settings, its application to online scenarios, where data arrives sequentially, poses challenges. Notably, conformal selection permits the deselection of previously selected candidates, which is incompatible with applications requiring irreversible selection decisions. This limitation is particularly evident in resource-intensive sequential processes, such as drug discovery, where advancing a compound to subsequent stages renders reversal impractical. To address this issue, we extend conformal selection to an online Accept-to-Reject Changes (ARC) procedure: non-selected data points can be reconsidered for selection later, and once a candidate is selected, the decision is irreversible. Specifically, we propose a novel conformal selection method, Online Conformal Selection with Accept-to-Reject Changes (dubbed OCS-ARC), which incorporates online Benjamini-Hochberg procedure into the candidate selection process. We provide theoretical guarantees that OCS-ARC controls the false discovery rate (FDR) at or below the nominal level at any timestep under both i.i.d. and exchangeable data assumptions. Additionally, we theoretically show that our approach naturally extends to multivariate response settings. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that OCS-ARC significantly improves selection power over the baseline while maintaining valid FDR control across all examined timesteps.

Abstract: We study theoretical predictive performance of ridge and ridge-less least-squares regression when covariate vectors arise from evaluating $p$ random, means-square continuous functions over a latent metric space at $n$ random and unobserved locations, subject to additive noise. This leads us away from the standard assumption of i.i.d. data to a setting in which the $n$ covariate vectors are exchangeable but not independent in general. Under an assumption of independence across dimensions, $4$-th order moment, and other regularity conditions, we obtain probabilistic bounds on a notion of predictive excess risk adapted to our random functional covariate setting, making use of recent results of Barzilai and Shamir. We derive convergence rates in regimes where $p$ grows suitably fast relative to $n$, illustrating interplay between ingredients of the model in determining convergence behaviour and the role of additive covariate noise in benign-overfitting.

Abstract: Max-linear Bayesian networks (MLBNs) are a relatively recent class of structural equation models which arise when the random variables involved have heavy-tailed distributions. Unlike most directed graphical models, MLBNs are typically not faithful to d-separation and thus classical causal discovery algorithms such as the PC algorithm or greedy equivalence search can not be used to accurately recover the true graph structure. In this paper, we begin the study of constraint-based discovery algorithms for MLBNs given an oracle for testing conditional independence in the true, unknown graph. We show that if the oracle is given by the $\ast$-separation criteria in the true graph, then the PC algorithm remains consistent despite the presence of additional CI statements implied by $\ast$-separation. We also introduce a new causal discovery algorithm named "PCstar" which assumes faithfulness to $C^\ast$-separation and is able to orient additional edges which cannot be oriented with only d- or $\ast$-separation.

Abstract: Multidimensional data is often associated with uncertainties that are not well-described by normal distributions. In this work, we describe how such distributions can be projected to a low-dimensional space using uncertainty-aware principal component analysis (UAPCA). We propose to model multidimensional distributions using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and derive the projection from a general formulation that allows projecting arbitrary probability density functions. The low-dimensional projections of the densities exhibit more details about the distributions and represent them more faithfully compared to UAPCA mappings. Further, we support including user-defined weights between the different distributions, which allows for varying the importance of the multidimensional distributions. We evaluate our approach by comparing the distributions in low-dimensional space obtained by our method and UAPCA to those obtained by sample-based projections.

Abstract: Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the "seeing-to-doing gap," which stems from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.

To better understand H-theorem and its relation to the arrow of time, we study the equilibration of randomly oriented and positioned hard disks with periodic boundary conditions. Using a model based on the DeepSets architecture, which imposes permutation invariance of the particle labels, we train a model to capture the irreversibility of the H-functional.

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks. Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1) generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance gains.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an adversary manipulates the model behavior through overlaying images with special triggers. Existing backdoor defense methods often require accessing a few validation data and model parameters, which is impractical in many real-world applications, e.g., when the model is provided as a cloud service. In this paper, we address the practical task of blind backdoor defense at test time, in particular for local attacks and black-box models. The true label of every test image needs to be recovered on the fly from a suspicious model regardless of image benignity. We consider test-time image purification that incapacitates local triggers while keeping semantic contents intact. Due to diverse trigger patterns and sizes, the heuristic trigger search can be unscalable. We circumvent such barrier by leveraging the strong reconstruction power of generative models, and propose Blind Defense with Masked AutoEncoder (BDMAE). BDMAE detects possible local triggers using image structural similarity and label consistency between the test image and MAE restorations. The detection results are then refined by considering trigger topology. Finally, we fuse MAE restorations adaptively into a purified image for making prediction. Extensive experiments under different backdoor settings validate its effectiveness and generalizability.

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations from unlabelled data is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Solving it may unlock other problems, such as generalization, interpretability, or fairness. Although remarkably challenging to solve in theory, disentanglement is often achieved in practice through prior matching. Furthermore, recent works have shown that prior matching approaches can be enhanced by leveraging geometrical considerations, e.g., by learning representations that preserve geometric features of the data, such as distances or angles between points. However, matching the prior while preserving geometric features is challenging, as a mapping that fully preserves these features while aligning the data distribution with the prior does not exist in general. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach to disentangled representation learning based on quadratic optimal transport. We formulate the problem using Gromov-Monge maps that transport one distribution onto another with minimal distortion of predefined geometric features, preserving them as much as can be achieved. To compute such maps, we propose the Gromov-Monge-Gap (GMG), a regularizer quantifying whether a map moves a reference distribution with minimal geometry distortion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for disentanglement across four standard benchmarks, outperforming other methods leveraging geometric considerations.

Abstract: Herein the topics of (natural) gradient descent, data decorrelation, and approximate methods for backpropagation are brought into a common discussion. Natural gradient descent illuminates how gradient vectors, pointing at directions of steepest descent, can be improved by considering the local curvature of loss landscapes. We extend this perspective and show that to fully solve the problem illuminated by natural gradients in neural networks, one must recognise that correlations in the data at any linear transformation, including node responses at every layer of a neural network, cause a non-orthonormal relationship between the model's parameters. To solve this requires a method for decorrelating inputs at each individual layer of a neural network. We describe a range of methods which have been proposed for decorrelation and whitening of node output, and expand on these to provide a novel method specifically useful for distributed computing and computational neuroscience. Implementing decorrelation within multi-layer neural networks, we can show that not only is training via backpropagation sped up significantly but also existing approximations of backpropagation, which have failed catastrophically in the past, benefit significantly in their accuracy and convergence speed. This has the potential to provide a route forward for approximate gradient descent methods which have previously been discarded, training approaches for analogue and neuromorphic hardware, and potentially insights as to the efficacy and utility of decorrelation processes in the brain.

Abstract: We study a federated classification problem over a network of multiple clients and a central server, in which each client's local data remains private and is subject to uncertainty in both the features and labels. To address these uncertainties, we develop a novel Federated Distributionally Robust Support Vector Machine (FDR-SVM), robustifying the classification boundary against perturbations in local data distributions. Specifically, the data at each client is governed by a unique true distribution that is unknown. To handle this heterogeneity, we develop a novel Mixture of Wasserstein Balls (MoWB) ambiguity set, naturally extending the classical Wasserstein ball to the federated setting. We then establish theoretical guarantees for our proposed MoWB, deriving an out-of-sample performance bound and showing that its design preserves the separability of the FDR-SVM optimization problem. Next, we rigorously derive two algorithms that solve the FDR-SVM problem and analyze their convergence behavior as well as their worst-case time complexity. We evaluate our algorithms on industrial data and various UCI datasets, whereby we demonstrate that they frequently outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Probabilistic time series imputation has been widely applied in real-world scenarios due to its ability for uncertainty estimation and denoising diffusion probabilistic models~(DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)\textit{The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the dependencies in the time series data effectively.} To address the first challenge, we explore the potential of state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denoising module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for time series data modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple real-world datasets.

Abstract: The stringent regulatory requirements on nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from diesel compression ignition engines require accurate and reliable models for real-time monitoring and diagnostics. Although traditional methods such as physical sensors and virtual engine control module (ECM) sensors provide essential data, they are only used for estimation. Ubiquitous literature primarily focuses on deterministic models with little emphasis on capturing the various uncertainties. The lack of probabilistic frameworks restricts the applicability of these models for robust diagnostics. The objective of this paper is to develop and validate a probabilistic model to predict engine-out NOx emissions using Gaussian process regression. Our approach is as follows. We employ three variants of Gaussian process models: the first with a standard radial basis function kernel with input window, the second incorporating a deep kernel using convolutional neural networks to capture temporal dependencies, and the third enriching the deep kernel with a causal graph derived via graph convolutional networks. The causal graph embeds physics knowledge into the learning process. All models are compared against a virtual ECM sensor using both quantitative and qualitative metrics. We conclude that our model provides an improvement in predictive performance when using an input window and a deep kernel structure. Even more compelling is the further enhancement achieved by the incorporation of a causal graph into the deep kernel. These findings are corroborated across different verification and validation datasets.

Abstract: Model merging, particularly through weight averaging, has shown surprising effectiveness in saving computations and improving model performance without any additional training. However, the interpretability of why and how this technique works remains unclear. In this work, we reinterpret weight-averaged model merging through the lens of interpretability and provide empirical insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern its behavior. We approach the problem from three perspectives: (1) we analyze the learned weight structures and demonstrate that model weights encode structured representations that help explain the compatibility of weight averaging; (2) we compare averaging in weight space and feature space across diverse model architectures (CNNs and ViTs) and datasets, aiming to expose under which circumstances what combination paradigm will work more effectively; (3) we study the effect of parameter scaling on prediction stability, highlighting how weight averaging acts as a form of regularization that contributes to robustness. By framing these analyses in an interpretability context, our work contributes to a more transparent and systematic understanding of model merging for stakeholders interested in the safety and reliability of untrained model combination methods.

We mathematically justify a previously proposed score-difference-based memorization metric by demonstrating its effectiveness in quantifying sharpness. Additionally, we propose a novel memorization metric that captures sharpness at the initial stage of image generation in latent diffusion models, offering early insights into potential memorization. Leveraging this metric, we develop a mitigation strategy that optimizes the initial noise of the generation process using a sharpness-aware regularization term.

This work introduces DDD-GenDT, a dynamic data-driven generative digital twin framework grounded in the Dynamic Data-Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) paradigm. The architecture comprises the Physical Twin Observation Graph (PTOG) to represent operational states, an Observation Window Extraction process to capture temporal sequences, a Data Preprocessing Pipeline for sensor structuring and filtering, and an LLM ensemble for zero-shot predictive inference. By leveraging generative AI, DDD-GenDT reduces reliance on extensive historical datasets, enabling DT construction in data-scarce settings while maintaining industrial data privacy. The DDDAS feedback mechanism allows the DT to autonomically adapt predictions to physical twin (PT) wear and degradation, supporting DT-aging, which ensures progressive synchronization of DT with PT evolution. The framework is validated using the NASA CNC milling dataset, with spindle current as the monitored variable. In a zero-shot setting, the GPT-4-based DT achieves an average RMSE of 0.479 A (4.79% of the 10 A spindle current), accurately modeling nonlinear process dynamics and PT aging without retraining. These results show that DDD-GenDT provides a generalizable, data-efficient, and adaptive DT modeling approach, bridging generative AI with the performance and reliability requirements of industrial DT applications.

Abstract: This article presents a generic approach to convolution that significantly differs from conventional methodologies in the current Machine Learning literature. The approach, in its mathematical aspects, proved to be clear and concise, particularly when high-order tensors are involved. In this context, a rational theory of regression in neural networks is developed, as a framework for a generic view of sparse convolutional neural networks, the primary focus of this study. As a direct outcome, the classic Backpropagation Algorithm is redefined to align with this rational tensor-based approach and presented in its simplest, most generic form.

Abstract: Wireless communications rely on path loss modeling, which is most effective when it includes the physical details of the propagation environment. Acquiring this data has historically been challenging, but geographic information systems data is becoming increasingly available with higher resolution and accuracy. Access to such details enables propagation models to more accurately predict coverage and account for interference in wireless deployments. Machine learning-based modeling can significantly support this effort, with feature based approaches allowing for accurate, efficient, and scalable propagation modeling. Building on previous work, we introduce an extended set of features that improves prediction accuracy while, most importantly, proving model generalization through rigorous statistical assessment and the use of test set holdouts.

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for backpropagation-free learning employ local error feedback to direct iterative optimisation via gradient descent. In this study, we examine the more restrictive setting where retrograde communication from neuronal outputs is unavailable for pre-synaptic weight optimisation. To address this challenge, we propose Forward Projection (FP). This novel randomised closed-form training method requires only a single forward pass over the entire dataset for model fitting, without retrograde communication. Target values for pre-activation membrane potentials are generated layer-wise via nonlinear projections of pre-synaptic inputs and the labels. Local loss functions are optimised over pre-synaptic inputs using closed-form regression, without feedback from neuronal outputs or downstream layers. Interpretability is a key advantage of FP training; membrane potentials of hidden neurons in FP-trained networks encode information which is interpretable layer-wise as label predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FP across four biomedical datasets. In few-shot learning tasks, FP yielded more generalisable models than those optimised via backpropagation. In large-sample tasks, FP-based models achieve generalisation comparable to gradient descent-based local learning methods while requiring only a single forward propagation step, achieving significant speed up for training. Interpretation functions defined on local neuronal activity in FP-based models successfully identified clinically salient features for diagnosis in two biomedical datasets. Forward Projection is a computationally efficient machine learning approach that yields interpretable neural network models without retrograde communication of neuronal activity during training.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) offer a flexible framework for parameterizing probability distributions using neural networks. However, learning EBMs by exact maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is generally intractable, due to the need to compute the partition function (normalization constant). In this paper, we propose a novel formulation for approximately learning probabilistic EBMs in combinatorially-large discrete spaces, such as sets or permutations. Our key idea is to jointly learn both an energy model and its log-partition, both parameterized as a neural network. Our approach not only provides a novel tractable objective criterion to learn EBMs by stochastic gradient descent (without relying on MCMC), but also a novel means to estimate the log-partition function on unseen data points. On the theoretical side, we show that our approach recovers the optimal MLE solution when optimizing in the space of continuous functions. Furthermore, we show that our approach naturally extends to the broader family of Fenchel-Young losses, allowing us to obtain the first tractable method for optimizing the sparsemax loss in combinatorially-large spaces. We demonstrate our approach on multilabel classification and label ranking.

Abstract: This paper introduces a cost-efficient active learning (AL) framework for classification, featuring a novel query design called candidate set query. Unlike traditional AL queries requiring the oracle to examine all possible classes, our method narrows down the set of candidate classes likely to include the ground-truth class, significantly reducing the search space and labeling cost. Moreover, we leverage conformal prediction to dynamically generate small yet reliable candidate sets, adapting to model enhancement over successive AL rounds. To this end, we introduce an acquisition function designed to prioritize data points that offer high information gain at lower cost. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet64x64 demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our framework. Notably, it reduces labeling cost by 48% on ImageNet64x64.

Abstract: This paper provides a theoretical analysis of a new learning problem for recommender systems where users provide feedback by comparing pairs of items instead of rating them individually. We assume that comparisons stem from latent user and item features, which reduces the task of predicting preferences to learning these features from comparison data. Similar to the classical matrix factorization problem, the main challenge in this learning task is that the resulting loss function is nonconvex. Our analysis shows that the loss function exhibits (restricted) strong convexity near the true solution, which ensures gradient-based methods converge exponentially, given an appropriate warm start. Importantly, this result holds in a sparse data regime, where each user compares only a few pairs of items. Our main technical contribution is to extend certain concentration inequalities commonly used in matrix completion to our model. Our work demonstrates that learning personalized recommendations from comparison data is computationally and statistically efficient.

Abstract: We propose a physics-based regularization technique for function learning, inspired by statistical mechanics. By drawing an analogy between optimizing the parameters of an interpolator and minimizing the energy of a system, we introduce corrections that impose constraints on the lower-order moments of the data distribution. This minimizes the discrepancy between the discrete and continuum representations of the data, in turn allowing to access more favorable energy landscapes, thus improving the accuracy of the interpolator. Our approach improves performance in both interpolation and regression tasks, even in high-dimensional spaces. Unlike traditional methods, it does not require empirical parameter tuning, making it particularly effective for handling noisy data. We also show that thanks to its local nature, the method offers computational and memory efficiency advantages over Radial Basis Function interpolators, especially for large datasets.

Abstract: Recent developments in sequential experimental design look to construct a policy that can efficiently navigate the design space, in a way that maximises the expected information gain. Whilst there is work on achieving tractable policies for experimental design problems, there is significantly less work on obtaining policies that are able to generalise well - i.e. able to give good performance despite a change in the underlying statistical properties of the experiments. Conducting experiments sequentially has recently brought about the use of reinforcement learning, where an agent is trained to navigate the design space to select the most informative designs for experimentation. However, there is still a lack of understanding about the benefits and drawbacks of using certain reinforcement learning algorithms to train these agents. In our work, we investigate several reinforcement learning algorithms and their efficacy in producing agents that take maximally informative design decisions in sequential experimental design scenarios. We find that agent performance is impacted depending on the algorithm used for training, and that particular algorithms, using dropout or ensemble approaches, empirically showcase attractive generalisation properties.

Abstract: In this work, we will establish that the Langevin Monte-Carlo algorithm can learn depth-2 neural nets of any size and for any data and we give non-asymptotic convergence rates for it. We achieve this via showing that in q-Renyi divergence, the iterates of Langevin Monte Carlo converge to the Gibbs distribution of Frobenius norm regularized losses for any of these nets, when using smooth activations and in both classification and regression settings. Most critically, the amount of regularization needed for our results is independent of the size of the net. This result achieves a synthesis of several recent observations about isoperimetry conditions under which LMC converges and that two-layer neural loss functions can always be regularized by a certain constant amount such that they satisfy the Villani conditions, and thus their Gibbs measures satisfy a Poincare inequality.

Abstract: Gradient optimization-based adversarial attack methods automate the learning of adversarial triggers to generate jailbreak prompts or leak system prompts. In this work, we take a closer look at the optimization objective of adversarial trigger learning and propose ATLA: Adversarial Trigger Learning with Augmented objectives. ATLA improves the negative log-likelihood loss used by previous studies into a weighted loss formulation that encourages the learned adversarial triggers to optimize more towards response format tokens. This enables ATLA to learn an adversarial trigger from just one query-response pair and the learned trigger generalizes well to other similar queries. We further design a variation to augment trigger optimization with an auxiliary loss that suppresses evasive responses. We showcase how to use ATLA to learn adversarial suffixes jailbreaking LLMs and to extract hidden system prompts. Empirically we demonstrate that ATLA consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, achieving nearly 100% success in attacking while requiring 80% fewer queries. ATLA learned jailbreak suffixes demonstrate high generalization to unseen queries and transfer well to new LLMs. We released our code https://github.com/QData/ALTA_Augmented_Adversarial_Trigger_Learning

Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) are composed of multiple types of nodes and edges, making it more effective in capturing the complex relational structures inherent in the real world. However, in real-world scenarios, labeled data is often difficult to obtain, which limits the applicability of semi-supervised approaches. Self-supervised learning aims to enable models to automatically learn useful features from data, effectively addressing the challenge of limited labeling data. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework for heterogeneous graphs (ASHGCL), which incorporates three distinct views, each focusing on node attributes, high-order and low-order structural information, respectively, to effectively capture attribute information, high-order structures, and low-order structures for node representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce an attribute-enhanced positive sample selection strategy that combines both structural information and attribute information, effectively addressing the issue of sampling bias. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that ASHGCL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised baselines and even surpasses some supervised benchmarks.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of Column Generation (CG) using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, we use a RL model based on the attention-mechanism architecture to find the columns with most negative reduced cost in the Pricing Problem (PP). Unlike previous Machine Learning (ML) applications for CG, our model deploys an end-to-end mechanism as it independently solves the pricing problem without the help of any heuristic. We consider a variant of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) as a case study for our method. Through a set of experiments where our method is compared against a Dynamic Programming (DP)-based heuristic for solving the PP, we show that our method solves the linear relaxation up to a reasonable objective gap in significantly shorter running times.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) learn rich semantic representations in audio classification through an efficient self-supervised reconstruction task. However, general-purpose models fail to generalize well when applied directly to fine-grained audio domains. Specifically, bird-sound classification requires distinguishing subtle inter-species differences and managing high intra-species acoustic variability, revealing the performance limitations of general-domain Audio-MAEs. This work demonstrates that bridging this domain gap domain gap requires full-pipeline adaptation, not just domain-specific pretraining data. We systematically revisit and adapt the pretraining recipe, fine-tuning methods, and frozen feature utilization to bird sounds using BirdSet, a large-scale bioacoustic dataset comparable to AudioSet. Our resulting Bird-MAE achieves new state-of-the-art results in BirdSet's multi-label classification benchmark. Additionally, we introduce the parameter-efficient prototypical probing, enhancing the utility of frozen MAE representations and closely approaching fine-tuning performance in low-resource settings. Bird-MAE's prototypical probes outperform linear probing by up to 37 percentage points in mean average precision and narrow the gap to fine-tuning across BirdSet downstream tasks. Bird-MAE also demonstrates robust few-shot capabilities with prototypical probing in our newly established few-shot benchmark on BirdSet, highlighting the potential of tailored self-supervised learning pipelines for fine-grained audio domains.

Abstract: Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (GFSCIL) enables models to continually learn from limited samples of novel tasks after initial training on a large base dataset. Existing GFSCIL approaches typically utilize Prototypical Networks (PNs) for metric-based class representations and fine-tune the model during the incremental learning stage. However, these PN-based methods oversimplify learning via novel query set fine-tuning and fail to integrate Graph Continual Learning (GCL) techniques due to architectural constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a more rigorous and practical setting for GFSCIL that excludes query sets during the incremental training phase. Building on this foundation, we introduce Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning (MEGA), aimed at effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting for GFSCIL. Specifically, by calculating the incremental second-order gradient during the meta-training stage, we endow the model to learn high-quality priors that enhance incremental learning by aligning its behaviors across both the meta-training and incremental learning stages. Extensive experiments on four mainstream graph datasets demonstrate that MEGA achieves state-of-the-art results and enhances the effectiveness of various GCL methods in GFSCIL. We believe that our proposed MEGA serves as a model-agnostic GFSCIL paradigm, paving the way for future research.

Abstract: The emergence of large pre-trained networks has revolutionized the AI field, unlocking new possibilities and achieving unprecedented performance. However, these models inherit a fundamental limitation from traditional Machine Learning approaches: their strong dependence on the \textit{i.i.d.} assumption hinders their adaptability to dynamic learning scenarios. We believe the next breakthrough in AI lies in enabling efficient adaptation to evolving environments -- such as the real world -- where new data and tasks arrive sequentially. This challenge defines the field of Continual Learning (CL), a Machine Learning paradigm focused on developing lifelong learning neural models. One alternative to efficiently adapt these large-scale models is known Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). These methods tackle the issue of adapting the model to a particular data or scenario by performing small and efficient modifications, achieving similar performance to full fine-tuning. However, these techniques still lack the ability to adjust the model to multiple tasks continually, as they suffer from the issue of Catastrophic Forgetting. In this survey, we first provide an overview of CL algorithms and PEFT methods before reviewing the state-of-the-art on Parameter-Efficient Continual Fine-Tuning (PECFT). We examine various approaches, discuss evaluation metrics, and explore potential future research directions. Our goal is to highlight the synergy between CL and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, guide researchers in this field, and pave the way for novel future research directions.

Abstract: In practical settings, differentially private Federated learning (DP-FL) is the dominant method for training models from private, on-device client data. Recent work has suggested that DP-FL may be enhanced or outperformed by methods that use DP synthetic data (Wu et al., 2024; Hou et al., 2024). The primary algorithms for generating DP synthetic data for FL applications require careful prompt engineering based on public information and/or iterative private client feedback. Our key insight is that the private client feedback collected by prior DP synthetic data methods (Hou et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024) can be viewed as an RL (reinforcement learning) reward. Our algorithm, Policy Optimization for Private Data (POPri) harnesses client feedback using policy optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune LLMs to generate high-quality DP synthetic data. To evaluate POPri, we release LargeFedBench, a new federated text benchmark for uncontaminated LLM evaluations on federated client data. POPri substantially improves the utility of DP synthetic data relative to prior work on LargeFedBench datasets and an existing benchmark from Xie et al. (2024). POPri closes the gap between next-token prediction accuracy in the fully-private and non-private settings by up to 58%, compared to 28% for prior synthetic data methods, and 3% for state-of-the-art DP federated learning methods. The code and data are available at https://github.com/meiyuw/POPri.

Abstract: We highlight a curious empirical result within modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, self-attention catastrophically fails to train unless it is used in conjunction with a skip connection. This is in contrast to other elements of a ViT that continue to exhibit good performance (albeit suboptimal) when skip connections are removed. Further, we show that this critical dependence on skip connections is a relatively new phenomenon, with previous deep architectures (\eg, CNNs) exhibiting good performance in their absence. In this paper, we theoretically characterize that the self-attention mechanism is fundamentally ill-conditioned and is, therefore, uniquely dependent on skip connections for regularization. Additionally, we propose Token Graying -- a simple yet effective complement (to skip connections) that further improves the condition of input tokens. We validate our approach in both supervised and self-supervised training methods.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is pivotal in machine learning, especially for classification tasks, as it improves the robustness and reliability of models. We introduce a novel `Epistemic Wrapping' methodology aimed at improving uncertainty estimation in classification. Our approach uses Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) as a baseline and transforms their outputs into belief function posteriors, effectively capturing epistemic uncertainty and offering an efficient and general methodology for uncertainty quantification. Comprehensive experiments employing a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) baseline and an Interval Neural Network for inference on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that our Epistemic Wrapper significantly enhances generalisation and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: We train Transformer-based language models on ten foundational algorithmic tasks and observe pronounced phase transitions in their loss curves that deviate from established power-law scaling trends. Over large ranges of compute, the validation loss barely improves, then abruptly decreases. Probing the models' internal representations reveals that quiet features are learned prior to any decrease in task loss. These quiet features represent intermediate algorithmic computations that do not by themselves improve the output loss. Ablation experiments demonstrate that individual quiet features are causally necessary for task performance. Our results demonstrate that substantial representational progress can remain hidden beneath an apparently flat loss curve, challenging the prevailing use of cross-entropy as a proxy for learning and motivating richer diagnostics for monitoring model training.

Abstract: This position paper argues that achieving meaningful scientific and societal advances with artificial intelligence (AI) requires a responsible, application-driven approach (RAD) to AI research. As AI is increasingly integrated into society, AI researchers must engage with the specific contexts where AI is being applied. This includes being responsive to ethical and legal considerations, technical and societal constraints, and public discourse. We present the case for RAD-AI to drive research through a three-staged approach: (1) building transdisciplinary teams and people-centred studies; (2) addressing context-specific methods, ethical commitments, assumptions, and metrics; and (3) testing and sustaining efficacy through staged testbeds and a community of practice. We present a vision for the future of application-driven AI research to unlock new value through technically feasible methods that are adaptive to the contextual needs and values of the communities they ultimately serve.

Abstract: In this book chapter, we discuss recent advances in data-driven approaches for inverse problems. In particular, we focus on the \emph{paired autoencoder} framework, which has proven to be a powerful tool for solving inverse problems in scientific computing. The paired autoencoder framework is a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both data-driven and model-based methods by projecting both the data and the quantity of interest into a latent space and mapping these latent spaces to provide surrogate forward and inverse mappings. We illustrate the advantages of this approach through numerical experiments, including seismic imaging and classical inpainting: nonlinear and linear inverse problems, respectively. Although the paired autoencoder framework is likelihood-free, it generates multiple data- and model-based reconstruction metrics that help assess whether examples are in or out of distribution. In addition to direct model estimates from data, the paired autoencoder enables latent-space refinement to fit the observed data accurately. Numerical experiments show that this procedure, combined with the latent-space initial guess, is essential for high-quality estimates, even when data noise exceeds the training regime. We also introduce two novel variants that combine variational and paired autoencoder ideas, maintaining the original benefits while enabling sampling for uncertainty analysis.

<title>Bidirectional Information Flow (BIF) -- A Sample Efficient Hierarchical Gaussian Process for Bayesian Optimization</title>

Abstract: Hierarchical Gaussian Process (H-GP) models divide problems into different subtasks, allowing for different models to address each part, making them well-suited for problems with inherent hierarchical structure. However, typical H-GP models do not fully take advantage of this structure, only sending information up or down the hierarchy. This one-way coupling limits sample efficiency and slows convergence. We propose Bidirectional Information Flow (BIF), an efficient H-GP framework that establishes bidirectional information exchange between parent and child models in H-GPs for online training. BIF retains the modular structure of hierarchical models - the parent combines subtask knowledge from children GPs - while introducing top-down feedback to continually refine children models during online learning. This mutual exchange improves sample efficiency, enables robust training, and allows modular reuse of learned subtask models. BIF outperforms conventional H-GP Bayesian Optimization methods, achieving up to 4x and 3x higher $R^2$ scores for the parent and children respectively, on synthetic and real-world neurostimulation optimization tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across vision, language, and scientific domains. Despite their empirical success, prior theoretical analyses of the sample complexity suffer from poor scaling with input data dimension or rely on unrealistic assumptions such as access to exact empirical risk minimizers. In this work, we provide a principled analysis of score estimation, establishing a sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$. Our approach leverages a structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical, approximation, and optimization errors, enabling us to eliminate the exponential dependence on neural network parameters that arises in prior analyses. It is the first such result which achieves sample complexity bounds without assuming access to the empirical risk minimizer of score function estimation loss.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress, their proficiency in graph-related tasks remains notably limited, hindering the development of truly general-purpose models. Previous attempts, including pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we curate Erd\~os, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50 diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erd\~os, G1 obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully. Our implementation is open-sourced at https://github.com/PKU-ML/G1, with models and datasets hosted on Hugging Face collections https://huggingface.co/collections/PKU-ML/g1-683d659e992794fc99618cf2 for broader accessibility.

<title>Flexible Operator Fusion for Fast Sparse Transformer with Diverse Masking on GPU</title>

Abstract: Large language models are popular around the world due to their powerful understanding capabilities. As the core component of LLMs, accelerating Transformer through parallelization has gradually become a hot research topic. Mask layers introduce sparsity into Transformer to reduce calculations. However, previous works rarely focus on the performance optimization of sparse Transformer. Moreover, rule-based mechanisms ignore the fusion opportunities of mixed-type operators and fail to adapt to various sequence lengths. To address the above problems, we propose STOF, a framework that incorporates optimizations for Sparse Transformer via flexible masking and operator fusion on GPU. We firstly unify the storage format and kernel implementation for the multi-head attention. Then, we map fusion schemes to compilation templates and determine the optimal parameter setting through a two-stage search engine. The experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art work, STOF achieves maximum speedups of 1.7x in MHA computation and 1.5x in end-to-end inference.

Abstract: Using fewer bits to represent model parameters and related tensors during pre-training has become a required technique for improving GPU efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Microscaling (MX) formats introduced in NVIDIA Blackwell generation of GPUs represent a major advancement of this technique, making it practical to combine narrow floating-point data types with finer granularity per-block scaling factors. In turn, this enables both quantization of more tensors than previous approaches and more efficient execution of operations on those tensors.
  Effective use of MX-formats requires careful choices of various parameters. In this paper we review these choices and show how MXFP8-E4M3 datatype and a specific number conversion algorithm result in training sessions that match those carried out in BF16. We present results using models with up to 8B parameters, trained on high-quality datasets of up to 15T tokens.

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. Although current table-native ICL architectures are architecturally efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, their exclusive training on synthetic data limits their ability to fully leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular data. At the other end of the spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE benchmark. Code and model checkpoints are available at: https://github.com/SAP-samples/contexttab

Abstract: RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging from embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the RVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN. Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) seeks to recover closed-form mathematical expressions that describe observed data. While existing methods have advanced the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\mathbf{x})$) or discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves state-of-the-art recovery rates on the Nguyen and Feynman benchmark suites, an impressive recovery rate of 61\% on Nguyen-12 compared to the next best 2\%, and strong placement on the error-complexity Pareto fronts on the Feynman equations and on a subset of 57 SRBench Black-box problems. Our results demonstrate the power of structure-aware evolutionary search for scientific discovery. To support broader research in interpretable modeling and symbolic discovery, we have open-sourced the full SymMatika framework.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential. Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation (\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization (RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

Abstract: User activity sequences have emerged as one of the most important signals in recommender systems. We present a foundational model, PinFM, for understanding user activity sequences across multiple applications at a billion-scale visual discovery platform. We pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications, efficiently coupling it with existing models. While this pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as Vision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents numerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score millions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints imposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not present during the pretraining stage.
  We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on Pinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading to a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help improve the experience of more than a half billion users across various applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm [1], approached from a mixed-policy perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this, we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size. Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods, demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and exploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization.

Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG) technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study. We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency. Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) graph of the same size, spectral radius, and fixed density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG. An ER graph with density matched to the DyRC-VG can in some conditions outperform both approaches.

Abstract: We study a stochastic multi-armed bandit setting where arms are partitioned into known clusters, such that the mean rewards of arms within a cluster differ by at most a known threshold. While the clustering structure is known a priori, the arm means are unknown. We derive an asymptotic lower bound on the regret that improves upon the classical bound of Lai & Robbins (1985). We then propose Clus-UCB, an efficient algorithm that closely matches this lower bound asymptotically. Clus-UCB is designed to exploit the clustering structure and introduces a new index to evaluate an arm, which depends on other arms within the cluster. In this way, arms share information among each other. We present simulation results of our algorithm and compare its performance against KL-UCB and other wellknown algorithms for bandits with dependent arms. Finally, we address some limitations of this work and conclude by mentioning some possible future research.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient. We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model, FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to varying input sampling rates.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the absence of specific symptoms and reliable biomarkers. In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers. Our code is available at https://github.com/MosbahAouad/EarlyPDAC-MML.

Abstract: Using more test-time computation during language model inference, such as generating more intermediate thoughts or sampling multiple candidate answers, has proven effective in significantly improving model performance. This paper takes an initial step toward bridging the gap between practical language model inference and theoretical transformer analysis by incorporating randomness and sampling. We focus on in-context linear regression with continuous/binary coefficients, where our framework simulates language model decoding through noise injection and binary coefficient sampling. Through this framework, we provide detailed analyses of widely adopted inference techniques. Supported by empirical results, our theoretical framework and analysis demonstrate the potential for offering new insights into understanding inference behaviors in real-world language models.

Abstract: Load imbalance pervasively exists in distributed deep learning training systems, either caused by the inherent imbalance in learned tasks or by the system itself. Traditional synchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) achieves good accuracy for a wide variety of tasks, but relies on global synchronization to accumulate the gradients at every training step. In this paper, we propose eager-SGD, which relaxes the global synchronization for decentralized accumulation. To implement eager-SGD, we propose to use two partial collectives: solo and majority. With solo allreduce, the faster processes contribute their gradients eagerly without waiting for the slower processes, whereas with majority allreduce, at least half of the participants must contribute gradients before continuing, all without using a central parameter server. We theoretically prove the convergence of the algorithms and describe the partial collectives in detail. Experimental results on load-imbalanced environments (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and UCF101 datasets) show that eager-SGD achieves 1.27x speedup over the state-of-the-art synchronous SGD, without losing accuracy.

Abstract: Deep learning at scale is dominated by communication time. Distributing samples across nodes usually yields the best performance, but poses scaling challenges due to global information dissemination and load imbalance across uneven sample lengths. State-of-the-art decentralized optimizers mitigate the problem, but require more iterations to achieve the same accuracy as their globally-communicating counterparts. We present Wait-Avoiding Group Model Averaging (WAGMA) SGD, a wait-avoiding stochastic optimizer that reduces global communication via subgroup weight exchange. The key insight is a combination of algorithmic changes to the averaging scheme and the use of a group allreduce operation. We prove the convergence of WAGMA-SGD, and empirically show that it retains convergence rates similar to Allreduce-SGD. For evaluation, we train ResNet-50 on ImageNet; Transformer for machine translation; and deep reinforcement learning for navigation at scale. Compared with state-of-the-art decentralized SGD variants, WAGMA-SGD significantly improves training throughput (e.g., 2.1x on 1,024 GPUs for reinforcement learning), and achieves the fastest time-to-solution (e.g., the highest score using the shortest training time for Transformer).

Abstract: Training large deep learning models at scale is very challenging. This paper proposes Chimera, a novel pipeline parallelism scheme which combines bidirectional pipelines for efficiently training large-scale models. Chimera is a synchronous approach and therefore no loss of accuracy, which is more convergence-friendly than asynchronous approaches. Compared with the latest synchronous pipeline approach, Chimera reduces the number of bubbles by up to 50%; benefiting from the sophisticated scheduling of bidirectional pipelines, Chimera has a more balanced activation memory consumption. Evaluations are conducted on Transformer based language models. For a GPT-2 model with 1.3 billion parameters running on 2,048 GPU nodes of the Piz Daint supercomputer, Chimera improves the training throughput by 1.16x-2.34x over the state-of-the-art synchronous and asynchronous pipeline approaches.

Abstract: Designing efficient and accurate numerical solvers for high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a challenging and important topic in computational science and engineering, mainly due to the "curse of dimensionality" in designing numerical schemes that scale in dimension. This paper introduces a new methodology that seeks an approximate PDE solution in the space of functions with finitely many analytic expressions and, hence, this methodology is named the finite expression method (FEX). It is proved in approximation theory that FEX can avoid the curse of dimensionality. As a proof of concept, a deep reinforcement learning method is proposed to implement FEX for various high-dimensional PDEs in different dimensions, achieving high and even machine accuracy with a memory complexity polynomial in dimension and an amenable time complexity. An approximate solution with finite analytic expressions also provides interpretable insights into the ground truth PDE solution, which can further help to advance the understanding of physical systems and design postprocessing techniques for a refined solution.

Abstract: Clustering of time series is a well-studied problem, with applications ranging from quantitative, personalized models of metabolism obtained from metabolite concentrations to state discrimination in quantum information theory. We consider a variant, where given a set of trajectories and a number of parts, we jointly partition the set of trajectories and learn linear dynamical system (LDS) models for each part, so as to minimize the maximum error across all the models. We present globally convergent methods and EM heuristics, accompanied by promising computational results. The key highlight of this method is that it does not require a predefined hidden state dimension but instead provides an upper bound. Additionally, it offers guidance for determining regularization in the system identification.

Abstract: Deep learning enables automatic and robust extraction of cardiac function descriptors from echocardiographic sequences, such as ejection fraction or strain. These descriptors provide fine-grained information that physicians consider, in conjunction with more global variables from the clinical record, to assess patients' condition. Drawing on novel Transformer models applied to tabular data, we propose a method that considers all descriptors extracted from medical records and echocardiograms to learn the representation of a cardiovascular pathology with a difficult-to-characterize continuum, namely hypertension. Our method first projects each variable into its own representation space using modality-specific approaches. These standardized representations of multimodal data are then fed to a Transformer encoder, which learns to merge them into a comprehensive representation of the patient through the task of predicting a clinical rating. This stratification task is formulated as an ordinal classification to enforce a pathological continuum in the representation space. We observe the major trends along this continuum on a cohort of 239 hypertensive patients, providing unprecedented details in the description of hypertension's impact on various cardiac function descriptors. Our analysis shows that i) the XTab foundation model's architecture allows to reach outstanding performance (96.8% AUROC) even with limited data (less than 200 training samples), ii) stratification across the population is reproducible between trainings (within 5.7% mean absolute error), and iii) patterns emerge in descriptors, some of which align with established physiological knowledge about hypertension, while others could pave the way for a more comprehensive understanding of this pathology.

Abstract: We present the first algorithm for query learning Mealy machines with timers in a black-box context. Our algorithm is an extension of the L# algorithm of Vaandrager et al. to a timed setting. We rely on symbolic queries which empower us to reason on untimed executions while learning. Similarly to the algorithm for learning timed automata of Waga, these symbolic queries can be realized using finitely many concrete queries. Experiments with a prototype implementation show that our algorithm is able to efficiently learn realistic benchmarks.

Abstract: Electronic health record (EHR) systems contain a wealth of multimodal clinical data including structured data like clinical codes and unstructured data such as clinical notes. However, many existing EHR-focused studies has traditionally either concentrated on an individual modality or merged different modalities in a rather rudimentary fashion. This approach often results in the perception of structured and unstructured data as separate entities, neglecting the inherent synergy between them. Specifically, the two important modalities contain clinically relevant, inextricably linked and complementary health information. A more complete picture of a patient's medical history is captured by the joint analysis of the two modalities of data. Despite the great success of multimodal contrastive learning on vision-language, its potential remains under-explored in the realm of multimodal EHR, particularly in terms of its theoretical understanding. To accommodate the statistical analysis of multimodal EHR data, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal feature embedding generative model and design a multimodal contrastive loss to obtain the multimodal EHR feature representation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal learning compared to single-modality learning and connects the solution of the loss function to the singular value decomposition of a pointwise mutual information matrix. This connection paves the way for a privacy-preserving algorithm tailored for multimodal EHR feature representation learning. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithm performs well under a variety of configurations. We further validate the clinical utility of the proposed algorithm in real-world EHR data.

Abstract: In both observational data and randomized control trials, researchers select statistical models to articulate how the outcome of interest varies with combinations of observable covariates. Choosing a model that is too simple can obfuscate important heterogeneity in outcomes between covariate groups, while too much complexity risks identifying spurious patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian framework for model uncertainty called Rashomon Partition Sets (RPSs). The RPS consists of all models that have posterior density close to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) model. We construct the RPS by enumeration, rather than sampling, which ensures that we explore all models models with high evidence in the data, even if they offer dramatically different substantive explanations. We use a l0 prior, which allows the allows us to capture complex heterogeneity without imposing strong assumptions about the associations between effects, showing this prior is minimax optimal from an information-theoretic perspective. We characterize the approximation error of (functions of) parameters computed conditional on being in the RPS relative to the entire posterior. We propose an algorithm to enumerate the RPS from the class of models that are interpretable and unique, then provide bounds on the size of the RPS. We give simulation evidence along with three empirical examples: price effects on charitable giving, heterogeneity in chromosomal structure, and the introduction of microfinance.

Abstract: This paper introduces Interactive Tables (iTBLS), a dataset of interactive conversations that focuses on natural-language manipulation of tabular information sourced from academic pre-prints on ArXiv. The iTBLS dataset consists of three types of tabular tasks -- interpretation, modification, and generation. Interpretation focuses on tabular understanding, modification focuses on manipulating tabular information, and generation focuses on the addition of new natural-language evidence. In addition, the paper presents a novel framework that reformulates tabular operations as question-answering, where an appropriate question is formulated based on the nature of interaction and the question is answered using the user request as evidence. The developed approach results in an improvement on all tasks on a sequence-to-sequence modeling baseline on iTBLS. In addition, the question-answering-based reformulation is applied to datasets from prior work for the text-to-table task where textual paragraphs are summarized into tables. The novel approach results in up to 13% improvement in Exact-Match accuracy and up to 16% improvement in BERTScores compared to the prior state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Relevance and utility are two frequently used measures to evaluate the effectiveness of an information retrieval (IR) system. Relevance emphasizes the aboutness of a result to a query, while utility refers to the result's usefulness or value to an information seeker. In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), high-utility results should be prioritized to feed to LLMs due to their limited input bandwidth. Re-examining RAG's three core components -- relevance ranking derived from retrieval models, utility judgments, and answer generation -- aligns with Schutz's philosophical system of relevances, which encompasses three types of relevance representing different levels of human cognition that enhance each other. These three RAG components also reflect three cognitive levels for LLMs in question-answering. Therefore, we propose an Iterative utiliTy judgmEnt fraMework (ITEM) to promote each step in RAG. We conducted extensive experiments on retrieval (TREC DL, WebAP), utility judgment task (GTI-NQ), and factoid question-answering (NQ) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements of ITEM in utility judgments, ranking, and answer generation upon representative baselines.

Abstract: Convex programming plays a fundamental role in machine learning, data science, and engineering. Testing convexity structure in nonlinear programs relies on verifying the convexity of objectives and constraints. Grant et al. (2006) introduced a framework, Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP), for automating this verification task for a wide range of convex functions that can be decomposed into basic convex functions (atoms) using convexity-preserving compositions and transformations (rules). Here, we extend this framework to functions defined on manifolds with non-positive curvature (Hadamard manifolds) by introducing Disciplined Geodesically Convex Programming (DGCP). In particular, this allows for verifying a broader range of convexity notions. For instance, many notable instances of statistical estimators and matrix-valued (sub)routines in machine learning applications are Euclidean non-convex, but exhibit geodesic convexity through a more general Riemannian lens. To define the DGCP framework, we determine convexity-preserving compositions and transformations for geodesically convex functions on general Hadamard manifolds, as well as for the special case of symmetric positive definite matrices, a common setting in matrix-valued optimization. For the latter, we also define a basic set of atoms. Our paper is accompanied by a Julia package SymbolicAnalysis.jl, which provides functionality for testing and certifying DGCP-compliant expressions. Our library interfaces with manifold optimization software, which allows for directly solving verified geodesically convex programs.

Abstract: Reconstruction-based anomaly detection via denoising diffusion model has limitations in determining appropriate noise parameters that can degrade anomalies while preserving normal characteristics. Also, normal regions can fluctuate considerably during reconstruction, resulting in false detection. In this paper, we propose a method to detect anomalies by analysis of reconstruction trend depending on the degree of degradation, effectively solving the both problems that impede practical application in display inspection.

Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential tool in modern computer vision, allowing practitioners to leverage backbones, pretrained on large datasets, to train successful models from limited annotated data. Choosing the right backbone is crucial, especially for small datasets, since final performance depends heavily on the quality of the initial feature representations. While prior work has conducted benchmarks across various datasets to identify universal top-performing backbones, we demonstrate that backbone effectiveness is highly dataset-dependent, especially in low-data scenarios where no single backbone consistently excels. To overcome this limitation, we introduce dataset-specific backbone selection as a new research direction and investigate its practical viability in low-data regimes. Since exhaustive evaluation is computationally impractical for large backbone pools, we formalize Vision Backbone Efficient Selection (VIBES) as the problem of searching for high-performing backbones under computational constraints. We define the solution space, propose several heuristics, and demonstrate VIBES feasibility for low-data image classification by performing experiments on four diverse datasets. Our results show that even simple search strategies can find well-suited backbones within a pool of over $1300$ pretrained models, outperforming generic benchmark recommendations within just ten minutes of search time on a single GPU (NVIDIA RTX A5000).

Abstract: Reconstructing large-scale latent networks from observed dynamics is crucial for understanding complex systems. However, the existing methods based on compressive sensing are often rendered infeasible in practice by prohibitive computational and memory costs. To address this challenge, we introduce a new distributed computing framework for efficient large-scale network reconstruction with parallel computing, namely PALMS (Parallel Adaptive Lasso with Multi-directional Signals). The core idea of PALMS is to decompose the complex global problem by partitioning network nodes, enabling the parallel estimation of sub-networks across multiple computing units. This strategy substantially reduces the computational complexity and storage requirements of classic methods. By using the adaptive multi-directional regularization on each computing unit, we also establish the consistency of PALMS estimator theoretically. Extensive simulation studies and empirical analyses on several large-scale real-world networks validate the computational efficiency and robust reconstruction accuracy of our approach.

Abstract: Transformer-based pre-trained language models have dominated the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for quite some time now. However, the Nepali language, spoken by approximately 32 million people worldwide, remains significantly underrepresented in this domain. This underrepresentation is primarily attributed to the scarcity of monolingual data corpora and limited available resources for the Nepali language. While existing efforts have predominantly concentrated on basic encoder-based models, there is a notable gap in the exploration of decoder-based architectures. To address this gap, we have collected 27.5 GB of Nepali text data, approximately 2.4x larger than any previously available Nepali language corpus. Leveraging this data, we pre-trained three different models i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2, exclusively for the Nepali Language. Furthermore, we performed instruction tuning and explored its potential for monolingual Nepali data, providing a foundation for future research. Our models outperformed the existing best model by 2 points on Nep-gLUE benchmark, scoring 95.60 and also outperformed existing models on text generation tasks, demonstrating improvements in both understanding and generating Nepali text.

Abstract: The integration of tabular data from diverse sources is often hindered by inconsistencies in formatting and representation, posing significant challenges for data analysts and personal digital assistants. Existing methods for automating tabular data transformations are limited in scope, often focusing on specific types of transformations or lacking interpretability. In this paper, we introduce TabulaX, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-class column-level tabular transformations. TabulaX first classifies input columns into four transformation types (string-based, numerical, algorithmic, and general) and then applies tailored methods to generate human-interpretable transformation functions, such as numeric formulas or programming code. This approach enhances transparency and allows users to understand and modify the mappings. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets from various domains, we demonstrate that TabulaX outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, supports a broader class of transformations, and generates interpretable transformations that can be efficiently applied.

Abstract: The opioid crisis remains a critical public health challenge in the United States. Despite national efforts which reduced opioid prescribing rates by nearly 45\% between 2011 and 2021, opioid-related overdose deaths more than tripled during the same period. This alarming trend reflects a major shift in the crisis, with illegal opioids now driving the majority of overdose deaths instead of prescription opioids. Although much attention has been given to supply-side factors fueling this transition, the underlying structural conditions that perpetuate and exacerbate opioid misuse remain less understood. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic intensified the opioid crisis through widespread social isolation and record-high unemployment; consequently, understanding the underlying drivers of this epidemic has become even more crucial in recent years. To address this need, our study examines the correlation between opioid-related mortality and thirteen county-level characteristics related to population traits, economic stability, and infrastructure. Leveraging a nationwide county-level dataset spanning consecutive years from 2010 to 2022, this study integrates empirical insights from exploratory data analysis with feature importance metrics derived from machine learning models. Our findings highlight critical regional characteristics strongly correlated with opioid-related mortality, emphasizing their potential roles in worsening the epidemic when their levels are high and mitigating it when their levels are low.

<title>Spatially-guided Temporal Aggregation for Robust Event-RGB Optical Flow Estimation</title>

Abstract: Current optical flow methods exploit the stable appearance of frame (or RGB) data to establish robust correspondences across time. Event cameras, on the other hand, provide high-temporal-resolution motion cues and excel in challenging scenarios. These complementary characteristics underscore the potential of integrating frame and event data for optical flow estimation. However, most cross-modal approaches fail to fully utilize the complementary advantages, relying instead on simply stacking information. This study introduces a novel approach that uses a spatially dense modality to guide the aggregation of the temporally dense event modality, achieving effective cross-modal fusion. Specifically, we propose an event-enhanced frame representation that preserves the rich texture of frames and the basic structure of events. We use the enhanced representation as the guiding modality and employ events to capture temporally dense motion information. The robust motion features derived from the guiding modality direct the aggregation of motion information from events. To further enhance fusion, we propose a transformer-based module that complements sparse event motion features with spatially rich frame information and enhances global information propagation. Additionally, a mix-fusion encoder is designed to extract comprehensive spatiotemporal contextual features from both modalities. Extensive experiments on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Leveraging the complementary strengths of frames and events, our method achieves leading performance on the DSEC-Flow dataset. Compared to the event-only model, frame guidance improves accuracy by 10\%. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion-based method with a 4\% accuracy gain and a 45\% reduction in inference time.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial to advance autonomous driving, improving safety, and efficiency. Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the non-asymptotic validity of the multiplier bootstrap procedure for constructing the confidence sets using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. Under appropriate regularity conditions, our approach avoids the need to approximate the limiting covariance of Polyak-Ruppert SGD iterates, which allows us to derive approximation rates in convex distance of order up to $1/\sqrt{n}$. Notably, this rate can be faster than the one that can be proven in the Polyak-Juditsky central limit theorem. To our knowledge, this provides the first fully non-asymptotic bound on the accuracy of bootstrap approximations in SGD algorithms. Our analysis builds on the Gaussian approximation results for nonlinear statistics of independent random variables.

<title>Fact or Guesswork? Evaluating Large Language Models' Medical Knowledge with Structured One-Hop Judgments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14275</link>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in various downstream task domains. However, their abilities to directly recall and apply factual medical knowledge remains under-explored. Most existing medical QA benchmarks assess complex reasoning or multi-hop inference, making it difficult to isolate LLMs' inherent medical knowledge from their reasoning capabilities. Given the high-stakes nature of medical applications, where incorrect information can have critical consequences, it is essential to evaluate the factuality of LLMs to retain medical knowledge.
  To address this challenge, we introduce the Medical Knowledge Judgment Dataset (MKJ), a dataset derived from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), a comprehensive repository of standardized biomedical vocabularies and knowledge graphs. Through a binary classification framework, MKJ evaluates LLMs' grasp of fundamental medical facts by having them assess the validity of concise, one-hop statements, enabling direct measurement of their knowledge retention capabilities.
  Our experiments reveal that LLMs have difficulty accurately recalling medical facts, with performances varying substantially across semantic types and showing notable weakness in uncommon medical conditions. Furthermore, LLMs show poor calibration, often being overconfident in incorrect answers. To mitigate these issues, we explore retrieval-augmented generation, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving factual accuracy and reducing uncertainty in medical decision-making.

<title>Rectifying Conformity Scores for Better Conditional Coverage</title>

arXiv:2502.16336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for generating confidence sets within the split conformal prediction framework. Our method performs a trainable transformation of any given conformity score to improve conditional coverage while ensuring exact marginal coverage. The transformation is based on an estimate of the conditional quantile of conformity scores. The resulting method is particularly beneficial for constructing adaptive confidence sets in multi-output problems where standard conformal quantile regression approaches have limited applicability. We develop a theoretical bound that captures the influence of the accuracy of the quantile estimate on the approximate conditional validity, unlike classical bounds for conformal prediction methods that only offer marginal coverage. We experimentally show that our method is highly adaptive to the local data structure and outperforms existing methods in terms of conditional coverage, improving the reliability of statistical inference in various applications.

Abstract: Feature engineering for generalized seizure detection models remains a significant challenge. Recently proposed models show variable performance depending on the training data and remain ineffective at accurately distinguishing artifacts from seizure data. In this study, we propose a novel end-to-end model, "Multiresolutional EEGWaveNet (MR-EEGWaveNet)," which efficiently distinguishes seizure events from background electroencephalogram (EEG) and artifacts/noise by capturing both temporal dependencies across different time frames and spatial relationships between channels. The model has three modules: convolution, feature extraction, and predictor. The convolution module extracts features through depth-wise and spatio-temporal convolution. The feature extraction module individually reduces the feature dimension extracted from EEG segments and their sub-segments. Subsequently, the extracted features are concatenated into a single vector for classification using a fully connected classifier called the predictor module. In addition, an anomaly score-based post-classification processing technique is introduced to reduce the false-positive rates of the model. Experimental results are reported and analyzed using different parameter settings and datasets (Siena (public) and Juntendo (private)). The proposed MR-EEGWaveNet significantly outperformed the conventional non-multiresolution approach, improving the F1 scores from 0.177 to 0.336 on Siena and 0.327 to 0.488 on Juntendo, with precision gains of 15.9% and 20.62%, respectively.

Abstract: The growth and characterization of materials using empirical optimization typically requires a significant amount of expert time, experience, and resources. Several complementary characterization methods are routinely performed to determine the quality and properties of a grown sample. Machine learning (ML) can support the conventional approaches by using historical data to guide and provide speed and efficiency to the growth and characterization of materials. Specifically, ML can provide quantitative information from characterization data that is typically obtained from a different modality. In this study, we have investigated the feasibility of projecting the quantitative metric from microscopy measurements, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), using data obtained from spectroscopy measurements, like Raman spectroscopy. Generative models were also trained to generate the full and specific features of the Raman and photoluminescence spectra from each other and the AFM images of the thin film MoS$_2$. The results are promising and have provided a foundational guide for the use of ML for the cross-modal characterization of materials for their accelerated, efficient, and cost-effective discovery.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI collaboration.

<title>Efficient Network Automatic Relevance Determination</title>

arXiv:2506.12352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Network Automatic Relevance Determination (NARD), an extension of ARD for linearly probabilistic models, to simultaneously model sparse relationships between inputs $X \in \mathbb R^{d \times N}$ and outputs $Y \in \mathbb R^{m \times N}$, while capturing the correlation structure among the $Y$. NARD employs a matrix normal prior which contains a sparsity-inducing parameter to identify and discard irrelevant features, thereby promoting sparsity in the model. Algorithmically, it iteratively updates both the precision matrix and the relationship between $Y$ and the refined inputs. To mitigate the computational inefficiencies of the $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^3)$ cost per iteration, we introduce Sequential NARD, which evaluates features sequentially, and a Surrogate Function Method, leveraging an efficient approximation of the marginal likelihood and simplifying the calculation of determinant and inverse of an intermediate matrix. Combining the Sequential update with the Surrogate Function method further reduces computational costs. The computational complexity per iteration for these three methods is reduced to $\mathcal O(m^3+p^3)$, $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^2)$, $\mathcal O(m^3+p^2)$, respectively, where $p \ll d$ is the final number of features in the model. Our methods demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency with comparable performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Data scientists often formulate predictive modeling tasks involving fuzzy, hard-to-define concepts, such as the "authenticity" of student writing or the "healthcare need" of a patient. Yet the process by which data scientists translate fuzzy concepts into a concrete, proxy target variable remains poorly understood. We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and healthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for predictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct target variables through a bricolage process, in which they use creative and pragmatic approaches to make do with the limited data at hand. Data scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable through bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and resource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively apply problem (re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable for another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g., predictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable to capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings, we present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better support the art and science of target variable construction.

Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other degradation issues. Code and generated data are available at https://github.com/528why/Dataset-Condensation-with-Color-Compensation.

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific scenario and make comparisons.

Summary:<br />
The paper addresses a scheduling problem in a remote inference system with multiple modalities using a multimodal machine learning model. The focus is on minimizing inference error by considering the Age of Information (AoI) vector of the modalities. An index-based threshold policy is proposed and proven to be optimal, involving switching modalities based on predetermined thresholds. The policy efficiently computes index functions and thresholds for general AoI functions and varying transmission times. Numerical experiments on robot state prediction demonstrate the policy's effectiveness, reducing inference error significantly compared to round-robin and random policies. This research highlights the importance of task-oriented AoI functions in optimizing real-time inference tasks in remote sensing systems.

Abstract: We consider a remote inference system with multiple modalities, where a multimodal machine learning (ML) model performs real-time inference using features collected from remote sensors. When sensor observations evolve dynamically over time, fresh features are critical for inference tasks. However, timely delivery of features from all modalities is often infeasible because of limited network resources. Towards this end, in this paper, we study a two-modality scheduling problem that seeks to minimize the ML model's inference error, expressed as a penalty function of the Age of Information (AoI) vector of the two modalities. We develop an index-based threshold policy and prove its optimality. Specifically, the scheduler switches to the other modality once the current modality's index function exceeds a predetermined threshold. We show that both modalities share the same threshold and that the index functions and the threshold can be computed efficiently. Our optimality results hold for general AoI functions (which could be non-monotonic and non-separable) and heterogeneous transmission times across modalities. To demonstrate the importance of considering a task-oriented AoI function, we conduct numerical experiments based on robot state prediction and compare our policy with round-robin and uniform random policies (both are oblivious to the AoI and the inference error).n The results show that our policy reduces inference error by up to 55% compared with these baselines.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for training large language models and multimodal systems. Despite the notable advances enabled by existing RLHF training frameworks, significant challenges remain to scale to complex multimodal workflows and adapt to dynamic workloads. In particular, current systems often encounter limitations related to controller scalability when managing large models, as well as inefficiencies in orchestrating intricate RLHF pipelines, especially in scenarios that require dynamic sampling and resource allocation. In this paper, we introduce WeChat-YATT Yet Another Transformer Trainer in WeChat, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework specifically designed to address these challenges. WeChat-YATT features a parallel controller programming model that enables flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows, effectively mitigating bottlenecks associated with centralized controller architectures and facilitating scalability in large-scale data scenarios. In addition, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions computational resources and schedules workloads, thereby significantly reducing hardware idle time and improving GPU utilization under variable training conditions. We evaluate WeChat-YATT across diverse experimental scenarios, demonstrating its substantial throughput improvements over state-of-the-art RLHF training frameworks. Furthermore, WeChat-YATT has been successfully deployed to train models that support WeChat product features for a large-scale user base, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in real-world applications.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Large language models often face challenges with cost efficiency in long-sequence inference. One approach to improve efficiency is by reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache. However, current techniques are limited to single-context scenarios with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents are unknown beforehand, existing methods are ineffective due to the lack of cross-attention between contexts. The paper introduces SamKV, a method that explores attention sparsification for multiple-context KV Cache. By considering the information of other contexts when sparsifying one context and locally recomputing the sparsified information, SamKV can compress sequence length to 15% without accuracy degradation, boosting throughput significantly in multi-context RAG scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Large language models face significant cost challenges in long-sequence inference. To address this, reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache for improved inference efficiency has become a mainstream approach. Recent advances further enhance throughput by sparse attention mechanisms to select the most relevant KV Cache, thereby reducing sequence length. However, such techniques are limited to single-context scenarios, where historical KV Cache is computed sequentially with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents as context are unknown beforehand, each document's KV Cache is computed and stored independently (termed multiple-context KV Cache), lacking cross-attention between contexts. This renders existing methods ineffective. Although prior work partially recomputes multiple-context KV Cache to mitigate accuracy loss from missing cross-attention, it requires retaining all KV Cache throughout, failing to reduce memory overhead. This paper presents SamKV, the first exploration of attention sparsification for multiple-context KV Cache. Specifically, SamKV takes into account the complementary information of other contexts when sparsifying one context, and then locally recomputes the sparsified information. Experiments demonstrate that our method compresses sequence length to 15% without accuracy degradation compared with full-recompuation baselines, significantly boosting throughput in multi-context RAG scenarios.

<div> adversarial text attacks, transformer models, defense, Representation Stability, embedding sensitivity <br />
Summary: 
Adversarial text attacks pose a persistent threat to transformer models, and current defenses are often specific to certain attacks or require costly retraining. A new model-agnostic detection framework called Representation Stability (RS) is introduced, which identifies adversarial examples by measuring changes in embedding representations when important words are masked. RS ranks words based on importance, measures embedding sensitivity to masking top-k critical words, and uses a BiLSTM detector to process the patterns. Experiments show that perturbed words have higher masking sensitivity compared to naturally important words. RS achieves over 88% detection accuracy across multiple datasets, attack types, and victim models. It performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods at lower computational cost and shows improved performance with gradient-based word ranking. RS generalizes well to unseen datasets, attacks, and models without retraining, offering a practical solution for adversarial text detection. <div>

Abstract: Adversarial text attacks remain a persistent threat to transformer models, yet existing defenses are typically attack-specific or require costly model retraining. We introduce Representation Stability (RS), a model-agnostic detection framework that identifies adversarial examples by measuring how embedding representations change when important words are masked. RS first ranks words using importance heuristics, then measures embedding sensitivity to masking top-k critical words, and processes the resulting patterns with a BiLSTM detector. Experiments show that adversarially perturbed words exhibit disproportionately high masking sensitivity compared to naturally important words. Across three datasets, three attack types, and two victim models, RS achieves over 88% detection accuracy and demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, often at lower computational cost. Using Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) to measure perturbation identification quality, we reveal that gradient-based ranking outperforms attention and random selection approaches, with identification quality correlating with detection performance for word-level attacks. RS also generalizes well to unseen datasets, attacks, and models without retraining, providing a practical solution for adversarial text detection.

Summary:
The study introduces a lightweight sInvResUNet model and a collaborative learning scheme named KDCL_sInvResUNet for noninvasive arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring. With minimal parameters and computational load, real-time ABP estimation was successfully achieved on embedded devices. Subject-independent validation in a large perioperative dataset demonstrated better performance compared to larger models, with a mean absolute error of 10.06 mmHg and a mean Pearson correlation of 0.88 in tracking ABP changes. However, deep learning models showed significant performance variations across different demographic and cardiovascular conditions, limiting their ability to generalize across a diverse population. This research paves the way for unobtrusive ABP monitoring in real-world perioperative settings, setting a foundation for future advancements in the field.

Abstract: Noninvasive arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring is essential for patient management in critical care and perioperative settings, providing continuous assessment of cardiovascular hemodynamics with minimal risks. Numerous deep learning models have developed to reconstruct ABP waveform from noninvasively acquired physiological signals such as electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram. However, limited research has addressed the issue of model performance and computational load for deployment on embedded systems. The study introduces a lightweight sInvResUNet, along with a collaborative learning scheme named KDCL_sInvResUNet. With only 0.89 million parameters and a computational load of 0.02 GFLOPS, real-time ABP estimation was successfully achieved on embedded devices with an inference time of just 8.49 milliseconds for a 10-second output. We performed subject-independent validation in a large-scale and heterogeneous perioperative dataset containing 1,257,141 data segments from 2,154 patients, with a wide BP range (41-257 mmHg for SBP, and 31-234 mmHg for DBP). The proposed KDCL_sInvResUNet achieved lightly better performance compared to large models, with a mean absolute error of 10.06 mmHg and mean Pearson correlation of 0.88 in tracking ABP changes. Despite these promising results, all deep learning models showed significant performance variations across different demographic and cardiovascular conditions, highlighting their limited ability to generalize across such a broad and diverse population. This study lays a foundation work for real-time, unobtrusive ABP monitoring in real-world perioperative settings, providing baseline for future advancements in this area.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Biomedical Image Incremental Learning, Modality-Specific LoRA modules, Contrastive Regularization, knowledge preservation, knowledge sharing

Summary:
MSLoRA-CR addresses the challenges of Multimodal Biomedical Image Incremental Learning by proposing a method that fine-tunes Modality-Specific LoRA modules while incorporating Contrastive Regularization. This approach helps in preserving previously learned knowledge during incremental updates and effectively leveraging knowledge from existing modalities to support new ones. The method builds upon a large vision-language model, keeping the pretrained model frozen while adapting new LoRA modules for each modality or task. Experimental results show that MSLoRA-CR outperforms current approaches, achieving a 1.88% improvement in overall performance compared to unconstrained incremental learning methods while maintaining computational efficiency. The code for MSLoRA-CR is publicly available on GitHub, providing a valuable resource for researchers in the biomedical domain. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Biomedical Image Incremental Learning (MBIIL) is essential for handling diverse tasks and modalities in the biomedical domain, as training separate models for each modality or task significantly increases inference costs. Existing incremental learning methods focus on task expansion within a single modality, whereas MBIIL seeks to train a unified model incrementally across modalities. The MBIIL faces two challenges: I) How to preserve previously learned knowledge during incremental updates? II) How to effectively leverage knowledge acquired from existing modalities to support new modalities? To address these challenges, we propose MSLoRA-CR, a method that fine-tunes Modality-Specific LoRA modules while incorporating Contrastive Regularization to enhance intra-modality knowledge sharing and promote inter-modality knowledge differentiation. Our approach builds upon a large vision-language model (LVLM), keeping the pretrained model frozen while incrementally adapting new LoRA modules for each modality or task. Experiments on the incremental learning of biomedical images demonstrate that MSLoRA-CR outperforms both the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach of training separate models for each modality and the general incremental learning method (incrementally fine-tuning LoRA). Specifically, MSLoRA-CR achieves a 1.88% improvement in overall performance compared to unconstrained incremental learning methods while maintaining computational efficiency. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/VentusAislant/MSLoRA_CR.

<div> Keywords: deep learning, vehicle routing problems, lifelong learning, Transformer network, context scheduler<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a novel lifelong learning framework for training a neural solver to handle vehicle routing problems (VRPs) in diverse contexts. The framework, called a lifelong learner (LL), utilizes a Transformer network to solve a series of VRPs. An inter-context self-attention mechanism is proposed within LL to transfer knowledge from solving previous VRPs to new ones. Additionally, a dynamic context scheduler (DCS) with cross-context experience replay is developed to help LL learn from past policies. Experimental results on synthetic and benchmark instances demonstrate that the LL framework is effective in discovering policies for solving various VRPs and outperforms other neural solvers. The framework shows promising results across different VRP scenarios, achieving the best performance for most VRPs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has been extensively explored to solve vehicle routing problems (VRPs), which yields a range of data-driven neural solvers with promising outcomes. However, most neural solvers are trained to tackle VRP instances in a relatively monotonous context, e.g., simplifying VRPs by using Euclidean distance between nodes and adhering to a single problem size, which harms their off-the-shelf application in different scenarios. To enhance their versatility, this paper presents a novel lifelong learning framework that incrementally trains a neural solver to manage VRPs in distinct contexts. Specifically, we propose a lifelong learner (LL), exploiting a Transformer network as the backbone, to solve a series of VRPs. The inter-context self-attention mechanism is proposed within LL to transfer the knowledge obtained from solving preceding VRPs into the succeeding ones. On top of that, we develop a dynamic context scheduler (DCS), employing the cross-context experience replay to further facilitate LL looking back on the attained policies of solving preceding VRPs. Extensive results on synthetic and benchmark instances (problem sizes up to 18k) show that our LL is capable of discovering effective policies for tackling generic VRPs in varying contexts, which outperforms other neural solvers and achieves the best performance for most VRPs.

Abstract: Demographic shifts, influenced by globalization, economic conditions, geopolitical events, and environmental factors, pose significant challenges for policymakers and researchers. Accurate demographic forecasting is essential for informed decision-making in areas such as urban planning, healthcare, and economic policy. This study explores the application of time series foundation models to predict demographic changes in the United States using datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). We evaluate the performance of the Time Series Foundation Model (TimesFM) against traditional baselines including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Linear Regression. Our experiments across six demographically diverse states demonstrate that TimesFM achieves the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) in 86.67% of test cases, with particularly strong performance on minority populations with sparse historical data. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained foundation models to enhance demographic analysis and inform proactive policy interventions without requiring extensive task-specific fine-tuning.

Summary:<br /><br />The article introduces the Site Planning Layout Indicator (SPLI) system, a data-driven framework that integrates various sources of data to analyze urban spatial layouts. The system includes dimensions such as hierarchical building function classification, spatial organization patterns, functional diversity measurements, accessibility to essential services, and land use intensity assessments. By combining OpenStreetMap, Points of Interest, building morphology, land use, and satellite imagery, the SPLI system addresses data gaps through deep learning techniques like Relational Graph Neural Networks and Graph Neural Networks.

Abstract: The spatial layout of urban sites shapes land-use efficiency and spatial organization. Traditional site planning often relies on experiential judgment and single-source data, limiting systematic quantification of multifunctional layouts. We propose a Site Planning Layout Indicator (SPLI) system, a data-driven framework integrating empirical knowledge with heterogeneous multi-source data to produce structured urban spatial information. The SPLI supports multimodal spatial data systems for analytics, inference, and retrieval by combining OpenStreetMap (OSM), Points of Interest (POI), building morphology, land use, and satellite imagery. It extends conventional metrics through five dimensions: (1) Hierarchical Building Function Classification, refining empirical systems into clear hierarchies; (2) Spatial Organization, quantifying seven layout patterns (e.g., symmetrical, concentric, axial-oriented); (3) Functional Diversity, transforming qualitative assessments into measurable indicators using Functional Ratio (FR) and Simpson Index (SI); (4) Accessibility to Essential Services, integrating facility distribution and transport networks for comprehensive accessibility metrics; and (5) Land Use Intensity, using Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and Building Coverage Ratio (BCR) to assess utilization efficiency. Data gaps are addressed through deep learning, including Relational Graph Neural Networks (RGNN) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Experiments show the SPLI improves functional classification accuracy and provides a standardized basis for automated, data-driven urban spatial analytics.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a new approach for modeling temporal dependencies and event-driven interactions in complex systems using the multivariate Hawkes process. The focus is on uncovering causal structures among observed and latent subprocesses in partially observed real-world systems. The authors show that continuous-time event sequences can be effectively represented by a discrete-time model as time intervals shrink. They propose a two-phase iterative algorithm to infer causal relationships among discovered subprocesses and identify new latent subprocesses. The algorithm is guided by path-based conditions that ensure identifiability. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the method's ability to recover causal structures even in the presence of latent subprocesses. <div>

Abstract: Multivariate Hawkes process provides a powerful framework for modeling temporal dependencies and event-driven interactions in complex systems. While existing methods primarily focus on uncovering causal structures among observed subprocesses, real-world systems are often only partially observed, with latent subprocesses posing significant challenges. In this paper, we show that continuous-time event sequences can be represented by a discrete-time model as the time interval shrinks, and we leverage this insight to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying latent subprocesses and the causal influences. Accordingly, we propose a two-phase iterative algorithm that alternates between inferring causal relationships among discovered subprocesses and uncovering new latent subprocesses, guided by path-based conditions that guarantee identifiability. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method effectively recovers causal structures despite the presence of latent subprocesses.

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel BRain-Inspired feature Fusion (BRIEF) framework for automatic determination of network architecture and feature space fusion in functional MRI-based classification of mental disorders. It incorporates a neural network connection search strategy and a Transformer-based multi-feature fusion module. The framework extracts four types of fMRI temporal representations and employs Q-learning to optimize network connections. A Transformer is used for feature fusion, considering stable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies. An attention module enhances interpretability. BRIEF outperformed 21 state-of-the-art models in discriminating schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder from healthy controls, achieving AUCs of 91.5% and 78.4%, respectively. This innovative approach showcases the potential of incorporating brain-inspired, reinforcement learning strategies in fMRI-based classification, offering promise for the identification of precise neuroimaging biomarkers.

Abstract: Existing deep learning models for functional MRI-based classification have limitations in network architecture determination (relying on experience) and feature space fusion (mostly simple concatenation, lacking mutual learning). Inspired by the human brain's mechanism of updating neural connections through learning and decision-making, we proposed a novel BRain-Inspired feature Fusion (BRIEF) framework, which is able to optimize network architecture automatically by incorporating an improved neural network connection search (NCS) strategy and a Transformer-based multi-feature fusion module. Specifically, we first extracted 4 types of fMRI temporal representations, i.e., time series (TCs), static/dynamic functional connection (FNC/dFNC), and multi-scale dispersion entropy (MsDE), to construct four encoders. Within each encoder, we employed a modified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level feature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process. Then, all feature vectors were fused via a Transformer, leveraging both stable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies across different brain regions to achieve the final classification. Additionally, an attention module was embedded to improve interpretability. The classification performance of our proposed BRIEF was compared with 21 state-of-the-art models by discriminating two mental disorders from healthy controls: schizophrenia (SZ, n=1100) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=1550). BRIEF demonstrated significant improvements of 2.2% to 12.1% compared to 21 algorithms, reaching an AUC of 91.5% - 0.6% for SZ and 78.4% - 0.5% for ASD, respectively. This is the first attempt to incorporate a brain-inspired, reinforcement learning strategy to optimize fMRI-based mental disorder classification, showing significant potential for identifying precise neuroimaging biomarkers.

A case study focused on extending LANDFIRE's Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) dataset from the USA to Canada is presented. The qualitative analysis shows that model predictions align well with ground truth for EVT classifications. Despite limitations, the trained models achieve high classification accuracies of 81% and 73% on EVT validation sets in the USA and Canada respectively. This approach showcases the potential for using AEF to enhance geospatial datasets on a global scale, contributing to better insights and understanding of our planet's geography. <br />  <div>

Abstract: High-quality labeled geospatial datasets are essential for extracting insights and understanding our planet. Unfortunately, these datasets often do not span the entire globe and are limited to certain geographic regions where data was collected. Google DeepMind's recently released AlphaEarth Foundations (AEF) provides an information-dense global geospatial representation designed to serve as a useful input across a wide gamut of tasks. In this article we propose and evaluate a methodology which leverages AEF to extend geospatial labeled datasets beyond their initial geographic regions. We show that even basic models like random forests or logistic regression can be used to accomplish this task. We investigate a case study of extending LANDFIRE's Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) dataset beyond the USA into Canada at two levels of granularity: EvtPhys (13 classes) and EvtGp (80 classes). Qualitatively, for EvtPhys, model predictions align with ground truth. Trained models achieve 81% and 73% classification accuracy on EvtPhys validation sets in the USA and Canada, despite discussed limitations.

Abstract: Real-time fault classification in resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices is critical for industrial safety, yet training robust models in such heterogeneous environments remains a significant challenge. Standard Federated Learning (FL) often fails in the presence of non-IID data, leading to model divergence. This paper introduces Fed-Meta-Align, a novel four-phase framework designed to overcome these limitations through a sophisticated initialization and training pipeline. Our process begins by training a foundational model on a general public dataset to establish a competent starting point. This model then undergoes a serial meta-initialization phase, where it sequentially trains on a subset of IOT Device data to learn a heterogeneity-aware initialization that is already situated in a favorable region of the loss landscape. This informed model is subsequently refined in a parallel FL phase, which utilizes a dual-criterion aggregation mechanism that weights for IOT devices updates based on both local performance and cosine similarity alignment. Finally, an on-device personalization phase adapts the converged global model into a specialized expert for each IOT Device. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Fed-Meta-Align achieves an average test accuracy of 91.27% across heterogeneous IOT devices, outperforming personalized FedAvg and FedProx by up to 3.87% and 3.37% on electrical and mechanical fault datasets, respectively. This multi-stage approach of sequenced initialization and adaptive aggregation provides a robust pathway for deploying high-performance intelligence on diverse TinyML networks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven remarkably effective at improving the accuracy of language models in verifiable and deterministic domains like mathematics. Here, we examine if current RL methods are also effective at optimizing language models in verifiable domains with stochastic outcomes, like scientific experiments. Through applications to synthetic data and real-world biological experiments, we demonstrate that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) induces overconfident probability predictions for binary stochastic outcomes, while Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and REINFORCE Leave-One-Out (RLOO) yield well-calibrated models. We show that removing group standard normalization in GRPO fixes its miscalibration and provide a theoretical explanation for why normalization causes overconfidence. Our results provide new evidence against the use of standard normalization in GRPO and help pave the way for applications of RL for reasoning language models beyond deterministic domains.

Abstract: Generating synthetic data is crucial in privacy-sensitive, data-scarce settings, especially for tabular datasets widely used in real-world applications. A key challenge is improving counterfactual and causal fairness, while preserving high utility. We present FairTabGen, a fairness-aware large language model-based framework for tabular synthetic data generation. We integrate multiple fairness definitions including counterfactual and causal fairness into both its generation and evaluation pipelines. We use in-context learning, prompt refinement, and fairness-aware data curation to balance fairness and utility. Across diverse datasets, our method outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods, achieving up to 10% improvements on fairness metrics such as demographic parity and path-specific causal effects while retaining statistical utility. Remarkably, it achieves these gains using less than 20% of the original data, highlighting its efficiency in low-data regimes. These results demonstrate a principled and practical approach for generating fair and useful synthetic tabular data.

The paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the computational efficiency of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) by utilizing fast functions like ReLU and trigonometric functions as basis components. This departure from traditional polynomial functions like B-splines and RBFs aims to improve performance on GPU devices and make the network structure more efficient. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed function combinations maintain competitive performance levels while potentially reducing training time and enhancing generalization capabilities.

arXiv:2508.11876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For years, many neural networks have been developed based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem (KART), which was created to address Hilbert's 13th problem. Recently, relying on KART, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have attracted attention from the research community, stimulating the use of polynomial functions such as B-splines and RBFs. However, these functions are not fully supported by GPU devices and are still considered less popular. In this paper, we propose the use of fast computational functions, such as ReLU and trigonometric functions (e.g., ReLU, sin, cos, arctan), as basis components in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). By integrating these function combinations into the network structure, we aim to enhance computational efficiency.

Summary:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for classification tasks, with visualization techniques like Grad-CAM enabling them to be understood as white-box methods.
- Incorporating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and/or Support Vector Machine (SVM) layers into CNNs can enhance classification performance, especially with limited training samples.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an effective approach for classification tasks, particularly when the training dataset is large. Although CNNs have long been considered a black-box classification method, they can be used as a white-box method through visualization techniques such as Grad-CAM. When training samples are limited, incorporating a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) layer and/or a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier into a CNN can effectively improve classification performance. However, traditional Grad-CAM cannot be directly applied to PCA and/or SVM layers. It is important to generate attention regions for PCA and/or SVM layers in CNNs to facilitate the development of white-box methods. Therefore, we propose ``PCA-Grad-CAM'', a method for visualizing attention regions in PCA feature vectors, and ``SVM-Grad-CAM'', a method for visualizing attention regions in an SVM classifier layer. To complete our methods analytically, it is necessary to solve the closed-form Jacobian consisting of partial derivatives from the last convolutional layer to the PCA and/or SVM layers. In this paper, we present the exact closed-form Jacobian and the visualization results of our methods applied to several major datasets.

<div> Keywords: linear recurrent models, scanning strategies, attention-hybrid architectures, high-order sliding window attention, Efficient N-dimensional Attention

Summary:
Linear recurrent models designed for language modeling can be extended to efficiently model long sequences of high-order data. The study examines scanning strategies and attention-hybrid architectures, finding that while scanning has limited benefits, attention-hybrid models show promising results. The use of tiled high-order sliding window attention in the form of Efficient N-dimensional Attention (ENA) is proposed and evaluated for its effectiveness. ENA combines linear recurrence for global information compression with high-order sliding window attention for local modeling, offering a practical solution for ultra-long high-order data modeling. The empirical experiments conducted demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the ENA framework. Overall, the study provides insights into enhancing the modeling of high-order data sequences by combining linear recurrence and attention mechanisms. 

Summary: <br /><br />Linear recurrent models can efficiently model long sequences of high-order data by utilizing attention-hybrid architectures. Tiled high-order sliding window attention is proposed as an effective approach in the form of Efficient N-dimensional Attention (ENA), which combines global information compression and local modeling. Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ENA in ultra-long high-order data modeling, offering a promising solution for efficient data processing. <div>
arXiv:2508.11921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient modeling of long sequences of high-order data requires a more efficient architecture than Transformer. In this paper, we investigate two key aspects of extending linear recurrent models, especially those originally designed for language modeling, to high-order data (1D to ND): scanning strategies and attention-hybrid architectures. Empirical results suggest that scanning provides limited benefits, while attention-hybrid models yield promising results. Focusing on the latter, we further evaluate types of attention and find that tiled high-order sliding window attention (SWA) is efficient in both theory and practice. We term the resulting hybrid architecture of linear recurrence and high-order SWA as Efficient N-dimensional Attention (ENA). We then conduct several experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. The intuition behind ENA is that linear recurrence compresses global information into a state, while SWA complements it by enforcing strict local modeling. Together, they form a simple framework that offers a promising and practical solution for ultra-long high-order data modeling.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Traditional methods for long-term traffic emission forecasting face challenges due to error amplification from multi-scale dependencies. The Scale-Disentangled Spatio-Temporal Modeling (SDSTM) framework addresses this by leveraging predictability differences across scales. It uses a dual-stream feature decomposition strategy based on the Koopman lifting operator to separate and fuse features at different scales while ensuring independence and complementarity. A novel fusion mechanism with a dual-stream independence constraint refines predictions, suppresses interference, and improves accuracy. Experimental results on a road-level traffic emission dataset in Xi'an demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. <div>

Abstract: Long-term traffic emission forecasting is crucial for the comprehensive management of urban air pollution. Traditional forecasting methods typically construct spatiotemporal graph models by mining spatiotemporal dependencies to predict emissions. However, due to the multi-scale entanglement of traffic emissions across time and space, these spatiotemporal graph modeling method tend to suffer from cascading error amplification during long-term inference. To address this issue, we propose a Scale-Disentangled Spatio-Temporal Modeling (SDSTM) framework for long-term traffic emission forecasting. It leverages the predictability differences across multiple scales to decompose and fuse features at different scales, while constraining them to remain independent yet complementary. Specifically, the model first introduces a dual-stream feature decomposition strategy based on the Koopman lifting operator. It lifts the scale-coupled spatiotemporal dynamical system into an infinite-dimensional linear space via Koopman operator, and delineates the predictability boundary using gated wavelet decomposition. Then a novel fusion mechanism is constructed, incorporating a dual-stream independence constraint based on cross-term loss to dynamically refine the dual-stream prediction results, suppress mutual interference, and enhance the accuracy of long-term traffic emission prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on a road-level traffic emission dataset within Xi'an's Second Ring Road demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<div> algorithm, linear contextual bandits, adversarial losses, stochastic action sets, regret<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces an algorithm for linear contextual bandits with adversarial losses and stochastic action sets. The algorithm efficiently addresses this problem by reducing it to misspecification-robust adversarial linear bandits with fixed action sets, achieving regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(\min\{d^2\sqrt{T}, \sqrt{d^3T\log K}\})$. Notably, it resolves an open question by Liu et al. (2023) by achieving $\text{poly}(d)\sqrt{T}$ regret in polynomial time, independent of the number of actions. For combinatorial bandits with adversarial losses and stochastic action sets described by a polynomial number of linear constraints, the algorithm stands out as the first to achieve $\text{poly}(d)\sqrt{T}$ regret in polynomial time. When a context simulator is available, the algorithm further improves its regret bound to $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{L^\star})$, where $L^\star$ represents the cumulative loss of the best policy. <div>

Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm for linear contextual bandits with adversarial losses and stochastic action sets. Our approach reduces this setting to misspecification-robust adversarial linear bandits with fixed action sets. Without knowledge of the context distribution or access to a context simulator, the algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(\min\{d^2\sqrt{T}, \sqrt{d^3T\log K}\})$ regret and runs in $\text{poly}(d,C,T)$ time, where $d$ is the feature dimension, $C$ is an upper bound on the number of linear constraints defining the action set in each round, $K$ is an upper bound on the number of actions in each round, and $T$ is number of rounds. This resolves the open question by Liu et al. (2023) on whether one can obtain $\text{poly}(d)\sqrt{T}$ regret in polynomial time independent of the number of actions. For the important class of combinatorial bandits with adversarial losses and stochastic action sets where the action sets can be described by a polynomial number of linear constraints, our algorithm is the first to achieve $\text{poly}(d)\sqrt{T}$ regret in polynomial time, while no prior algorithm achieves even $o(T)$ regret in polynomial time to our knowledge. When a simulator is available, the regret bound can be improved to $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{L^\star})$, where $L^\star$ is the cumulative loss of the best policy.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a critical challenge for modern machine learning systems, particularly as they increasingly operate in multimodal settings involving inputs like video, audio, and sensor data. Currently, many OOD detection methods have been proposed, each with different designs targeting various distribution shifts. A single OOD detector may not prevail across all the scenarios; therefore, how can we automatically select an ideal OOD detection model for different distribution shifts? Due to the inherent unsupervised nature of the OOD detection task, it is difficult to predict model performance and find a universally Best model. Also, systematically comparing models on the new unseen data is costly or even impractical. To address this challenge, we introduce M3OOD, a meta-learning-based framework for OOD detector selection in multimodal settings. Meta learning offers a solution by learning from historical model behaviors, enabling rapid adaptation to new data distribution shifts with minimal supervision. Our approach combines multimodal embeddings with handcrafted meta-features that capture distributional and cross-modal characteristics to represent datasets. By leveraging historical performance across diverse multimodal benchmarks, M3OOD can recommend suitable detectors for a new data distribution shift. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that M3OOD consistently outperforms 10 competitive baselines across 12 test scenarios with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Analog Compute-In-Memory (CIM) architectures promise significant energy efficiency gains for neural network inference, but suffer from complex hardware-induced noise that poses major challenges for deployment. While noise-aware training methods have been proposed to address this issue, they typically rely on idealized and differentiable noise models that fail to capture the full complexity of analog CIM hardware variations. Motivated by the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) framework in quantization, we decouple forward noise simulation from backward gradient computation, enabling noise-aware training with more accurate but computationally intractable noise modeling in analog CIM systems. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach preserves essential gradient directional information while maintaining computational tractability and optimization stability. Extensive experiments show that our extended STE framework achieves up to 5.3% accuracy improvement on image classification, 0.72 perplexity reduction on text generation, 2.2$\times$ speedup in training time, and 37.9% lower peak memory usage compared to standard noise-aware training methods.

Summary: This study examines Explanation for Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) models used for event sequence modeling. It aims to identify a minimal and rational explanation subset of events that ensures prediction accuracy similar to using the full history. The study highlights the pitfalls of solely defining Explanation for MTPP as either counterfactual or factual explanations. Instead, it proposes a combination of both types of explanations, Counterfactual and Factual Explainer for MTPP (CFF), to provide more effective explanations. Through deliberate techniques, CFF demonstrates higher explanation quality and processing efficiency compared to existing baselines in experiments. <div>

Abstract: Neural network-based Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) models have been widely adopted to model event sequences in high-stakes applications, raising concerns about the trustworthiness of outputs from these models. This study focuses on Explanation for MTPP, aiming to identify the minimal and rational explanation, that is, the minimum subset of events in history, based on which the prediction accuracy of MTPP matches that based on full history to a great extent and better than that based on the complement of the subset. This study finds that directly defining Explanation for MTPP as counterfactual explanation or factual explanation can result in irrational explanations. To address this issue, we define Explanation for MTPP as a combination of counterfactual explanation and factual explanation. This study proposes Counterfactual and Factual Explainer for MTPP (CFF) to solve Explanation for MTPP with a series of deliberately designed techniques. Experiments demonstrate the correctness and superiority of CFF over baselines regarding explanation quality and processing efficiency.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying high-emission vehicles is a crucial step in regulating urban pollution levels and formulating traffic emission reduction strategies. However, in practical monitoring data, the proportion of high-emission state data is significantly lower compared to normal emission states. This characteristic long-tailed distribution severely impedes the extraction of discriminative features for emission state identification during data mining. Furthermore, the highly nonlinear nature of vehicle emission states and the lack of relevant prior knowledge also pose significant challenges to the construction of identification models.To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Set-Valued Transformer Network (SVTN) to achieve comprehensive learning of discriminative features from high-emission samples, thereby enhancing detection accuracy. Specifically, this model first employs the transformer to measure the temporal similarity of micro-trip condition variations, thus constructing a mapping rule that projects the original high-dimensional emission data into a low-dimensional feature space. Next, a set-valued identification algorithm is used to probabilistically model the relationship between the generated feature vectors and their labels, providing an accurate metric criterion for the classification algorithm. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted extensive experiments on the diesel vehicle monitoring data of Hefei city in 2020. The results demonstrate that our method achieves a 9.5\% reduction in the missed detection rate for high-emission vehicles compared to the transformer-based baseline, highlighting its superior capability in accurately identifying high-emission mobile pollution sources.

Summary:
Recent advancements in large language models focus on scale, while parameter-efficient fine-tuning allows for updating a small subset of parameters. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) utilizes small matrices to store parameter deltas, enabling their straightforward combination. By training LoRA modules independently on different domains such as math, medicine, and finance, the study finds that combining these modules through simple addition can enhance model performance. Pairwise evaluations reveal improvements in perplexity, with Math+Medicine adapters yielding a -9.10% relative improvement compared to merged-data fine-tuning. The RMS cosine similarity between LoRA deltas correlates positively with changes in perplexity across different domain combinations. By applying naive summation, which requires no extra training time, comparable performance to models trained on merged data can be achieved swiftly. This approach also sheds light on the occurrence of interference in higher-order compositions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models are driven by scale, while parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) enables updating only a small fraction of parameters. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) stores parameter deltas as the product of two small matrices, which makes them natural building blocks that can be composed. Motivated by the superposition principle, we hypothesize that independently trained LoRA modules on disjoint domains are approximately orthogonal and can be combined by simple addition. Using GPT-2 Small (117M) with LoRA rank 4 and alpha=64, we train adapters for three QA domains (math, medicine, finance). In pairwise tests, adding Math+Medicine adapters improves perplexity by -9.10% relative to merged-data fine-tuning, while Math+Finance and Finance+Medicine change by +4.54% and +27.56%, respectively. Across combinations, the RMS cosine similarity between LoRA deltas correlates positively and approximately linearly with the change in perplexity. Naive summation requires no additional training, can be applied in seconds, and achieves performance comparable to models trained on merged data, while clarifying when interference appears in higher-order compositions.

Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of learning a marginally stable unknown nonlinear dynamical system. We describe an algorithm for this problem, based on the technique of spectral filtering, which learns a mapping from past observations to the next based on a spectral representation of the system. Using techniques from online convex optimization, we prove vanishing prediction error for any nonlinear dynamical system that has finitely many marginally stable modes, with rates governed by a novel quantitative control-theoretic notion of learnability. The main technical component of our method is a new spectral filtering algorithm for linear dynamical systems, which incorporates past observations and applies to general noisy and marginally stable systems. This significantly generalizes the original spectral filtering algorithm to both asymmetric dynamics as well as incorporating noise correction, and is of independent interest.

On the server side, a weighted HDC aggregation technique balances data distribution across clients. Experiment results show significant improvements in training speedup, energy efficiency, communication cost reduction, and accuracy compared to NN-based UFL approaches. FedUHD also exhibits superior robustness to various types of noise. This novel approach showcases the potential of HDC in revolutionizing federated learning for privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning applications.

arXiv:2508.12021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised federated learning (UFL) has gained attention as a privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning approach that eliminates the need for labor-intensive data labeling. However, UFL faces several challenges in practical applications: (1) non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data distribution across devices, (2) expensive computational and communication costs at the edge, and (3) vulnerability to communication noise. Previous UFL approaches have relied on deep neural networks (NN), which introduce substantial overhead in both computation and communication. In this paper, we propose FedUHD, the first UFL framework based on Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). HDC is a brain-inspired computing scheme with lightweight training and inference operations, much smaller model size, and robustness to communication noise. FedUHD introduces two novel HDC-based designs to improve UFL performance. On the client side, a kNN-based cluster hypervector removal method addresses non-iid data samples by eliminating detrimental outliers. On the server side, a weighted HDC aggregation technique balances the non-iid data distribution across clients. Our experiments demonstrate that FedUHD achieves up to 173.6x and 612.7x better speedup and energy efficiency, respectively, in training, up to 271x lower communication cost, and 15.50% higher accuracy on average across diverse settings, along with superior robustness to various types of noise compared to state-of-the-art NN-based UFL approaches.

Summary: 
This article introduces a study on Fairness in Federated Learning, focusing on performance equitable fairness to minimize performance differences across clients. The research evaluates existing and newly proposed fairness-aware methods, specifically those that regularize client losses. Connections between these methods are identified and theoretically explained. The study empirically shows that FairGrad (approximate) and FairGrad* (exact), two variants of a gradient variance regularization method introduced in the study, improve fairness and overall model performance in heterogeneous data settings. The effectiveness of fairness-aware methods in addressing disparities in client performances is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of considering heterogeneity in client data within the Federated Learning framework. <div>
arXiv:2508.12042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a vital paradigm in modern machine learning that enables collaborative training across decentralized data sources without exchanging raw data. This approach not only addresses privacy concerns but also allows access to overall substantially larger and potentially more diverse datasets, without the need for centralized storage or hardware resources. However, heterogeneity in client data may cause certain clients to have disproportionate impacts on the global model, leading to disparities in the clients' performances. Fairness, therefore, becomes a crucial concern in FL and can be addressed in various ways. However, the effectiveness of existing fairness-aware methods, particularly in heterogeneous data settings, remains unclear, and the relationships between different approaches are not well understood. In this work, we focus on performance equitable fairness, which aims to minimize differences in performance across clients. We restrict our study to fairness-aware methods that explicitly regularize client losses, evaluating both existing and newly proposed approaches. We identify and theoretically explain connections between the investigated fairness methods, and empirically show that FairGrad (approximate) and FairGrad* (exact) (two variants of a gradient variance regularization method introduced here for performance equitable fairness) improve both fairness and overall model performance in heterogeneous data settings.

Summary: 
The study introduces VARAN, a dynamic layer aggregation framework for self-supervised speech models. Conventional methods face issues with information bottlenecks and static feature weighting, whereas VARAN offers adaptiveness by tailoring layer aggregation to individual inputs. This is achieved through the use of layer-specialized probing heads and data-dependent weighting. VARAN excels in tasks like automatic speech recognition and speech emotion recognition, particularly when combined with the LoRA fine-tuning technique. By prioritizing features based on input, VARAN effectively balances the preservation of layer-specific information with flexible feature utilization, advancing the adaptation of self-supervised speech representations. <div>

Abstract: Conventional methods for aggregating layers in fine-tuned self-supervised speech models, such as using the final layer or weighted sum, suffer from information bottlenecks and static feature weighting for all dataset examples. We propose VARAN, a framework that dynamically tailors layer aggregation to individual inputs. By employing layer-specialized probing heads and data-dependent weighting, VARAN adaptively prioritizes layer's features based on input. Evaluations on automatic speech recognition and speech emotion recognition tasks demonstrate VARAN's superior performance, particularly when using the LoRA fine-tuning technique. The framework resolves the trade-off between preserving layer-specific information and enabling flexible feature utilization, advancing efficient adaptation of self-supervised speech representations.

The article introduces the concept of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) to enhance Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) networks. It addresses the challenge of ensuring content accuracy in AIGC services when generating content based on inaccurate sensed data and introduces a novel metric, Content Accuracy and Quality Aware Service Assessment (CAQA). The article discusses the tradeoff between sensing, generating, and communication resources for maximizing the average CAQA across users with AIGC. To tackle this NP-hard problem, a Linear Programming (LP) guided Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm with an action filter (LPDRL-F) is proposed. Simulations show that LPDRL-F outperforms existing algorithms by converging faster and finding better resource allocation solutions, leading to a significant improvement in AvgCAQA. By focusing on content accuracy in addition to content generation quality, the proposed approach offers a more comprehensive evaluation of ISAC-based AIGC services.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can enhance artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) networks by providing efficient sensing and transmission. Existing AIGC services usually assume that the accuracy of the generated content can be ensured, given accurate input data and prompt, thus only the content generation quality (CGQ) is concerned. However, it is not applicable in ISAC-based AIGC networks, where content generation is based on inaccurate sensed data. Moreover, the AIGC model itself introduces generation errors, which depend on the number of generating steps (i.e., computing resources). To assess the quality of experience of ISAC-based AIGC services, we propose a content accuracy and quality aware service assessment metric (CAQA). Since allocating more resources to sensing and generating improves content accuracy but may reduce communication quality, and vice versa, this sensing-generating (computing)-communication three-dimensional resource tradeoff must be optimized to maximize the average CAQA (AvgCAQA) across all users with AIGC (CAQA-AIGC). This problem is NP-hard, with a large solution space that grows exponentially with users. To solve the CAQA-AIGC problem with low complexity, a linear programming (LP) guided deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with an action filter (LPDRL-F) is proposed. Through the LP-guided approach and the action filter, LPDRL-F can transform the original three-dimensional solution space to two dimensions, reducing complexity while improving the learning performance of DRL. Simulations show that compared to existing DRL and generative diffusion model algorithms without LP, LPDRL-F converges faster by over 60% and finds better resource allocation solutions, improving AvgCAQA by more than 14%. With LPDRL-F, CAQA-AIGC can achieve an improvement in AvgCAQA of more than 50% compared to existing schemes focusing solely on CGQ.

Summary:  
CoMET is a family of decoder-only transformer models pretrained on a vast dataset of medical events, demonstrating power-law scaling relationships for compute, tokens, and model size. The models, which can simulate patient health timelines based on real-world history, outperformed task-specific supervised models on various real-world tasks without fine-tuning. CoMET's predictive accuracy improves with scaling, offering a generalizable framework for clinical decision-making, healthcare operation streamlining, and patient outcome improvement. <div>

Abstract: Realizing personalized medicine at scale calls for methods that distill insights from longitudinal patient journeys, which can be viewed as a sequence of medical events. Foundation models pretrained on large-scale medical event data represent a promising direction for scaling real-world evidence generation and generalizing to diverse downstream tasks. Using Epic Cosmos, a dataset with medical events from de-identified longitudinal health records for 16.3 billion encounters over 300 million unique patient records from 310 health systems, we introduce the Cosmos Medical Event Transformer ( CoMET) models, a family of decoder-only transformer models pretrained on 118 million patients representing 115 billion discrete medical events (151 billion tokens). We present the largest scaling-law study for medical event data, establishing a methodology for pretraining and revealing power-law scaling relationships for compute, tokens, and model size. Based on this, we pretrained a series of compute-optimal models with up to 1 billion parameters. Conditioned on a patient's real-world history, CoMET autoregressively generates the next medical event, simulating patient health timelines. We studied 78 real-world tasks, including diagnosis prediction, disease prognosis, and healthcare operations. Remarkably for a foundation model with generic pretraining and simulation-based inference, CoMET generally outperformed or matched task-specific supervised models on these tasks, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or few-shot examples. CoMET's predictive power consistently improves as the model and pretraining scale. Our results show that CoMET, a generative medical event foundation model, can effectively capture complex clinical dynamics, providing an extensible and generalizable framework to support clinical decision-making, streamline healthcare operations, and improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: As numerous instruction-tuning datasets continue to emerge during the post-training stage, dynamically balancing and optimizing their mixtures has become a critical challenge. To address this, we propose DynamixSFT, a dynamic and automated method for instruction-tuning dataset mixture optimization. We formulate the problem as a multi-armed bandit setup and introduce a Prior-scaled Boltzmann Exploration that softly anchors the updated sampling distribution to the original dataset proportions, thereby preserving the inherent diversity and coverage of the collection. Sampling probabilities are updated using a lightweight 1-Step Look-ahead Reward, reflecting how much the dataset contributes to improving the model's performance at its current state. When applied to the Tulu-v2-mixture collection comprising 16 instruction-tuning datasets, DynamixSFT achieves up to a 2.2% performance improvement across 10 benchmarks. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis and visualizations to offer deeper insights into the adaptive dynamics of our method.

<div> gating mechanisms, recurrent neural networks, adaptive learning-rate behavior, parameter updates, optimization trajectories

Summary: 
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) utilize gating mechanisms that implicitly induce adaptive learning-rate behavior during training with a fixed global learning rate. By analyzing leaky-integrator and gated RNNs, researchers found that gates affect gradient propagation, modify step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in parameter updates. These gates act as data-driven preconditioners that adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space, leading to behaviors similar to learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods like Adam. Numerical experiments confirmed the small yet systematic effects of gate-induced corrections on training dynamics. This study provides a unified perspective on how gating in RNNs connects state evolution with parameter updates, explaining the robust trainability and stability of gated architectures in practical applications. <div>
arXiv:2508.12121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how gating mechanisms in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) implicitly induce adaptive learning-rate behavior, even when training is carried out with a fixed, global learning rate. This effect arises from the coupling between state-space time scales--parametrized by the gates--and parameter-space dynamics during gradient descent. By deriving exact Jacobians for leaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes explicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient propagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in parameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control memory retention in the hidden states, but also act as data-driven preconditioners that adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal analogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as Adam, showing that these optimization behaviors emerge naturally from gating. Numerical experiments confirm the validity of our perturbative analysis, supporting the view that gate-induced corrections remain small while exerting systematic effects on training dynamics. Overall, this work provides a unified dynamical-systems perspective on how gating couples state evolution with parameter updates, explaining why gated architectures achieve robust trainability and stability in practice.

<div> Variational autoencoder, parametric projection, invertible projection, uncertainty, multidimensional data <br />
Summary:<br />
DE-VAE is introduced as an uncertainty-aware variational autoencoder that enhances parametric and invertible projections by utilizing differential entropy. It focuses on creating efficient projections for both known and unseen samples without the need for recalculating the entire projection. Through training on fixed projections, DE-VAE learns mappings into 2D space and back to the original space. The method is evaluated on four prominent datasets, comparing favorably with existing autoencoder-based approaches. DE-VAE enables the analysis of embedding uncertainty, providing insight into out-of-distribution samples in the data or embedding space. The results demonstrate its ability to generate accurate projections while addressing the limitations of other methods, making it a promising approach for multidimensional data projection tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.12145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, autoencoders (AEs) have gained interest for creating parametric and invertible projections of multidimensional data. Parametric projections make it possible to embed new, unseen samples without recalculating the entire projection, while invertible projections allow the synthesis of new data instances. However, existing methods perform poorly when dealing with out-of-distribution samples in either the data or embedding space. Thus, we propose DE-VAE, an uncertainty-aware variational AE using differential entropy (DE) to improve the learned parametric and invertible projections. Given a fixed projection, we train DE-VAE to learn a mapping into 2D space and an inverse mapping back to the original space. We conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations on four well-known datasets, using UMAP and t-SNE as baseline projection methods. Our findings show that DE-VAE can create parametric and inverse projections with comparable accuracy to other current AE-based approaches while enabling the analysis of embedding uncertainty.

Summary:
The article introduces a new deep learning architecture called the attention-integrated convolutional residual network (AICRN) for interpreting electrocardiogram (ECG) data. This architecture is designed to regress key ECG parameters such as the PR interval and heart rate for more precise analysis. The models utilize spatial and channel attention mechanisms to address the type and spatial location of ECG features, improving interpretability. The convolutional residual network helps overcome gradient problems commonly encountered in ECG analysis. By reducing manual efforts and increasing accuracy, AICRN models outperform existing methods in parameter regression.

Abstract: The paradigm of electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has evolved into real-time digital analysis, facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), which has improved the diagnostic precision and predictive capacity of cardiac diseases. This work proposes a novel deep learning (DL) architecture called the attention-integrated convolutional residual network (AICRN) to regress key ECG parameters such as the PR interval, the QT interval, the QRS duration, the heart rate, the peak amplitude of the R wave, and the amplitude of the T wave for interpretable ECG analysis. Our architecture is specially designed with spatial and channel attention-related mechanisms to address the type and spatial location of the ECG features for regression. The models employ a convolutional residual network to address vanishing and exploding gradient problems. The designed system addresses traditional analysis challenges, such as loss of focus due to human errors, and facilitates the fast and easy detection of cardiac events, thereby reducing the manual efforts required to solve analysis tasks. AICRN models outperform existing models in parameter regression with higher precision. This work demonstrates that DL can play a crucial role in the interpretability and precision of ECG analysis, opening up new clinical applications for cardiac monitoring and management.

Summary: 
- ProtTeX-CC is a framework designed to improve protein language models under few-shot settings.
- It addresses issues of increased protein length and lack of in-context learning in ProtTeX.
- It features a joint embedding compression mechanism that reduces protein input length by half without sacrificing performance.
- Additionally, a self-compression module further reduces average demonstration length by a significant amount.
- ProtTeX-CC achieves a high compression ratio and improves protein function prediction performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.12212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in protein large language models, such as ProtTeX, represent both side-chain amino acids and backbone structure as discrete token sequences of residue length. While this design enables unified modeling of multimodal protein information, it suffers from two major limitations: (1) The concatenation of sequence and structure tokens approximately doubles the protein length and breaks the intrinsic residue-level alignment between modalities. (2) Constrained by the training corpus and limited context window, ProtTeX is typically trained on single-protein inputs, rendering it incompatible with in-context learning (ICL) and thus limiting its generalization capability. To address these issues, we propose ProtTeX-CC, a lightweight two-stage compression framework designed to enhance ProtTeX under few-shot settings. We first design a joint embedding compression mechanism that fuses sequence and structure representations at the residue level, effectively reducing the protein input length by half without sacrificing performance. Then we propose a self-compression module that aggregates each full demonstration into the latent space of the last few linguistic tokens, reducing the average demonstration length from 751 tokens to less than 16 tokens. Compared to the original ProtTeX, our self-compression approach achieves a compression ratio of approximately 93.68% in the total prompt length under the 16-shot setting. Without modifying the backbone model, ProtTeX-CC introduces only a small number of additional parameters through PEFT-based tuning in the joint embedding compression stage and a single trainable projection layer in the self-compression stage. Extensive experiments on protein function prediction show that ProtTeX-CC improves performance on the in-domain benchmark by 2%, and generalizes well to the out-of-domain dataset with a performance gain of 11%.

<div> right to be forgotten, language models, unlearning, reproducible systems, GDPR

Summary:
The study focuses on implementing the right to be forgotten (GDPR Art. 17) for large language models by framing unlearning as a reproducible systems problem. The approach involves treating training as a deterministic program and logging specific training details. By replaying the training tail while filtering the forget closure, the same parameters can be achieved as training on the retain set. Additional paths are introduced to meet latency and availability constraints, including exact reverts, cohort-scoped adapter deletion, and a curvature-guided anti-update. The article reports on storage/latency budgets and provides a toy artifact to validate the mechanics. A controlled run demonstrated byte-identical equality of model and optimizer states when preconditions were met. <div>

Abstract: We study the right to be forgotten (GDPR Art. 17) for large language models and frame unlearning as a reproducible systems problem. Our approach treats training as a deterministic program and logs a minimal per-microbatch record (ordered ID hash, RNG seed, learning-rate value, optimizer-step counter, and accumulation boundary). Under a pinned stack and deterministic kernels, replaying the training tail while filtering only the forget closure yields the same parameters as training on the retain set (bit-identical in the training dtype) when preconditions hold. To meet latency and availability constraints, we add complementary paths: (i) exact reverts of recent steps via micro-checkpoints or dense per-step deltas, (ii) cohort-scoped adapter deletion when the base is frozen, and (iii) a curvature-guided anti-update followed by a short retain-tune, audit-gated with escalation to exact replay. We report storage/latency budgets and a toy artifact validating mechanics; in a controlled run that satisfies the preconditions we demonstrate byte-identical equality of model and optimizer states.

Summary:<br />
Recent advances in generative models have shown significant progress in various data modalities, with applications beyond data synthesis to tasks like latent variable modeling, domain translation, and domain adaptation. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are commonly used for distribution matching due to their effectiveness with high-dimensional data and adaptability to constraints. However, GANs can face challenges in training due to their optimization objective and susceptibility to mode collapse. This study introduces a novel distribution matching approach inspired by consistency models from Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF). The proposed model combines the advantages of CNF models, such as a straightforward norm minimization objective, with the flexibility of GANs. The theoretical validation and experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advancement in generative models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various data modalities. Beyond their typical use in data synthesis, these models play a crucial role in distribution matching tasks such as latent variable modeling, domain translation, and domain adaptation. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as the preferred method of distribution matching due to their efficacy in handling high-dimensional data and their flexibility in accommodating various constraints. However, GANs often encounter challenge in training due to their bi-level min-max optimization objective and susceptibility to mode collapse. In this work, we propose a novel approach for distribution matching inspired by the consistency models employed in Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF). Our model inherits the advantages of CNF models, such as having a straight forward norm minimization objective, while remaining adaptable to different constraints similar to GANs. We provide theoretical validation of our proposed objective and demonstrate its performance through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: In distributed optimization and federated learning, asynchronous alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) serves as an attractive option for large-scale optimization, data privacy, straggler nodes and variety of objective functions. However, communication costs can become a major bottleneck when the nodes have limited communication budgets or when the data to be communicated is prohibitively large. In this work, we propose introducing coarse quantization to the data to be exchanged in aynchronous ADMM so as to reduce communication overhead for large-scale federated learning and distributed optimization applications. We experimentally verify the convergence of the proposed method for several distributed learning tasks, including neural networks.

Summary: 
Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time) addresses the challenge of achieving high prediction accuracy in time series forecasting using pre-trained language models (PLMs). The method explores modeling temporal dependency and channel correlations in the language model through cross-modality learning from time series sequences and their text descriptions. Additionally, the cross-model fusion block integrates knowledge from both PLMs and time series models to enhance the modeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in full-data training and few-shot learning scenarios. Overall, CC-Time showcases the potential of PLMs in improving time series forecasting accuracy and highlights the importance of combining PLMs with traditional time series models for robust predictions.

Abstract: With the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in various application fields beyond natural language processing, language models have raised emerging attention in the field of time series forecasting (TSF) and have shown great prospects. However, current PLM-based TSF methods still fail to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy matching the strong sequential modeling power of language models. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time). We explore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1) what time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying solely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first aspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal dependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series sequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect, CC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate knowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive modeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in both full-data training and few-shot learning situations.

Abstract: Although conventional deep graph models have achieved great success in relational learning, their focus on pairwise relationships limits their capacity to learn pervasive higher-order interactions in real-world complex systems, which can be naturally modeled as hypergraphs. To tackle this, hypergraph neural networks (HNNs), the dominant approach in deep hypergraph learning (DHGL), has garnered substantial attention in recent years. Despite the proposal of numerous HNN methods, there is no comprehensive benchmark for HNNs, which creates a great obstacle to understanding the progress of DHGL in several aspects: (i) insufficient coverage of datasets, algorithms, and tasks; (ii) a narrow evaluation of algorithm performance; and (iii) inconsistent dataset usage, preprocessing, and experimental setups that hinder comparability. To fill the gap, we introduce DHG-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for DHGL. Specifically, DHG-Bench integrates 20 diverse datasets spanning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks, along with 16 state-of-the-art HNN algorithms, under consistent data processing and experimental protocols. Our benchmark systematically investigates the characteristics of HNNs in terms of four dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and fairness. Further, to facilitate reproducible research, we have developed an easy-to-use library for training and evaluating different HNN methods. Extensive experiments conducted with DHG-Bench reveal both the strengths and inherent limitations of existing algorithms, offering valuable insights and directions for future research. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Coco-Hut/DHG-Bench.

<div> Keywords: spatio-temporal prediction, deep learning, multiscale information, hierarchical aggregation, causal convolution network 

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel deep learning method called Spatio-Temporal Multiscale Mamba (STM2) for efficiently learning long-term spatio-temporal dependencies. STM2 addresses the challenges of extracting multiscale information and modeling correlated temporal data from different nodes through a multiscale Mamba architecture and an adaptive graph causal convolution network. Furthermore, an enhanced version called Spatio-Temporal Mixture of Multiscale Mamba (STM3) is proposed, incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with improved routing and contrastive learning strategies. This approach enhances scale distinguishability, routing smoothness, and pattern disentanglement among experts. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that STM2 and STM3 outperform existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.12247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, spatio-temporal time-series prediction has developed rapidly, yet existing deep learning methods struggle with learning complex long-term spatio-temporal dependencies efficiently. The long-term spatio-temporal dependency learning brings two new challenges: 1) The long-term temporal sequence includes multiscale information naturally which is hard to extract efficiently; 2) The multiscale temporal information from different nodes is highly correlated and hard to model. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM2) that includes a multiscale Mamba architecture to capture the multiscale information efficiently and simultaneously, and an adaptive graph causal convolution network to learn the complex multiscale spatio-temporal dependency. STM2 includes hierarchical information aggregation for different-scale information that guarantees their distinguishability. To capture diverse temporal dynamics across all spatial nodes more efficiently, we further propose an enhanced version termed \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM3) that employs a special Mixture-of-Experts architecture, including a more stable routing strategy and a causal contrastive learning strategy to enhance the scale distinguishability. We prove that STM3 has much better routing smoothness and guarantees the pattern disentanglement for each expert successfully. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate STM2/STM3's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting underpins critical decisions across aviation, energy, retail and health. Classical autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models offer interpretability via coefficients but struggle with nonlinearities, whereas tree-based machine-learning models such as XGBoost deliver high accuracy but are often opaque. This paper presents a unified framework for interpreting time-series forecasts using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP). We convert a univariate series into a leakage-free supervised learning problem, train a gradient-boosted tree alongside an ARIMA baseline and apply post-hoc explainability. Using the Air Passengers dataset as a case study, we show that a small set of lagged features -- particularly the twelve-month lag -- and seasonal encodings explain most forecast variance. We contribute: (i) a methodology for applying LIME and SHAP to time series without violating chronology; (ii) theoretical exposition of the underlying algorithms; (iii) empirical evaluation with extensive analysis; and (iv) guidelines for practitioners.

<div> learned optimizer, second-order, Symmetric-Rank-One, Monocular Human Mesh Recovery, generalization

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel learned second-order optimizer that enhances the classical Symmetric-Rank-One algorithm by incorporating a trainable preconditioning unit. This unit generates data-driven vectors to construct positive semi-definite rank-one matrices aligned with the secant constraint via a learned projection. By leveraging this approach, the method demonstrates improved performance in both analytic experiments and the real-world task of Monocular Human Mesh Recovery (HMR). Notably, the proposed method outperforms existing learned optimization-based approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization. With a lightweight model and no need for annotated data or fine-tuning, this approach offers strong generalization capabilities and is well-suited for integration into broader optimization-based frameworks. This combination of data efficiency, lightweight design, and strong generalization makes the proposed method a promising candidate for a wide range of optimization tasks in the field.

Abstract: End-to-end deep learning has achieved impressive results but remains limited by its reliance on large labeled datasets, poor generalization to unseen scenarios, and growing computational demands. In contrast, classical optimization methods are data-efficient and lightweight but often suffer from slow convergence. While learned optimizers offer a promising fusion of both worlds, most focus on first-order methods, leaving learned second-order approaches largely unexplored.
  We propose a novel learned second-order optimizer that introduces a trainable preconditioning unit to enhance the classical Symmetric-Rank-One (SR1) algorithm. This unit generates data-driven vectors used to construct positive semi-definite rank-one matrices, aligned with the secant constraint via a learned projection. Our method is evaluated through analytic experiments and on the real-world task of Monocular Human Mesh Recovery (HMR), where it outperforms existing learned optimization-based approaches. Featuring a lightweight model and requiring no annotated data or fine-tuning, our approach offers strong generalization and is well-suited for integration into broader optimization-based frameworks.

<div> Graph Neural Networks, Graph Anomaly Detection, Context Refactoring Contrast, Limited labeled data, Unlabeled data<br />
<br />Summary: <br />Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are essential for graph-related tasks but require ample labeled data, which is often scarce in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD). The proposed Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC) framework tackles this challenge by leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. By refactoring node contexts and encoding heterogeneous relations separately, CRoC enhances model capacity and robustness against adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to detect anomalies effectively. Integrating contrastive learning with CRoC further improves model performance, producing richer node embeddings. Experimental results on seven real-world GAD datasets demonstrate that CRoC outperforms baseline GNNs by up to 14% in terms of AUC and surpasses state-of-the-art GAD methods when labeled data is limited. <div>
arXiv:2508.12278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used as the engine for various graph-related tasks, with their effectiveness in analyzing graph-structured data. However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which is a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely impedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are inherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to evade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore, CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14% AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods under limited-label settings.

<div> convergence rate, Lion optimizer, variance reduction, distributed settings, communication-efficient variant
Summary:
The paper analyzes the convergence properties of the Lion optimizer, showing that it achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/4})$. By introducing variance reduction, the enhanced convergence rate becomes $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/3}) in standard settings. In distributed settings, both standard and variance-reduced versions of the distributed Lion show convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/4})$ and $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/3})$, respectively. A communication-efficient variant of the distributed Lion is investigated, ensuring sign compression in communication. Utilizing unbiased sign operations, the proposed Lion variant and its variance reduction achieve convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}\left( \max \left\{\frac{d^{1/4}}{T^{1/4}}, \frac{d^{1/10}}{n^{1/5}T^{1/5}} \right\} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( \frac{d^{1/4}}{T^{1/4}} \right)$, respectively.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the convergence properties of the Lion optimizer. First, we establish that the Lion optimizer attains a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/4})$ under standard assumptions, where $d$ denotes the problem dimension and $T$ is the iteration number. To further improve this rate, we introduce the Lion optimizer with variance reduction, resulting in an enhanced convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/3})$. We then analyze in distributed settings, where the standard and variance reduced version of the distributed Lion can obtain the convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/4})$ and $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/3})$, with $n$ denoting the number of nodes. Furthermore, we investigate a communication-efficient variant of the distributed Lion that ensures sign compression in both communication directions. By employing the unbiased sign operations, the proposed Lion variant and its variance reduction counterpart, achieve convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}\left( \max \left\{\frac{d^{1/4}}{T^{1/4}}, \frac{d^{1/10}}{n^{1/5}T^{1/5}} \right\} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( \frac{d^{1/4}}{T^{1/4}} \right)$, respectively.

Summary:<br /><br />
The article explores the adaptation of inference-time scaling to diffusion models and proposes two strategies, Funnel Schedule and Adaptive Temperature, to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off in Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based methods. These methods aim to improve sample quality without increasing Noise Function Evaluations. Experimental results on various benchmarks and text-to-image diffusion models show that the approach outperforms previous baselines by preserving diversity during multi-modal search and leveraging the unique generation dynamics of diffusion models. <div>
arXiv:2508.12361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference-time scaling has achieved remarkable success in language models, yet its adaptation to diffusion models remains underexplored. We observe that the efficacy of recent Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based methods largely stems from globally fitting the The reward-tilted distribution, which inherently preserves diversity during multi-modal search. However, current applications of SMC to diffusion models face a fundamental dilemma: early-stage noise samples offer high potential for improvement but are difficult to evaluate accurately, whereas late-stage samples can be reliably assessed but are largely irreversible. To address this exploration-exploitation trade-off, we approach the problem from the perspective of the search algorithm and propose two strategies: Funnel Schedule and Adaptive Temperature. These simple yet effective methods are tailored to the unique generation dynamics and phase-transition behavior of diffusion models. By progressively reducing the number of maintained particles and down-weighting the influence of early-stage rewards, our methods significantly enhance sample quality without increasing the total number of Noise Function Evaluations. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks and state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous baselines.

Summary:<br /><br />Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are a valuable resource for research but pose challenges due to their complexity. The Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT) is introduced to enhance EHR classification by attending to both clinical variables and time points, improving data relationships and addressing data sparsity issues. BAT outperforms current methods in sepsis prediction and mortality classification, showing robustness to missing data and enabling unique sensor embeddings for transfer learning.

arXiv:2508.12418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), the digital representation of a patient's medical history, are a valuable resource for epidemiological and clinical research. They are also becoming increasingly complex, with recent trends indicating larger datasets, longer time series, and multi-modal integrations. Transformers, which have rapidly gained popularity due to their success in natural language processing and other domains, are well-suited to address these challenges due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and process data in parallel. But their application to EHR classification remains limited by data representations, which can reduce performance or fail to capture informative missingness. In this paper, we present the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), which attends to both the clinical variable and time point axes of EHR data to learn richer data relationships and address the difficulties of data sparsity. BAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on sepsis prediction and is competitive to top methods for mortality classification. In comparison to other transformers, BAT demonstrates increased robustness to data missingness, and learns unique sensor embeddings which can be used in transfer learning. Baseline models, which were previously located across multiple repositories or utilized deprecated libraries, were re-implemented with PyTorch and made available for reproduction and future benchmarking.

Summary:
An integrated machine learning framework has been developed to improve the estimation of manufacturing costs from 2D engineering drawings. By analyzing a large dataset of automotive suspension and steering parts drawings, the framework extracts over 200 geometric and statistical descriptors. Decision tree models trained on these features achieve high accuracy in cost prediction, demonstrating scalability across different product groups. The framework also includes explainability tools to identify design drivers influencing cost, such as rotated dimension maxima and arc statistics. This CAD-to-cost pipeline streamlines quotation lead times, ensures consistent cost assessments, and provides actionable insights for cost-aware design. The framework sets the stage for real-time decision support in Industry 4.0 manufacturing environments by integrating cost estimation with ERP systems. <div>

Abstract: We present an integrated machine learning framework that transforms how manufacturing cost is estimated from 2D engineering drawings. Unlike traditional quotation workflows that require labor-intensive process planning, our approach about 200 geometric and statistical descriptors directly from 13,684 DWG drawings of automotive suspension and steering parts spanning 24 product groups. Gradient-boosted decision tree models (XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM) trained on these features achieve nearly 10% mean absolute percentage error across groups, demonstrating robust scalability beyond part-specific heuristics. By coupling cost prediction with explainability tools such as SHAP, the framework identifies geometric design drivers including rotated dimension maxima, arc statistics and divergence metrics, offering actionable insights for cost-aware design. This end-to-end CAD-to-cost pipeline shortens quotation lead times, ensures consistent and transparent cost assessments across part families and provides a deployable pathway toward real-time, ERP-integrated decision support in Industry 4.0 manufacturing environments.

Summary: 
This article introduces an adaptive mean shift algorithm specifically tailored for datasets with varying local scale and cluster cardinality. It utilizes local distance distributions to estimate the number of points in a local cluster, allowing for the computation of local cluster parameters for the entire cluster. Unlike KDE-based methods that focus on localized regions, this algorithm provides insights into the entire cluster. During mean shift execution, adjustments are made to the bandwidth and mean shift kernel radius threshold based on the cluster cardinality estimate. The algorithm showed superior performance compared to a recent adaptive mean shift method on its original dataset and performed competitively on a broader clustering benchmark. This approach offers a promising solution for clustering datasets with varying local characteristics.

Abstract: This article presents an adaptive mean shift algorithm designed for datasets with varying local scale and cluster cardinality. Local distance distributions, from a point to all others, are used to estimate the cardinality of the local cluster by identifying a local minimum in the density of the distance distribution. Based on these cardinality estimates, local cluster parameters are then computed for the entire cluster in contrast to KDE-based methods, which provide insight only into localized regions of the cluster. During the mean shift execution, the cluster cardinality estimate is used to adaptively adjust the bandwidth and the mean shift kernel radius threshold. Our algorithm outperformed a recently proposed adaptive mean shift method on its original dataset and demonstrated competitive performance on a broader clustering benchmark.

<title>Cold-RL: Learning Cache Eviction with Offline Reinforcement Learning for NGINX</title>

<div> Keywords: Web proxies, NGINX, Cold-RL, Machine learning, Eviction policy

Summary: 
Cold-RL is a learned eviction policy for NGINX that utilizes a dueling Deep Q-Network to improve eviction performance under periodic bursts and mixed object sizes. The policy samples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts lightweight features, and requests a bitmask of victims, with a fallback to native LRU if a hard timeout is reached. By training policies offline using NGINX access logs and a cache simulator, Cold-RL significantly improves hit ratios compared to classical baselines. With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL achieves a 146 percent improvement in hit ratio, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in eviction policies. The inference process incurs minimal CPU overhead and maintains eviction latency within budget constraints, making it a practical solution for web proxies like NGINX with strict SLOs.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.12485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web proxies such as NGINX commonly rely on least-recently-used (LRU) eviction, which is size agnostic and can thrash under periodic bursts and mixed object sizes. We introduce Cold-RL, a learned eviction policy for NGINX that replaces LRU's forced-expire path with a dueling Deep Q-Network served by an ONNX sidecar within a strict microsecond budget. On each eviction, Cold-RL samples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts six lightweight features (age, size, hit count, inter-arrival time, remaining TTL, and last origin RTT), and requests a bitmask of victims; a hard timeout of 500 microseconds triggers immediate fallback to native LRU. Policies are trained offline by replaying NGINX access logs through a cache simulator with a simple reward: a retained object earns one point if it is hit again before TTL expiry. We compare against LRU, LFU, size-based, adaptive LRU, and a hybrid baseline on two adversarial workloads. With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL raises hit ratio from 0.1436 to 0.3538, a 146 percent improvement over the best classical baseline; at 100 MB, from 0.7530 to 0.8675, a 15 percent gain; and at 400 MB it matches classical methods (about 0.918). Inference adds less than 2 percent CPU overhead and keeps 95th percentile eviction latency within budget. To our knowledge, this is the first reinforcement learning eviction policy integrated into NGINX with strict SLOs.

Summary:  
Cost-Spectrum Contrastive Routing (CSCR) is introduced as a lightweight framework for cost-aware routing of large language models (LLMs) across diverse and dynamic pools. CSCR maps prompts and models into a shared embedding space to enable fast, cost-sensitive selection. It uses compact logit footprints for open-source models and perplexity fingerprints for black-box APIs. A contrastive encoder is trained to select the cheapest accurate expert within adaptive cost bands, reducing routing to a single k-NN lookup at inference time. CSCR consistently outperforms baselines, improving the accuracy-cost tradeoff by up to 25% across multiple benchmarks. It generalizes robustly to unseen LLMs and out-of-distribution prompts, requiring no retraining when the expert pool changes and enabling microsecond latency. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We study cost-aware routing for large language models across diverse and dynamic pools of models. Existing approaches often overlook prompt-specific context, rely on expensive model profiling, assume a fixed set of experts, or use inefficient trial-and-error strategies. We introduce Cost-Spectrum Contrastive Routing (CSCR), a lightweight framework that maps both prompts and models into a shared embedding space to enable fast, cost-sensitive selection. CSCR uses compact, fast-to-compute logit footprints for open-source models and perplexity fingerprints for black-box APIs. A contrastive encoder is trained to favor the cheapest accurate expert within adaptive cost bands. At inference time, routing reduces to a single k-NN lookup via a FAISS index, requiring no retraining when the expert pool changes and enabling microsecond latency. Across multiple benchmarks, CSCR consistently outperforms baselines, improving the accuracy-cost tradeoff by up to 25%, while generalizing robustly to unseen LLMs and out-of-distribution prompts.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving stochastic optimal control problems with quadratic control costs can be viewed as approximating a target path space measure, e.g. via gradient-based optimization. In practice, however, this optimization is challenging in particular if the target measure differs substantially from the prior. In this work, we therefore approach the problem by iteratively solving constrained problems incorporating trust regions that aim for approaching the target measure gradually in a systematic way. It turns out that this trust region based strategy can be understood as a geometric annealing from the prior to the target measure, where, however, the incorporated trust regions lead to a principled and educated way of choosing the time steps in the annealing path. We demonstrate in multiple optimal control applications that our novel method can improve performance significantly, including tasks in diffusion-based sampling, transition path sampling, and fine-tuning of diffusion models.

<title>Toward Architecture-Agnostic Local Control of Posterior Collapse in VAEs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs), one of the most widely used generative models, are known to suffer from posterior collapse, a phenomenon that reduces the diversity of generated samples. To avoid posterior collapse, many prior works have tried to control the influence of regularization loss. However, the trade-off between reconstruction and regularization is not satisfactory. For this reason, several methods have been proposed to guarantee latent identifiability, which is the key to avoiding posterior collapse. However, they require structural constraints on the network architecture. For further clarification, we define local posterior collapse to reflect the importance of individual sample points in the data space and to relax the network constraint. Then, we propose Latent Reconstruction(LR) loss, which is inspired by mathematical properties of injective and composite functions, to control posterior collapse without restriction to a specific architecture. We experimentally evaluate our approach, which controls posterior collapse on varied datasets such as MNIST, fashionMNIST, Omniglot, CelebA, and FFHQ.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning language models is commonly believed to inevitably harm their safety, i.e., refusing to respond to harmful user requests, even when using harmless datasets, thus requiring additional safety measures. We challenge this belief through systematic testing, showing that poor optimization choices, rather than inherent trade-offs, often cause safety problems, measured as harmful responses to adversarial prompts. By properly selecting key training hyper-parameters, e.g., learning rate, batch size, and gradient steps, we reduce unsafe model responses from 16\% to approximately 5\%, as measured by keyword matching, while maintaining utility performance. Based on this observation, we propose a simple exponential moving average (EMA) momentum technique in parameter space that preserves safety performance by creating a stable optimization path and retains the original pre-trained model's safety properties. Our experiments on the Llama families across multiple datasets (Dolly, Alpaca, ORCA) demonstrate that safety problems during fine-tuning can largely be avoided without specialized interventions, outperforming existing approaches that require additional safety data while offering practical guidelines for maintaining both model performance and safety during adaptation.

Abstract: The construction of brain graphs from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data plays a crucial role in enabling graph machine learning for neuroimaging. However, current practices often rely on rigid pipelines that overlook critical data-centric choices in how brain graphs are constructed. In this work, we adopt a Data-Centric AI perspective and systematically define and benchmark a data-centric design space for brain graph construction, constrasting with primarily model-centric prior work. We organize this design space into three stages: temporal signal processing, topology extraction, and graph featurization. Our contributions lie less in novel components and more in evaluating how combinations of existing and modified techniques influence downstream performance. Specifically, we study high-amplitude BOLD signal filtering, sparsification and unification strategies for connectivity, alternative correlation metrics, and multi-view node and edge features, such as incorporating lagged dynamics. Experiments on the HCP1200 and ABIDE datasets show that thoughtful data-centric configurations consistently improve classification accuracy over standard pipelines. These findings highlight the critical role of upstream data decisions and underscore the importance of systematically exploring the data-centric design space for graph-based neuroimaging.

Abstract: Linux kernel tuning is essential for optimizing operating system (OS) performance. However, existing methods often face challenges in terms of efficiency, scalability, and generalization. This paper introduces OS-R1, an agentic Linux kernel tuning framework powered by rule-based reinforcement learning (RL). By abstracting the kernel configuration space as an RL environment, OS-R1 facilitates efficient exploration by large language models (LLMs) and ensures accurate configuration modifications. Additionally, custom reward functions are designed to enhance reasoning standardization, configuration modification accuracy, and system performance awareness of the LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a two-phase training process that accelerates convergence and minimizes retraining across diverse tuning scenarios. Experimental results show that OS-R1 significantly outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving up to 5.6% performance improvement over heuristic tuning and maintaining high data efficiency. Notably, OS-R1 is adaptable across various real-world applications, demonstrating its potential for practical deployment in diverse environments.

Abstract: Coding agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have gained traction for automating code generation through iterative problem-solving with minimal human involvement. Despite the emergence of various frameworks, e.g., LangChain, AutoML, and AIDE, ML scientists still struggle to effectively review and adjust the agents' coding process. The current approach of manually inspecting individual outputs is inefficient, making it difficult to track code evolution, compare coding iterations, and identify improvement opportunities. To address this challenge, we introduce a visual analytics system designed to enhance the examination of coding agent behaviors. Focusing on the AIDE framework, our system supports comparative analysis across three levels: (1) Code-Level Analysis, which reveals how the agent debugs and refines its code over iterations; (2) Process-Level Analysis, which contrasts different solution-seeking processes explored by the agent; and (3) LLM-Level Analysis, which highlights variations in coding behavior across different LLMs. By integrating these perspectives, our system enables ML scientists to gain a structured understanding of agent behaviors, facilitating more effective debugging and prompt engineering. Through case studies using coding agents to tackle popular Kaggle competitions, we demonstrate how our system provides valuable insights into the iterative coding process.

Abstract: To address the complexity of financial time series, this paper proposes a forecasting model combining sliding window and variational mode decomposition (VMD) methods. Historical stock prices and relevant market indicators are used to construct datasets. VMD decomposes non-stationary financial time series into smoother subcomponents, improving model adaptability. The decomposed data is then input into a deep learning model for prediction. The study compares the forecasting effects of an LSTM model trained on VMD-processed sequences with those using raw time series, demonstrating better performance and stability.

<title>Data-driven particle dynamics: Structure-preserving coarse-graining for emergent behavior in non-equilibrium systems</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12569</link>

arXiv:2508.12569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiscale systems are ubiquitous in science and technology, but are notoriously challenging to simulate as short spatiotemporal scales must be appropriately linked to emergent bulk physics. When expensive high-dimensional dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative, history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1) coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.

Abstract: The prediction of amyloidogenicity in peptides and proteins remains a focal point of ongoing bioinformatics. The crucial step in this field is to apply advanced computational methodologies. Many recent approaches to predicting amyloidogenicity within proteins are highly based on evolutionary motifs and the individual properties of amino acids. It is becoming increasingly evident that the sequence information-based features show high predictive performance. Consequently, our study evaluated the contextual features of protein sequences obtained from a pretrained protein large language model leveraging bidirectional LSTM and GRU to predict amyloidogenic regions in peptide and protein sequences. Our method achieved an accuracy of 84.5% on 10-fold cross-validation and an accuracy of 83% in the test dataset. Our results demonstrate competitive performance, highlighting the potential of LLMs in enhancing the accuracy of amyloid prediction.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to train a model collaboratively without sharing local data. A key distinction between FL and centralized learning is that clients' data are non-independent and identically distributed, which poses significant challenges in training a global model that generalizes well across heterogeneous local data distributions. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of overparameterized FedAvg with gradient descent (GD). We prove that the impact of data heterogeneity diminishes as the width of neural networks increases, ultimately vanishing when the width approaches infinity. In the infinite-width regime, we further prove that both the global and local models in FedAvg behave as linear models, and that FedAvg achieves the same generalization performance as centralized learning with the same number of GD iterations. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical findings across various network architectures, loss functions, and optimization methods.

arXiv:2508.12590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the growing demand for on-device LLM inference in resource-constrained environments, hybrid language models (HLM) have emerged, combining lightweight local models with powerful cloud-based LLMs. Recent studies on HLM have primarily focused on improving accuracy and latency, while often overlooking communication and energy efficiency. We propose a token-level filtering mechanism for an energy-efficient importance- and uncertainty-aware HLM inference that leverages both epistemic uncertainty and attention-based importance. Our method opportunistically uploads only informative tokens, reducing LLM usage and communication costs. Experiments with TinyLlama-1.1B and LLaMA-2-7B demonstrate that our method achieves up to 87.5% BERT Score and token throughput of 0.37 tokens/sec while saving the energy consumption by 40.7% compared to standard HLM. Furthermore, compared to our previous U-HLM baseline, our method improves BERTScore from 85.8% to 87.0%, energy savings from 31.6% to 43.6%, and throughput from 0.36 to 0.40. This approach enables an energy-efficient and accurate deployment of LLMs in bandwidth-constrained edge environments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic state estimation (TSE) fundamentally involves solving high-dimensional spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs) governing traffic flow dynamics from limited, noisy measurements. While Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) enforce PDE constraints point-wise, this paper adopts a physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet) framework that reformulates TSE as an operator learning problem. Our approach trains a parameterized neural operator that maps sparse input data to the full spatiotemporal traffic state field, governed by the traffic flow conservation law. Crucially, unlike PINNs that enforce PDE constraints point-wise, PI-DeepONet integrates traffic flow conservation model and the fundamental diagram directly into the operator learning process, ensuring physical consistency while capturing congestion propagation, spatial correlations, and temporal evolution. Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals insights into optimal function generation strategies and branch network complexity. Additionally, the impact of input function generation methods and the number of functions on model performance is explored, highlighting the robustness and efficacy of proposed framework.

arXiv:2508.12594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention limits its applicability and scalability on large unstructured meshes. We introduce Fast Low-rank Attention Routing Engine (FLARE), a linear complexity self-attention mechanism that routes attention through fixed-length latent sequences. Each attention head performs global communication among $N$ tokens by projecting the input sequence onto a fixed length latent sequence of $M \ll N$ tokens using learnable query tokens. By routing attention through a bottleneck sequence, FLARE learns a low-rank form of attention that can be applied at $O(NM)$ cost. FLARE not only scales to unprecedented problem sizes, but also delivers superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art neural PDE surrogates across diverse benchmarks. We also release a new additive manufacturing dataset to spur further research. Our code is available at https://github.com/vpuri3/FLARE.py.

Abstract: Design of neural networks that incorporate symmetry is crucial for geometric deep learning. Central to this effort is the development of invariant and equivariant operations. This works presents a systematic method for constructing valid invariant and equivariant operations. It can handle inputs and outputs in the form of Cartesian tensors with different rank, as well as spherical tensors with different types. In addition, our method features a graphical representation utilizing the symmetric tensor network, which simplifies both the proofs and constructions related to invariant and equivariant functions. We also apply this approach to design the equivariant interaction message for the geometry graph neural network, and equivariant machine learning model to learn the constitutive law of materials.

arXiv:2508.12602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid surrogate model for electric vehicle parameter estimation and power consumption. We combine our novel architecture Spectral Parameter Operator built on a Fourier Neural Operator backbone for global context and a differentiable physics module in the forward pass. From speed and acceleration alone, it outputs time-varying motor and regenerative braking efficiencies, as well as aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, effective mass, and auxiliary power. These parameters drive a physics-embedded estimate of battery power, eliminating any separate physics-residual loss. The modular design lets representations converge to physically meaningful parameters that reflect the current state and condition of the vehicle. We evaluate on real-world logs from a Tesla Model 3, Tesla Model S, and the Kia EV9. The surrogate achieves a mean absolute error of 0.2kW (about 1% of average traction power at highway speeds) for Tesla vehicles and about 0.8kW on the Kia EV9. The framework is interpretable, and it generalizes well to unseen conditions, and sampling rates, making it practical for path optimization, eco-routing, on-board diagnostics, and prognostics health management.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has proven effective in further enhancing the performance of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). However, mainstream post-training methods (i.e., reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning) often incur substantial computational overhead due to auxiliary models and overthinking. In this paper, we empirically reveal that the incorrect answers partially stem from verbose reasoning processes lacking correct self-fix, where errors accumulate across multiple reasoning steps. To this end, we propose Self-traced Step-wise Preference Optimization (SSPO), a pluggable RL process supervision framework that enables fine-grained optimization of each reasoning step. Specifically, SSPO requires neither auxiliary models nor stepwise manual annotations. Instead, it leverages step-wise preference signals generated by the model itself to guide the optimization process for reasoning compression. Experiments demonstrate that the generated reasoning sequences from SSPO are both accurate and succinct, effectively mitigating overthinking behaviors without compromising model performance across diverse domains and languages.

<title>How can we trust opaque systems? Criteria for robust explanations in XAI</title>

arXiv:2508.12623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) algorithms are becoming ubiquitous in everyday life and in scientific research. However, the price we pay for their impressively accurate predictions is significant: their inner workings are notoriously opaque - it is unknown to laypeople and researchers alike what features of the data a DL system focuses on and how it ultimately succeeds in predicting correct outputs. A necessary criterion for trustworthy explanations is that they should reflect the relevant processes the algorithms' predictions are based on. The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) presents promising methods to create such explanations. But recent reviews about their performance offer reasons for skepticism. As we will argue, a good criterion for trustworthiness is explanatory robustness: different XAI methods produce the same explanations in comparable contexts. However, in some instances, all methods may give the same, but still wrong, explanation. We therefore argue that in addition to explanatory robustness (ER), a prior requirement of explanation method robustness (EMR) has to be fulfilled by every XAI method. Conversely, the robustness of an individual method is in itself insufficient for trustworthiness. In what follows, we develop and formalize criteria for ER as well as EMR, providing a framework for explaining and establishing trust in DL algorithms. We also highlight interesting application cases and outline directions for future work.

Abstract: A generative model capable of sampling realistic molecules with desired properties could accelerate chemical discovery across a wide range of applications. Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing models that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure. We present FlowMol3, an open-source, multi-modal flow matching model that advances the state of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial performance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes to the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching formulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three architecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost: self-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion. FlowMol3 achieves nearly 100% molecular validity for drug-like molecules with explicit hydrogens, more accurately reproduces the functional group composition and geometry of its training data, and does so with an order of magnitude fewer learnable parameters than comparable methods. We hypothesize that these techniques mitigate a general pathology affecting transport-based generative models, enabling detection and correction of distribution drift during inference. Our results highlight simple, transferable strategies for improving the stability and quality of diffusion- and flow-based molecular generative models.

<title>Score-informed Neural Operator for Enhancing Ordering-based Causal Discovery</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordering-based approaches to causal discovery identify topological orders of causal graphs, providing scalable alternatives to combinatorial search methods. Under the Additive Noise Model (ANM) assumption, recent causal ordering methods based on score matching require an accurate estimation of the Hessian diagonal of the log-densities. However, previous approaches mainly use Stein gradient estimators, which are computationally expensive and memory-intensive. Although DiffAN addresses these limitations by substituting kernel-based estimates with diffusion models, it remains numerically unstable due to the second-order derivatives of score models. To alleviate these problems, we propose Score-informed Neural Operator (SciNO), a probabilistic generative model in smooth function spaces designed to stably approximate the Hessian diagonal and to preserve structural information during the score modeling. Empirical results show that SciNO reduces order divergence by 42.7% on synthetic graphs and by 31.5% on real-world datasets on average compared to DiffAN, while maintaining memory efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we propose a probabilistic control algorithm for causal reasoning with autoregressive models that integrates SciNO's probability estimates with autoregressive model priors, enabling reliable data-driven causal ordering informed by semantic information. Consequently, the proposed method enhances causal reasoning abilities of LLMs without additional fine-tuning or prompt engineering.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing private data. We consider FL scenarios wherein FL clients are subject to adversarial (Byzantine) attacks, while the FL server is trusted (honest) and has a trustworthy side dataset. This may correspond to, e.g., cases where the server possesses trusted data prior to federation, or to the presence of a trusted client that temporarily assumes the server role. Our approach requires only two honest participants, i.e., the server and one client, to function effectively, without prior knowledge of the number of malicious clients. Theoretical analysis demonstrates bounded optimality gaps even under strong Byzantine attacks. Experimental results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms standard and robust FL baselines such as Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum under various attack strategies including label flipping, sign flipping, and Gaussian noise addition across MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 benchmarks using the Flower framework.

<title>Deploying Models to Non-participating Clients in Federated Learning without Fine-tuning: A Hypernetwork-based Approach</title>

arXiv:2508.12673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving collaborative learning, yet data heterogeneity remains a critical challenge. While existing methods achieve progress in addressing data heterogeneity for participating clients, they fail to generalize to non-participating clients with in-domain distribution shifts and resource constraints. To mitigate this issue, we present HyperFedZero, a novel method that dynamically generates specialized models via a hypernetwork conditioned on distribution-aware embeddings. Our approach explicitly incorporates distribution-aware inductive biases into the model's forward pass, extracting robust distribution embeddings using a NoisyEmbed-enhanced extractor with a Balancing Penalty, effectively preventing feature collapse. The hypernetwork then leverages these embeddings to generate specialized models chunk-by-chunk for non-participating clients, ensuring adaptability to their unique data distributions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate HyperFedZero's remarkable performance, surpassing competing methods consistently with minimal computational, storage, and communication overhead. Moreover, ablation studies and visualizations further validate the necessity of each component, confirming meaningful adaptations and validating the effectiveness of HyperFedZero.

Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) can improve data-driven modeling of building thermal dynamics. Therefore, many new TL research areas emerge in the field, such as selecting the right source model for TL. However, these research directions require massive amounts of thermal building data which is lacking presently. Neither public datasets nor existing data generators meet the needs of TL research in terms of data quality and quantity. Moreover, existing data generation approaches typically require expert knowledge in building simulation. We present BuilDa, a thermal building data generation framework for producing synthetic data of adequate quality and quantity for TL research. The framework does not require profound building simulation knowledge to generate large volumes of data. BuilDa uses a single-zone Modelica model that is exported as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) and simulated in Python. We demonstrate BuilDa by generating data and utilizing it for pretraining and fine-tuning TL models.

Abstract: Connected and automated vehicles generate vast amounts of sensor data daily, raising significant privacy and communication challenges for centralized machine learning approaches in perception tasks. This study presents a decentralized, federated learning framework tailored for traffic sign detection in vehicular networks to enable collaborative model training without sharing raw data. The framework partitioned traffic sign classes across vehicles for specialized local training using lightweight object detectors, aggregated model parameters via algorithms like FedProx, FedAdam and FedAVG in a simulated environment with the Flower framework, and evaluated multiple configurations including varying server rounds, local epochs, client participation fractions, and data distributions. Experiments demonstrated that increasing server rounds from 2 to 20 boosted accuracy from below 0.1 to over 0.8, moderate local epochs (8-10) provided optimal efficiency with accuracies around 0.67, higher client participation fractions enhanced generalization up to 0.83, FedProx outperformed other aggregators in handling heterogeneity, non-IID data distributions reduced performance compared to IID, and training duration primarily scaled with the number of rounds rather than aggregation strategy. We conclude that this federated approach may offer a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for real-world vehicular deployments, potentially guiding future integrations of robust aggregation and communication optimizations to advance intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FFT) of large language models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a promising solution to enable domain-specific adaptation while preserving data privacy. Despite its benefits, FFT on resource-constrained clients relies on the high computational and memory demands of full-model fine-tuning, which limits the potential advancement. This paper presents FedSODA, a resource-efficient FFT framework that enables clients to adapt LLMs without accessing or storing the full model. Specifically, we first propose a similarity group pruning (SGP) module, which prunes redundant layers from the full LLM while retaining the most critical layers to preserve the model performance. Moreover, we introduce an orchestrated distillation alignment (ODA) module to reduce gradient divergence between the sub-LLM and the full LLM during FFT. Through the use of the QLoRA, clients only need to deploy quantized sub-LLMs and fine-tune lightweight adapters, significantly reducing local resource requirements. We conduct extensive experiments on three open-source LLMs across a variety of downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that FedSODA reduces communication overhead by an average of 70.6%, decreases storage usage by 75.6%, and improves task accuracy by 3.1%, making it highly suitable for practical FFT applications under resource constraints.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing local data. However, most existing methods assume identical model architectures across clients, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous real-world environments. To address this, we propose FedUNet, a lightweight and architecture-agnostic FL framework that attaches a U-Net-inspired additive module to each client's backbone. By sharing only the compact bottleneck of the U-Net, FedUNet enables efficient knowledge transfer without structural alignment. The encoder-decoder design and skip connections in the U-Net help capture both low-level and high-level features, facilitating the extraction of clientinvariant representations. This enables cooperative learning between the backbone and the additive module with minimal communication cost. Experiment with VGG variants shows that FedUNet achieves 93.11% accuracy and 92.68% in compact form (i.e., a lightweight version of FedUNet) with only 0.89 MB low communication overhead.

Abstract: This paper presents preliminary results in the definition of a comprehensive benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate spatial reasoning capabilities in neural networks, with a particular focus on morphological properties such as connectivity and distance relationships. The framework is currently being used to study the capabilities of nnU-Net, exploiting the spatial model checker VoxLogicA to generate two distinct categories of synthetic datasets: maze connectivity problems for topological analysis and spatial distance computation tasks for geometric understanding. Each category is evaluated across multiple resolutions to assess scalability and generalization properties. The automated pipeline encompasses a complete machine learning workflow including: synthetic dataset generation, standardized training with cross-validation, inference execution, and comprehensive evaluation using Dice coefficient and IoU (Intersection over Union) metrics. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate significant challenges in neural network spatial reasoning capabilities, revealing systematic failures in basic geometric and topological understanding tasks. The framework provides a reproducible experimental protocol, enabling researchers to identify specific limitations. Such limitations could be addressed through hybrid approaches combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning methods for improved spatial understanding in clinical applications, establishing a foundation for ongoing research into neural network spatial reasoning limitations and potential solutions.

<title>Constrained Centroid Clustering: A Novel Approach for Compact and Structured Partitioning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12758</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Constrained Centroid Clustering (CCC), a method that extends classical centroid-based clustering by enforcing a constraint on the maximum distance between the cluster center and the farthest point in the cluster. Using a Lagrangian formulation, we derive a closed-form solution that maintains interpretability while controlling cluster spread. To evaluate CCC, we conduct experiments on synthetic circular data with radial symmetry and uniform angular distribution. Using ring-wise, sector-wise, and joint entropy as evaluation metrics, we show that CCC achieves more compact clusters by reducing radial spread while preserving angular structure, outperforming standard methods such as K-means and GMM. The proposed approach is suitable for applications requiring structured clustering with spread control, including sensor networks, collaborative robotics, and interpretable pattern analysis.

<title>Short-Term Forecasting of Energy Production and Consumption Using Extreme Learning Machine: A Comprehensive MIMO based ELM Approach</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12764</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12764</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel methodology for short-term energy forecasting using an Extreme Learning Machine ($\mathtt{ELM}$) is proposed. Using six years of hourly data collected in Corsica (France) from multiple energy sources (solar, wind, hydro, thermal, bioenergy, and imported electricity), our approach predicts both individual energy outputs and total production (\cyr{including imports, which closely follow energy demand, modulo losses)} through a Multi-Input Multi-Output ($\mathtt{MIMO}$) architecture. To address non-stationarity and seasonal variability, sliding window techniques and cyclic time encoding are incorporated, enabling dynamic adaptation to fluctuations. The $\mathtt{ELM}$ model significantly outperforms persistence-based forecasting, particularly for solar and thermal energy, achieving an $\mathtt{nRMSE}$ of $17.9\%$ and $5.1\%$, respectively, with $\mathtt{R^2} > 0.98$ (1-hour horizon). The model maintains high accuracy up to five hours ahead, beyond which renewable energy sources become increasingly volatile. While $\mathtt{MIMO}$ provides marginal gains over Single-Input Single-Output ($\mathtt{SISO}$) architectures and offers key advantages over deep learning methods such as $\mathtt{LSTM}$, it provides a closed-form solution with lower computational demands, making it well-suited for real-time applications, including online learning. Beyond predictive accuracy, the proposed methodology is adaptable to various contexts and datasets, as it can be tuned to local constraints such as resource availability, grid characteristics, and market structures.

<title>Online Ensemble Transformer for Accurate Cloud Workload Forecasting in Predictive Auto-Scaling</title>

Abstract: In the swiftly evolving domain of cloud computing, the advent of serverless systems underscores the crucial need for predictive auto-scaling systems. This necessity arises to ensure optimal resource allocation and maintain operational efficiency in inherently volatile environments. At the core of a predictive auto-scaling system is the workload forecasting model. Existing forecasting models struggle to quickly adapt to the dynamics in online workload streams and have difficulty capturing the complex periodicity brought by fine-grained, high-frequency forecasting tasks. Addressing this, we propose a novel online ensemble model, E3Former, for online workload forecasting in large-scale predictive auto-scaling. Our model synergizes the predictive capabilities of multiple subnetworks to surmount the limitations of single-model approaches, thus ensuring superior accuracy and robustness. Remarkably, it accomplishes this with a minimal increase in computational overhead, adhering to the lean operational ethos of serverless systems. Through extensive experimentation on real-world workload datasets, we establish the efficacy of our ensemble model. In online forecasting tasks, the proposed method reduces forecast error by an average of 10%, and its effectiveness is further demonstrated through a predictive auto-scaling test in the real-life online system. Currently, our method has been deployed within ByteDance's Intelligent Horizontal Pod Auto-scaling (IHPA) platform, which supports the stable operation of over 30 applications, such as Douyin E-Comerce, TouTiao, and Volcano Engine. The predictive auto-scaling capacity reaching over 600,000 CPU cores. On the basis of essentially ensuring service quality, the predictive auto-scaling system can reduce resource utilization by over 40%.

Abstract: We propose a novel unsupervised outlier detection method based on Randomized Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Inspired by the performance of Randomized PCA (RPCA) Forest in approximate K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search, we develop a novel unsupervised outlier detection method that utilizes RPCA Forest for outlier detection. Experimental results showcase the superiority of the proposed approach compared to the classical and state-of-the-art methods in performing the outlier detection task on several datasets while performing competitively on the rest. The extensive analysis of the proposed method reflects it high generalization power and its computational efficiency, highlighting it as a good choice for unsupervised outlier detection.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). However, deep transformer models often suffer from an over-smoothing issue, in which token representations converge to similar values as they pass through successive transformer blocks. In this paper, we establish an equivalence between the hidden-state dynamics induced by stacked attention layers and graph neural diffusion on a complete graph. From this perspective, over-smoothing can be interpreted as a consequence of the dissipative nature of the underlying diffusion dynamics. Motivated by this physical interpretation, we propose Wavy Transformer, which consists of a novel attention layer based on second-order wavy dynamics. We also introduce a feed-forward network and a normalization layer designed to preserve the physical state-velocity relationship under the chain rule, thereby extending the transformer architecture. We further validate our proposed techniques on various transformer models for NLP and CV tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that Wavy Transformer improves performance with minimal additional parameters and no extra hyperparameter tuning.

<title>Bridging Human and LLM Judgments: Understanding and Narrowing the Gap</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used as judges (LLM-as-a-judge) to evaluate model outputs at scale, but their assessments often diverge systematically from human judgments. We present Bridge, a unified statistical framework that explicitly bridges human and LLM evaluations under both absolute scoring and pairwise comparison paradigms. Bridge posits a latent human preference score for each prompt-response pair and models LLM deviations as linear transformations of covariates that capture sources of discrepancies. This offers a simple and principled framework for refining LLM ratings and characterizing systematic discrepancies between humans and LLMs. We provide an efficient fitting algorithm with asymptotic guarantees for statistical inference. Using six LLM judges and two benchmarks (BigGen Bench and Chatbot Arena), Bridge achieves higher agreement with human ratings (accuracy, calibration, and KL divergence) and exposes systematic human-LLM gaps.

<title>Maximum Score Routing For Mixture-of-Experts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routing networks in sparsely activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) dynamically allocate input tokens to top-k experts through differentiable sparse transformations, enabling scalable model capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Traditional MoE networks impose an expert capacity constraint to ensure GPU-friendly computation. However, this leads to token dropping when capacity is saturated and results in low hardware efficiency due to padding in underutilized experts. Removing the capacity constraint, in turn, compromises load balancing and computational efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Maximum Score Routing ($\mathbf{MaxScore}$), a novel MoE routing paradigm that models routing as a minimum-cost maximum-flow problem and integrates a SoftTopk operator. MaxScore resolves the fundamental limitations of iterative rerouting and optimal transport formulations, achieving lower training losses and higher evaluation scores at equivalent FLOPs compared to both constrained and unconstrained baselines. Implementation details and experimental configurations can be obtained from $\href{https://github.com/dongbw18/MaxScore.git}{MaxScore}$.

<title>Learning to Steer: Input-dependent Steering for Multimodal LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12815</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12815</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steering has emerged as a practical approach to enable post-hoc guidance of LLMs towards enforcing a specific behavior. However, it remains largely underexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering techniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied independently of the input query. This paradigm faces limitations when the desired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe answer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal activity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert when asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained steering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using contrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts required for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to train a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector. Our approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces hallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static baselines.

arXiv:2508.12833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-device machine learning is often constrained by limited storage, particularly in continuous data collection scenarios. This paper presents an empirical study on storage-aware learning, focusing on the trade-off between data quantity and quality via compression. We demonstrate that naive strategies, such as uniform data dropping or one-size-fits-all compression, are suboptimal. Our findings further reveal that data samples exhibit varying sensitivities to compression, supporting the feasibility of a sample-wise adaptive compression strategy. These insights provide a foundation for developing a new class of storage-aware learning systems. The primary contribution of this work is the systematic characterization of this under-explored challenge, offering valuable insights that advance the understanding of storage-aware learning.

Abstract: Motivated by empirical observations of prolonged plateaus and stage-wise progression during training, we investigate the loss landscape of transformer models trained on in-context next-token prediction tasks. In particular, we focus on learning in-context $n$-gram language models under cross-entropy loss, and establish a sufficient condition for parameter configurations to be stationary points. We then construct a set of parameter configurations for a simplified transformer model that represent $k$-gram estimators (for $k \leq n$), and show that the gradient of the population loss at these solutions vanishes in the limit of infinite sequence length and parameter norm. This reveals a key property of the loss landscape: {sub-$n$-grams are near-stationary points of the population cross-entropy loss}, offering theoretical insight into widely observed phenomena such as stage-wise learning dynamics and emergent phase transitions. These insights are further supported by numerical experiments that illustrate the learning dynamics of $n$-grams, characterized by discrete transitions between near-stationary solutions.

<title>HRS: Hybrid Representation Framework with Scheduling Awareness for Time Series Forecasting in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms</title>

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of streaming services, network load exhibits highly time-varying and bursty behavior, posing serious challenges for maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms (CCPs). While CCPs leverage Predict-then-Schedule architecture to improve QoS and profitability, accurate load forecasting remains challenging under traffic surges. Existing methods either minimize mean absolute error, resulting in underprovisioning and potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations during peak periods, or adopt conservative overprovisioning strategies, which mitigate SLA risks at the expense of increased resource expenditure. To address this dilemma, we propose HRS, a hybrid representation framework with scheduling awareness that integrates numerical and image-based representations to better capture extreme load dynamics. We further introduce a Scheduling-Aware Loss (SAL) that captures the asymmetric impact of prediction errors, guiding predictions that better support scheduling decisions. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that HRS consistently outperforms ten baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing SLA violation rates by 63.1% and total profit loss by 32.3%.

Abstract: With the growing digitalization all over the globe, the relevance of network security becomes increasingly important. Machine learning-based intrusion detection constitutes a promising approach for improving security, but it bears several challenges. These include the requirement to detect novel and unseen network events, as well as specific data properties, such as events over time together with the inherent graph structure of network communication. In this work, we propose a novel intrusion detection method, TGN-SVDD, which builds upon modern dynamic graph modelling and deep anomaly detection. We demonstrate its superiority over several baselines for realistic intrusion detection data and suggest a more challenging variant of the latter.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce TCUQ, a single pass, label free uncertainty monitor for streaming TinyML that converts short horizon temporal consistency captured via lightweight signals on posteriors and features into a calibrated risk score with an O(W ) ring buffer and O(1) per step updates. A streaming conformal layer turns this score into a budgeted accept/abstain rule, yielding calibrated behavior without online labels or extra forward passes. On microcontrollers, TCUQ fits comfortably on kilobyte scale devices and reduces footprint and latency versus early exit and deep ensembles (typically about 50 to 60% smaller and about 30 to 45% faster), while methods of similar accuracy often run out of memory. Under corrupted in distribution streams, TCUQ improves accuracy drop detection by 3 to 7 AUPRC points and reaches up to 0.86 AUPRC at high severities; for failure detection it attains up to 0.92 AUROC. These results show that temporal consistency, coupled with streaming conformal calibration, provides a practical and resource efficient foundation for on device monitoring in TinyML.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for sparse tensor algebra (SpTA) in machine learning and big data has driven the development of various sparse tensor accelerators. However, most existing manually designed accelerators are limited to specific scenarios, and it's time-consuming and challenging to adjust a large number of design factors when scenarios change. Therefore, automating the design of SpTA accelerators is crucial. Nevertheless, previous works focus solely on either mapping (i.e., tiling communication and computation in space and time) or sparse strategy (i.e., bypassing zero elements for efficiency), leading to suboptimal designs due to the lack of comprehensive consideration of both. A unified framework that jointly optimizes both is urgently needed. However, integrating mapping and sparse strategies leads to a combinatorial explosion in the design space(e.g., as large as $O(10^{41})$ for the workload $P_{32 \times 64} \times Q_{64 \times 48} = Z_{32 \times 48}$). This vast search space renders most conventional optimization methods (e.g., particle swarm optimization, reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search) inefficient. To address this challenge, we propose an evolution strategy-based sparse tensor accelerator optimization framework, called SparseMap. SparseMap constructing a more comprehensive design space with the consideration of both mapping and sparse strategy. We introduce a series of enhancements to genetic encoding and evolutionary operators, enabling SparseMap to efficiently explore the vast and diverse design space. We quantitatively compare SparseMap with prior works and classical optimization methods, demonstrating that SparseMap consistently finds superior solutions.

arXiv:2508.12907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce \textbf{SNAP-UQ}, a single-pass, label-free uncertainty method for TinyML that estimates risk from \emph{depth-wise next-activation prediction}: tiny int8 heads forecast the statistics of the next layer from a compressed view of the previous one, and a lightweight monotone mapper turns the resulting surprisal into an actionable score. The design requires no temporal buffers, auxiliary exits, or repeated forward passes, and adds only a few tens of kilobytes to MCU deployments. Across vision and audio backbones, SNAP-UQ consistently reduces flash and latency relative to early-exit and deep ensembles (typically $\sim$40--60\% smaller and $\sim$25--35\% faster), with competing methods of similar accuracy often exceeding memory limits. In corrupted streams it improves accuracy-drop detection by several AUPRC points and maintains strong failure detection (AUROC $\approx$0.9) in a single pass. Grounding uncertainty in layer-to-layer dynamics yields a practical, resource-efficient basis for on-device monitoring in TinyML.

Abstract: We propose Fed-DPRoC, a novel federated learning framework that simultaneously ensures differential privacy (DP), Byzantine robustness, and communication efficiency. We introduce the concept of robust-compatible compression, which enables users to compress DP-protected updates while maintaining the robustness of the aggregation rule. We instantiate our framework as RobAJoL, combining the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform for compression with robust averaging for robust aggregation. We theoretically prove the compatibility of JL transform with robust averaging and show that RobAJoL preserves robustness guarantees, ensures DP, and reduces communication cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST validate our theoretical claims and demonstrate that RobAJoL outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness and utility under different Byzantine attacks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.12984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of neural networks poses a significant barrier to the deployment of distributed machine learning (ML) on resource-constrained devices, such as federated learning (FL). Split learning (SL) offers a promising solution by offloading the primary computing load from edge devices to a server via model partitioning. However, as the number of participating devices increases, the transmission of excessive smashed data (i.e., activations and gradients) becomes a major bottleneck for SL, slowing down the model training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a communication-efficient SL framework, named SL-ACC, which comprises two key components: adaptive channel importance identification (ACII) and channel grouping compression (CGC). ACII first identifies the contribution of each channel in the smashed data to model training using Shannon entropy. Following this, CGC groups the channels based on their entropy and performs group-wise adaptive compression to shrink the transmission volume without compromising training accuracy. Extensive experiments across various datasets validate that our proposed SL-ACC framework takes considerably less time to achieve a target accuracy than state-of-the-art benchmarks.

arXiv:2508.12993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common observation in the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) literature is that stacking GCN layers may or may not result in better performance on tasks like node classification and edge prediction. We have found empirically that a graph's algebraic connectivity, which is known as the Fiedler value, is a good predictor of GCN performance. Intuitively, graphs with similar Fiedler values have analogous structural properties, suggesting that the same filters and hyperparameters may yield similar results when used with GCNs, and that transfer learning may be more effective between graphs with similar algebraic connectivity. We explore this theoretically and empirically with experiments on synthetic and real graph data, including the Cora, CiteSeer and Polblogs datasets. We explore multiple ways of aggregating the Fiedler value for connected components in the graphs to arrive at a value for the entire graph, and show that it can be used to predict GCN performance. We also present theoretical arguments as to why the Fiedler value is a good predictor.

arXiv:2508.12996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer neural networks are increasingly used for physics-based problems. In data-driven PDE surrogates, training samples from varying boundary and initial conditions can cause erratic losses and spiky gradients; in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), stiff composite losses amplify this effect.
  We introduce Kourkoutas-Beta, an Adam-style optimizer where the fixed second-moment discount beta2 is replaced by a layer-wise dynamic value driven by a bounded ``sunspike'' ratio: the current pooled gradient norm divided by an exponential moving average (EMA) of past norms, squashed to the interval [0,1). Spikes lower beta2 toward beta2_min; calm phases keep it near beta2_max. Options include leaky-AMSGrad (decay), trust-region clipping (max_ratio), adaptive tiny terms, and several bias-correction modes ``none'', ``beta2max'', ``exact'). With all features off and bias_correction=``none'', the method is exactly Adam.
  We test on four settings: (i) a Transformer PDE surrogate (Heat2D), (ii) a 3D PINN for heat conduction (Heat3D), (iii) a lightweight MLX synthetic task with jitter and rare-trigger bursts, and (iv) a character-level Transformer on 30 MB of enwik8 (small-enwik8). Kourkoutas-Beta improves stability and final loss versus fixed-beta2 Adam. On small-enwik8 it lowers bits-per-character by about 38% vs Adam-0.95 and about 58% vs Adam-0.999 over 10 seeds, with smaller variance. The method remains drop-in, with runtime overhead comparable to Adam in testbeds A-C and within single-digit percent in testbed D. It preserves Adam-style convergence guarantees while improving robustness under spiky gradients.

Abstract: Multi-view evidential learning aims to integrate information from multiple views to improve prediction performance and provide trustworthy uncertainty esitimation. Most previous methods assume that view-specific evidence learning is naturally reliable. However, in practice, the evidence learning process tends to be biased. Through empirical analysis on real-world data, we reveal that samples tend to be assigned more evidence to support data-rich classes, thereby leading to unreliable uncertainty estimation in predictions. This motivates us to delve into a new Biased Evidential Multi-view Learning (BEML) problem. To this end, we propose Fairness-Aware Multi-view Evidential Learning (FAML). FAML first introduces an adaptive prior based on training trajectory, which acts as a regularization strategy to flexibly calibrate the biased evidence learning process. Furthermore, we explicitly incorporate a fairness constraint based on class-wise evidence variance to promote balanced evidence allocation. In the multi-view fusion stage, we propose an opinion alignment mechanism to mitigate view-specific bias across views, thereby encouraging the integration of consistent and mutually supportive evidence. Extensive experiments on five real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate that FAML achieves more balanced evidence allocation and improves both prediction performance and the reliability of uncertainty estimation compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is crucial for the adaptation of neural network models to new environments. Although outperforming weight-space regularisation approaches, the functional regularisation-based CL methods suffer from high computational costs and large linear approximation errors. In this work, we present a new functional regularisation CL framework, called MCFRCL, which approximates model prediction distributions by Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. Moreover, three continuous distributions are leveraged to capture the statistical characteristics of the MC samples via moment-based methods. Additionally, both the Wasserstein distance and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance are employed to construct the regularisation function. The proposed MCFRCL is evaluated against multiple benchmark methods on the MNIST and CIFAR datasets, with simulation results highlighting its effectiveness in both prediction accuracy and training efficiency.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a robust adaptive filtering approach for active noise control applications in the presence of impulsive noise. In particular, we develop the filtered-x hyperbolic tangent exponential generalized Kernel M-estimate function (FXHEKM) robust adaptive algorithm. A statistical analysis of the proposed FXHEKM algorithm is carried out along with a study of its computational cost. {In order to evaluate the proposed FXHEKM algorithm, the mean-square error (MSE) and the average noise reduction (ANR) performance metrics have been adopted.} Numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed FXHEKM algorithm to cancel the presence of the additive spurious signals, such as \textbf{$\alpha$}-stable noises against competing algorithms.

Abstract: Cyberattacks are increasing, and securing against such threats is costing industries billions of dollars annually. Threat Modeling, that is, comprehending the consequences of these attacks, can provide critical support to cybersecurity professionals, enabling them to take timely action and allocate resources that could be used elsewhere. Cybersecurity is heavily dependent on threat modeling, as it assists security experts in assessing and mitigating risks related to identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Recently, there has been a pressing need for automated methods to assess attack descriptions and forecast the future consequences of the increasing complexity of cyberattacks. This study examines how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning can be applied to analyze the potential impact of cyberattacks by leveraging textual descriptions from the MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database. We emphasize classifying attack consequences into five principal categories: Availability, Access Control, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Other. This paper investigates the use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in combination with Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs) for Multi-label classification, evaluating their performance in comparison with conventional CNN and LSTM-based models. Experimental findings show that BERT achieves an overall accuracy of $0.972$, far higher than conventional deep learning models in multi-label classification. HAN outperforms baseline forms of CNN and LSTM-based models on specific cybersecurity labels. However, BERT consistently achieves better precision and recall, making it more suitable for predicting the consequences of a cyberattack.

<title>Beyond Internal Data: Bounding and Estimating Fairness from Incomplete Data</title>

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in AI systems is critical, especially in high-stakes domains such as lending, hiring, and healthcare. This urgency is reflected in emerging global regulations that mandate fairness assessments and independent bias audits. However, procuring the necessary complete data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge. In industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data. In practice, data relevant for fairness testing is often split across separate sources: internal datasets held by institutions with predictive attributes, and external public datasets such as census data containing protected attributes, each providing only partial, marginal information. Our work seeks to leverage such available separate data to estimate model fairness when complete data is inaccessible. We propose utilising the available separate data to estimate a set of feasible joint distributions and then compute the set plausible fairness metrics. Through simulation and real experiments, we demonstrate that we can derive meaningful bounds on fairness metrics and obtain reliable estimates of the true metric. Our results demonstrate that this approach can serve as a practical and effective solution for fairness testing in real-world settings where access to complete data is restricted.

<title>Hierarchical Evaluation Function (HEF): A Multi-Metric Approach for Optimizing Demand Forecasting Models</title>

Abstract: Demand forecasting is essential for strategic planning in competitive environments, enabling resource optimization and improved responsiveness to market dynamics. However, multivariate time series modeling faces challenges due to data complexity, uncertainty, and frequent regime shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics can introduce biases and limit generalization. This work compares two custom evaluation functions: FMAE (Focused Mean Absolute Error), focused on minimizing absolute errors, and HEF (Hierarchical Evaluation Function), designed to weight global metrics and penalize large deviations. Experiments were conducted under different data splits (91:9, 80:20, 70:30) using three optimizers (Grid Search, PSO, Optuna), assessing fit, relative accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Results show that HEF consistently outperforms FMAE in global metrics (R2, Relative Accuracy, RMSE, RMSSE), enhancing model robustness and explanatory power. These findings were confirmed via visualizations and statistical tests. Conversely, FMAE offers advantages in local metrics (MAE, MASE) and execution time, making it suitable for short-term scenarios. The study highlights a methodological trade-off: HEF is ideal for strategic planning, while FMAE is better suited for operational efficiency. A replicable framework is proposed for optimizing predictive models in dynamic environments.

<title>Seeing the Many: Exploring Parameter Distributions Conditioned on Features in Surrogates</title>

Abstract: Recently, neural surrogate models have emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional simulation workflows. This is accomplished by modeling the underlying function of scientific simulations, removing the need to run expensive simulations. Beyond just mapping from input parameter to output, surrogates have also been shown useful for inverse problems: output to input parameters. Inverse problems can be understood as search, where we aim to find parameters whose surrogate outputs contain a specified feature. Yet finding these parameters can be costly, especially for high-dimensional parameter spaces. Thus, existing surrogate-based solutions primarily focus on finding a small set of matching parameters, in the process overlooking the broader picture of plausible parameters. Our work aims to model and visualize the distribution of possible input parameters that produce a given output feature. To achieve this goal, we aim to address two challenges: (1) the approximation error inherent in the surrogate model and (2) forming the parameter distribution in an interactive manner. We model error via density estimation, reporting high density only if a given parameter configuration is close to training parameters, measured both over the input and output space. Our density estimate is used to form a prior belief on parameters, and when combined with a likelihood on features, gives us an efficient way to sample plausible parameter configurations that generate a target output feature. We demonstrate the usability of our solution through a visualization interface by performing feature-driven parameter analysis over the input parameter space of three simulation datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for classifying and detecting spatial commission outliers in maritime environments using seabed acoustic sensor networks and log Gaussian Cox processes (LGCPs). By modeling target arrivals as a mixture of normal and outlier processes, we estimate the probability that a newly observed event is an outlier. We propose a second-order approximation of this probability that incorporates both the mean and variance of the normal intensity function, providing improved classification accuracy compared to mean-only approaches. We analytically show that our method yields a tighter bound to the true probability using Jensen's inequality. To enhance detection, we integrate a real-time, near-optimal sensor placement strategy that dynamically adjusts sensor locations based on the evolving outlier intensity. The proposed framework is validated using real ship traffic data near Norfolk, Virginia, where numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving both classification performance and outlier detection through sensor deployment.

<title>A Perfectly Truthful Calibration Measure</title>

Abstract: Calibration requires that predictions are conditionally unbiased and, therefore, reliably interpretable as probabilities. Calibration measures quantify how far a predictor is from perfect calibration. As introduced by Haghtalab et al. (2024), a calibration measure is truthful if it is minimized in expectation when a predictor outputs the ground-truth probabilities. Although predicting the true probabilities guarantees perfect calibration, in reality, when calibration is evaluated on a finite sample, predicting the truth is not guaranteed to minimize any known calibration measure. All known calibration measures incentivize predictors to lie in order to appear more calibrated on a finite sample. Such lack of truthfulness motivated Haghtalab et al. (2024) and Qiao and Zhao (2025) to construct approximately truthful calibration measures in the sequential prediction setting, but no perfectly truthful calibration measure was known to exist even in the more basic batch setting.
  We design a perfectly truthful calibration measure in the batch setting: averaged two-bin calibration error (ATB). In addition to being truthful, ATB is sound, complete, continuous, and quadratically related to two existing calibration measures: the smooth calibration error (smCal) and the (lower) distance to calibration (distCal). The simplicity in our definition of ATB makes it efficient and straightforward to compute. ATB allows faster estimation algorithms with significantly easier implementations than smCal and distCal, achieving improved running time and simplicity for the calibration testing problem studied by Hu et al. (2024). We also introduce a general recipe for constructing truthful measures, which proves the truthfulness of ATB as a special case and allows us to construct other truthful calibration measures such as quantile-binned l_2-ECE.

<title>Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer -- Towards Foundational Digital Twins in Process Industry</title>

Abstract: Foundational modelling of multi-dimensional time-series data in industrial systems presents a central trade-off: channel-dependent (CD) models capture specific cross-variable dynamics but lack robustness and adaptability as model layers are commonly bound to the data dimensionality of the tackled use-case, while channel-independent (CI) models offer generality at the cost of modelling the explicit interactions crucial for system-level predictive regression tasks. To resolve this, we propose the Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer (CGPT), a novel architecture that integrates a known causal graph as an inductive bias. The core of CGPT is built around a pairwise modeling paradigm, tackling the CD/CI conflict by decomposing the multidimensional data into pairs. The model uses channel-agnostic learnable layers where all parameter dimensions are independent of the number of variables. CGPT enforces a CD information flow at the pair-level and CI-like generalization across pairs. This approach disentangles complex system dynamics and results in a highly flexible architecture that ensures scalability and any-variate adaptability. We validate CGPT on a suite of synthetic and real-world industrial datasets on long-term and one-step forecasting tasks designed to simulate common industrial complexities. Results demonstrate that CGPT significantly outperforms both CI and CD baselines in predictive accuracy and shows competitive performance with end-to-end trained CD models while remaining agnostic to the problem dimensionality.

Abstract: In classical AI, perception relies on learning state-based representations, while planning, which can be thought of as temporal reasoning over action sequences, is typically achieved through search. We study whether such reasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both perceptual and temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning, despite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure due to its reliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Combinatorial Representations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative sampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate temporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex temporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube. In particular, for the Rubik's Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial states and allow it to solve the puzzle using fewer search steps than BestFS, though with longer solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that efficiently solves arbitrary Cube states using only learned representations, without relying on an external search algorithm.

<title>Training Machine Learning Models on Human Spatio-temporal Mobility Data: An Experimental Study [Experiment Paper]</title>

Abstract: Individual-level human mobility prediction has emerged as a significant topic of research with applications in infectious disease monitoring, child, and elderly care. Existing studies predominantly focus on the microscopic aspects of human trajectories: such as predicting short-term trajectories or the next location visited, while offering limited attention to macro-level mobility patterns and the corresponding life routines. In this paper, we focus on an underexplored problem in human mobility prediction: determining the best practices to train a machine learning model using historical data to forecast an individuals complete trajectory over the next days and weeks. In this experiment paper, we undertake a comprehensive experimental analysis of diverse models, parameter configurations, and training strategies, accompanied by an in-depth examination of the statistical distribution inherent in human mobility patterns. Our empirical evaluations encompass both Long Short-Term Memory and Transformer-based architectures, and further investigate how incorporating individual life patterns can enhance the effectiveness of the prediction. We show that explicitly including semantic information such as day-of-the-week and user-specific historical information can help the model better understand individual patterns of life and improve predictions. Moreover, since the absence of explicit user information is often missing due to user privacy, we show that the sampling of users may exacerbate data skewness and result in a substantial loss in predictive accuracy. To mitigate data imbalance and preserve diversity, we apply user semantic clustering with stratified sampling to ensure that the sampled dataset remains representative. Our results further show that small-batch stochastic gradient optimization improves model performance, especially when human mobility training data is limited.

<title>MDPO: Overcoming the Training-Inference Divide of Masked Diffusion Language Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion language models, as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive (AR) models, enable faster generation and richer conditioning on bidirectional context. However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between training and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the structure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens, whereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random. Although this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal performance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing this gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the problem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential decision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement learning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to exploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model under the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches the performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer gradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and 54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight updates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in inference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine tokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we refer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains when combined with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for investigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/autonomousvision/mdpo.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of tightening the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) approximations of data sets in arbitrary dimensions. The MILP formulation leverages the difference-of-convex (DC) representation of CPWL functions. We introduce the concept of well-behaved CPWL interpolations and demonstrate that any CPWL interpolation of a data set has a well-behaved version. This result is critical to tighten the MILP problem. We present six different strategies to tighten the problem, which include fixing the values of some variables, introducing additional constraints, identifying small big-M parameter values and applying tighter variable bounds. These methods leverage key aspects of the DC representation and the inherent structure of well-behaved CPWL interpolations. Experimental results demonstrate that specific combinations of these tightening strategies lead to significant improvement in solution times, especially for tightening strategies that consider well-behaved CPWL solutions.

Abstract: The deployment of dense, low-cost sensors is critical for realizing ubiquitous smart environments. However, existing sensing solutions struggle with the energy, scalability, and reliability trade-offs imposed by battery maintenance, wireless transmission overhead, and data processing complexity. In this work, we present Vibe2Spike, a novel battery-free, wireless sensing framework that enables vibration-based activity recognition using visible light communication (VLC) and spiking neural networks (SNNs). Our system uses ultra-low-cost tags composed only of a piezoelectric disc, a Zener diode, and an LED, which harvest vibration energy and emit sparse visible light spikes without requiring batteries or RF radios. These optical spikes are captured by event cameras and classified using optimized SNN models evolved via the EONS framework. We evaluate Vibe2Spike across five device classes, achieving 94.9\% average classification fitness while analyzing the latency-accuracy trade-offs of different temporal binning strategies. Vibe2Spike demonstrates a scalable, and energy-efficient approach for enabling intelligent environments in a batteryless manner.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible and energy-efficient framework for temporal information processing. However, existing studies overlook a fundamental property widely observed in biological neurons-synaptic heterogeneity, which plays a crucial role in temporal processing and cognitive capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce HetSyn, a generalized framework that models synaptic heterogeneity with synapse-specific time constants. This design shifts temporal integration from the membrane potential to the synaptic current, enabling versatile timescale integration and allowing the model to capture diverse synaptic dynamics. We implement HetSyn as HetSynLIF, an extended form of the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model equipped with synapse-specific decay dynamics. By adjusting the parameter configuration, HetSynLIF can be specialized into vanilla LIF neurons, neurons with threshold adaptation, and neuron-level heterogeneous models. We demonstrate that HetSynLIF not only improves the performance of SNNs across a variety of tasks-including pattern generation, delayed match-to-sample, speech recognition, and visual recognition-but also exhibits strong robustness to noise, enhanced working memory performance, efficiency under limited neuron resources, and generalization across timescales. In addition, analysis of the learned synaptic time constants reveals trends consistent with empirical observations in biological synapses. These findings underscore the significance of synaptic heterogeneity in enabling efficient neural computation, offering new insights into brain-inspired temporal modeling.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for over 30% of global deaths according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Importantly, one-third of these deaths are preventable with timely and accurate diagnosis. The electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive method for recording the electrical activity of the heart, is crucial for diagnosing CVDs. However, privacy concerns surrounding the use of patient ECG data in research have spurred interest in synthetic data, which preserves the statistical properties of real data without compromising patient confidentiality. This study explores the potential of synthetic ECG data for training deep learning models from regression to classification tasks and evaluates the feasibility of transfer learning to enhance classification performance on real ECG data. We experimented with popular deep learning models to predict four key cardiac parameters, namely, Heart Rate (HR), PR interval, QT interval, and QRS complex-using separate regression models. Subsequently, we leveraged these regression models for transfer learning to perform 5-class ECG signal classification. Our experiments systematically investigate whether transfer learning from regression to classification is viable, enabling better utilization of diverse open-access and synthetic ECG datasets. Our findings demonstrate that transfer learning from regression to classification improves classification performance, highlighting its potential to maximize the utility of available data and advance deep learning applications in this domain.

Abstract: Objective: Sparse Bayesian learning provides an effective scheme to solve the high-dimensional problem in brain signal decoding. However, traditional assumptions regarding data distributions such as Gaussian and binomial are potentially inadequate to characterize the noisy signals of brain activity. Hence, this study aims to propose a robust sparse Bayesian learning framework to address noisy highdimensional brain activity decoding. Methods: Motivated by the commendable robustness of the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion for handling complex data distributions, we proposed an MEE-based likelihood function to facilitate the accurate inference of sparse Bayesian learning in analyzing noisy brain datasets. Results: Our proposed approach was evaluated using two high-dimensional brain decoding tasks in regression and classification contexts, respectively. The experimental results showed that, our approach can realize superior decoding metrics and physiological patterns than the conventional and state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion: Utilizing the proposed MEE-based likelihood model, sparse Bayesian learning is empowered to simultaneously address the challenges of noise and high dimensionality in the brain decoding task. Significance: This work provides a powerful tool to realize robust brain decoding, advancing biomedical engineering applications such as brain-computer interface.

Abstract: Brain-like intelligent systems need brain-like learning methods. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically plausible learning framework with strong potential for brain-inspired computing hardware. However, existing im-plementations of EP suffer from instability and prohibi-tively high computational costs. Inspired by the structure and dynamics of the brain, we propose a biologically plau-sible Feedback-regulated REsidual recurrent neural network (FRE-RNN) and study its learning performance in EP framework. Feedback regulation enables rapid convergence by reducing the spectral radius. The improvement in con-vergence property reduces the computational cost and train-ing time of EP by orders of magnitude, delivering perfor-mance on par with backpropagation (BP) in benchmark tasks. Meanwhile, residual connections with brain-inspired topologies help alleviate the vanishing gradient problem that arises when feedback pathways are weak in deep RNNs. Our approach substantially enhances the applicabil-ity and practicality of EP in large-scale networks that un-derpin artificial intelligence. The techniques developed here also offer guidance to implementing in-situ learning in physical neural networks.

Abstract: Affective computing is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary research direction in the field of brain-computer interface. In recent years, the introduction of deep learning technology has greatly promoted the development of the field of emotion recognition. However, due to physiological differences between subjects, as well as the variations in experimental environments and equipment, cross-corpus emotion recognition faces serious challenges, especially for samples near the decision boundary. To solve the above problems, we propose an optimization method based on domain adversarial transfer learning to fine-grained alignment of affective features, named Maximum classifier discrepancy with Pairwise Learning (McdPL) framework. In McdPL, we design a dual adversarial classifier (Ada classifier and RMS classifier), and apply a three-stage adversarial training to maximize classification discrepancy and minimize feature distribution to align controversy samples near the decision boundary. In the process of domain adversarial training, the two classifiers also maintain an adversarial relationship, ultimately enabling precise cross-corpus feature alignment. In addition, the introduction of pairwise learning transforms the classification problem of samples into a similarity problem between samples, alleviating the influence of label noise. We conducted systematic experimental evaluation of the model using publicly available SEED, SEED-IV and SEED-V databases. The results show that the McdPL model is superior to other baseline models in the cross-corpus emotion recognition task, and the average accuracy improvements of 4.76\% and 3.97\%, respectively. Our work provides a promising solution for emotion recognition cross-corpus. The source code is available at https://github.com/WuCB-BCI/Mcd_PL.

<title>Energy-Efficient Real-Time 4-Stage Sleep Classification at 10-Second Resolution: A Comprehensive Study</title>

Abstract: Sleep stage classification is crucial for diagnosing and managing disorders such as sleep apnea and insomnia. Conventional clinical methods like polysomnography are costly and impractical for long-term home use. We present an energy-efficient pipeline that detects four sleep stages (wake, REM, light, and deep) from a single-lead ECG. Two windowing strategies are introduced: (1) a 5-minute window with 30-second steps for machine-learning models that use handcrafted features, and (2) a 30-second window with 10-second steps for deep-learning models, enabling near-real-time 10-second resolution. Lightweight networks such as MobileNet-v1 reach 92 percent accuracy and 91 percent F1-score but still draw significant energy. We therefore design SleepLiteCNN, a custom model that achieves 89 percent accuracy and 89 percent F1-score while lowering energy use to 5.48 microjoules per inference at 45 nm. Applying eight-bit quantization preserves accuracy and further reduces power, and FPGA deployment confirms low resource usage. The proposed system offers a practical solution for continuous, wearable ECG-based sleep monitoring.

Abstract: The limitations of unimodal deep learning models, particularly their tendency to overfit and limited generalizability, have renewed interest in multimodal fusion strategies. Multimodal deep neural networks (MDNN) have the capability of integrating diverse data domains and offer a promising solution for robust and accurate predictions. However, the optimal fusion strategy, intermediate fusion (feature-level) versus late fusion (decision-level) remains insufficiently examined, especially in high-stakes clinical contexts such as ECG-based cardiovascular disease (CVD) classification. This study investigates the comparative effectiveness of intermediate and late fusion strategies using ECG signals across three domains: time, frequency, and time-frequency. A series of experiments were conducted to identify the highest-performing fusion architecture. Results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperformed late fusion, achieving a peak accuracy of 97 percent, with Cohen's d > 0.8 relative to standalone models and d = 0.40 compared to late fusion. Interpretability analyses using saliency maps reveal that both models align with the discretized ECG signals. Statistical dependency between the discretized ECG signals and corresponding saliency maps for each class was confirmed using Mutual Information (MI). The proposed ECG domain-based multimodal model offers superior predictive capability and enhanced explainability, crucial attributes in medical AI applications, surpassing state-of-the-art models.

<title>Revealing Neurocognitive and Behavioral Patterns by Unsupervised Manifold Learning from Dynamic Brain Data</title>

Abstract: Dynamic brain data, teeming with biological and functional insights, are becoming increasingly accessible through advanced measurements, providing a gateway to understanding the inner workings of the brain in living subjects. However, the vast size and intricate complexity of the data also pose a daunting challenge in reliably extracting meaningful information across various data sources. This paper introduces a generalizable unsupervised deep manifold learning for exploration of neurocognitive and behavioral patterns. Unlike existing methods that extract patterns directly from the input data as in the existing methods, the proposed Brain-dynamic Convolutional-Network-based Embedding (BCNE) seeks to capture the brain-state trajectories by deciphering the temporospatial correlations within the data and subsequently applying manifold learning to this correlative representation. The performance of BCNE is showcased through the analysis of several important dynamic brain datasets. The results, both visual and quantitative, reveal a diverse array of intriguing and interpretable patterns. BCNE effectively delineates scene transitions, underscores the involvement of different brain regions in memory and narrative processing, distinguishes various stages of dynamic learning processes, and identifies differences between active and passive behaviors. BCNE provides an effective tool for exploring general neuroscience inquiries or individual-specific patterns.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that utilizes the internal weight activations of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct a metric space of languages. Unlike traditional approaches based on hand-crafted linguistic features, our method automatically derives high-dimensional vector representations by computing weight importance scores via an adapted pruning algorithm. Our approach captures intrinsic language characteristics that reflect linguistic phenomena. We validate our approach across diverse datasets and multilingual LLMs, covering 106 languages. The results align well with established linguistic families while also revealing unexpected inter-language connections that may indicate historical contact or language evolution. The source code, computed language latent vectors, and visualization tool are made publicly available at https://github.com/mshamrai/deep-language-geometry.

Abstract: Non-invasive glucose monitoring remains a critical challenge in the management of diabetes. HRV during sleep shows promise for glucose prediction however, age-related autonomic changes significantly confound traditional HRV analyses. We analyzed 43 subjects with multi-modal data including sleep-stage specific ECG, HRV features, and clinical measurements. A novel age-normalization technique was applied to the HRV features by, dividing the raw values by age-scaled factors. BayesianRidge regression with 5-fold cross-validation was employed for log-glucose prediction. Age-normalized HRV features achieved R2 = 0.161 (MAE = 0.182) for log-glucose prediction, representing a 25.6% improvement over non-normalized features (R2 = 0.132). The top predictive features were hrv rem mean rr age normalized (r = 0.443, p = 0.004), hrv ds mean rr age normalized (r = 0.438, p = 0.005), and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.437, p = 0.005). Systematic ablation studies confirmed age-normalization as the critical component, with sleep-stage specific features providing additional predictive value. Age-normalized HRV features significantly enhance glucose prediction accuracy compared with traditional approaches. This sleep-aware methodology addresses fundamental limitations in autonomic function assessment and suggests a preliminary feasibility for non-invasive glucose monitoring applications. However, these results require validation in larger cohorts before clinical consideration.

Abstract: Objective: This study proposes and preliminarily validates a novel "Functional-Energetic Topology Model" to uncover neurodynamic mechanisms of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI), using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to decode brain network patterns from single-channel EEG in real-world settings.Methods: EEG data were collected over ~1 month from three adolescents with NSSI using a smartphone app and a portable Fp1 EEG headband during impulsive and non-impulsive states. A theory-driven GNN with seven functional nodes was built. Performance was evaluated via intra-subject (80/20 split) and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSOCV). GNNExplainer was used for interpretability.Results: The model achieved high intra-subject accuracy (>85%) and significantly above-chance cross-subject performance (approximately73.7%). Explainability analysis revealed a key finding: during NSSI states, a critical feedback loop regulating somatic sensation exhibits dysfunction and directional reversal. Specifically, the brain loses its ability to self-correct via negative bodily feedback, and the regulatory mechanism enters an "ineffective idling" state.Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying theory-guided GNNs to sparse, single-channel EEG for decoding complex mental states. The identified "feedback loop reversal" offers a novel, dynamic, and computable model of NSSI mechanisms, paving the way for objective biomarkers and next-generation Digital Therapeutics (DTx).

Abstract: Corrosion poses a significant challenge to the performance of aluminum alloys, particularly in marine environments. This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict and optimize corrosion resistance, utilizing a comprehensive open-source dataset compiled from various sources. The dataset encompasses corrosion rate data and environmental conditions, preprocessed to standardize units and formats. We explored two different approaches, a direct approach, where the material's composition and environmental conditions were used as inputs to predict corrosion rates; and an inverse approach, where corrosion rate served as the input to identify suitable material compositions as output. We employed and compared three distinct ML methodologies for forward predictions: Random Forest regression, optimized via grid search; a feed-forward neural network, utilizing ReLU activation and Adam optimization; and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), implemented with GPyTorch and employing various kernel functions. The Random Forest and neural network models provided predictive capabilities based on elemental compositions and environmental conditions. Notably, Gaussian Process Regression demonstrated superior performance, particularly with hybrid kernel functions. Log-transformed GPR further refined predictions. This study highlights the efficacy of ML, particularly GPR, in predicting corrosion rates and material properties.

Abstract: EEG-based analysis of pain perception, enhanced by machine learning, reveals how the brain encodes pain by identifying neural patterns evoked by noxious stimulation. However, a major challenge that remains is the generalization of machine learning models across individuals, given the high cross-participant variability inherent to EEG signals and the limited focus on direct pain perception identification in current research. In this study, we systematically evaluate the performance of cross-participant generalization of a wide range of models, including traditional classifiers and deep neural classifiers for identifying the sensory modality of thermal pain and aversive auditory stimulation from EEG recordings. Using a novel dataset of EEG recordings from 108 participants, we benchmark model performance under both within- and cross-participant evaluation settings. Our findings show that traditional models suffered the largest drop from within- to cross-participant performance, while deep learning models proved more resilient, underscoring their potential for subject-invariant EEG decoding. Even though performance variability remained high, the strong results of the graph-based model highlight its potential to capture subject-invariant structure in EEG signals. On the other hand, we also share the preprocessed dataset used in this study, providing a standardized benchmark for evaluating future algorithms under the same generalization constraints.

Abstract: Track Circuits (TC) are the main signalling devices used to detect the presence of a train on a rail track. It has been used since the 19th century and nowadays there are many types depending on the technology. As a general classification, Track Circuits can be divided into 2 main groups, DC (Direct Current) and AC (Alternating Current) circuits. This work is focused on a particular AC track circuit, called "Smart Train Detection System" (STDS), designed with both high and low-frequency bands. This approach uses STDS current data applied to an SVM (support vector machine) classifier as a type of failure identifier. The main purpose of this work consists on determine automatically which is the component of the track that is failing to improve the maintenance action. Model was trained to classify 15 different failures that belong to 3 more general categories. The method was tested with field data from 10 different track circuits and validated by the STDS track circuit expert and maintainers. All use cases were correctly classified by the method.

Abstract: Algorithmic discovery has traditionally relied on human ingenuity and extensive experimentation. Here we investigate whether a prominent scientific computing algorithm, the Kalman Filter, can be discovered through an automated, data-driven, evolutionary process that relies on Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) and Large Language Models (LLM). We evaluate the contributions of both modalities (CGP and LLM) in discovering the Kalman filter under varying conditions. Our results demonstrate that our framework of CGP and LLM-assisted evolution converges to near-optimal solutions when Kalman optimality assumptions hold. When these assumptions are violated, our framework evolves interpretable alternatives that outperform the Kalman filter. These results demonstrate that combining evolutionary algorithms and generative models for interpretable, data-driven synthesis of simple computational modules is a potent approach for algorithmic discovery in scientific computing.

Abstract: The Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm has gained significant attention in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and is the foundation of many recent algorithms. However, decentralized policies operate under partial observability and often yield suboptimal performance compared to centralized policies, while fully centralized approaches typically face scalability challenges as the number of agents increases.
  We propose Centralized Permutation Equivariant (CPE) learning, a centralized training and execution framework that employs a fully centralized policy to overcome these limitations. Our approach leverages a novel permutation equivariant architecture, Global-Local Permutation Equivariant (GLPE) networks, that is lightweight, scalable, and easy to implement. Experiments show that CPE integrates seamlessly with both value decomposition and actor-critic methods, substantially improving the performance of standard CTDE algorithms across cooperative benchmarks including MPE, SMAC, and RWARE, and matching the performance of state-of-the-art RWARE implementations.

Abstract: GraphQL's flexibility, while beneficial for efficient data fetching, introduces unique security vulnerabilities that traditional API security mechanisms often fail to address. Malicious GraphQL queries can exploit the language's dynamic nature, leading to denial-of-service attacks, data exfiltration through injection, and other exploits. Existing solutions, such as static analysis, rate limiting, and general-purpose Web Application Firewalls, offer limited protection against sophisticated, context-aware attacks. This paper presents a novel, AI-driven approach for real-time detection of malicious GraphQL queries. Our method combines static analysis with machine learning techniques, including Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic schema-based configuration, Sentence Transformers (SBERT and Doc2Vec) for contextual embedding of query payloads, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Random Forests, and Multilayer Perceptrons for classification. We detail the system architecture, implementation strategies optimized for production environments (including ONNX Runtime optimization and parallel processing), and evaluate the performance of our detection models and the overall system under load. Results demonstrate high accuracy in detecting various threats, including SQL injection, OS command injection, and XSS exploits, alongside effective mitigation of DoS and SSRF attempts. This research contributes a robust and adaptable solution for enhancing GraphQL API security.

Abstract: We present Ovis2.5, a successor to Ovis2 designed for native-resolution visual perception and strong multimodal reasoning. Ovis2.5 integrates a native-resolution vision transformer that processes images at their native, variable resolutions, avoiding the degradation from fixed-resolution tiling and preserving both fine detail and global layout -- crucial for visually dense content like complex charts. To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to move beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including self-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional "thinking mode" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced accuracy on difficult inputs. The model is trained via a comprehensive five-phase curriculum that progressively builds its skills. The process begins with foundational visual and multimodal pretraining, advances through large-scale instruction tuning, and culminates in alignment and reasoning enhancement using DPO and GRPO. To scale these upgrades efficiently, we employ multimodal data packing and hybrid parallelism, yielding a significant end-to-end speedup. We release two open-source models: Ovis2.5-9B and Ovis2.5-2B. The latter continues the "small model, big performance" philosophy of Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios. On the OpenCompass multimodal leaderboard, Ovis2.5-9B averages 78.3, marking a substantial improvement over its predecessor, Ovis2-8B, and achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs in the sub-40B parameter range; Ovis2.5-2B scores 73.9, establishing SOTA for its size. Beyond aggregate scores, Ovis2.5 achieves leading results on STEM benchmarks, exhibits strong capabilities on grounding and video tasks, and achieves open-source SOTA at its scale for complex chart analysis.

Abstract: Improved computational power has enabled different disciplines to predict causal relationships among modeled variables using Bayesian network inference. While many alternative algorithms have been proposed to improve the efficiency and reliability of network prediction, the predicted causal networks reflect the generative process but also bear an opaque imprint of the specific computational algorithm used. Following a ``wisdom of the crowds" strategy, we developed an ensemble learning approach to marginalize the impact of a single algorithm on Bayesian causal network inference. To introduce the approach, we first present the theoretical foundation of this framework. Next, we present a comprehensive implementation of the framework in terms of a new software tool called BaMANI (Bayesian Multi-Algorithm causal Network Inference). Finally, we describe a BaMANI use-case from biology, particularly within human breast cancer studies.

Abstract: Imitation learning is a proven method for creating a policy in the absence of rewards, by leveraging expert demonstrations. In this work, we apply imitation learning to conversation. In doing so, we recover a policy capable of talking to a user given a prompt (input state), and a discriminator capable of classifying between expert and synthetic conversation. While our policy is effective, we recover results from our discriminator that indicate the limitations of dialog models. We argue that this technique can be used to identify adverse behavior of arbitrary data models common for dialog oriented tasks.

Abstract: Effective Question Answering (QA) on large biomedical document collections requires effective document retrieval techniques. The latter remains a challenging task due to the domain-specific vocabulary and semantic ambiguity in user queries. We propose BMQExpander, a novel ontology-aware query expansion pipeline that combines medical knowledge - definitions and relationships - from the UMLS Metathesaurus with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance retrieval effectiveness. We implemented several state-of-the-art baselines, including sparse and dense retrievers, query expansion methods, and biomedical-specific solutions. We show that BMQExpander has superior retrieval performance on three popular biomedical Information Retrieval (IR) benchmarks: NFCorpus, TREC-COVID, and SciFact - with improvements of up to 22.1% in NDCG@10 over sparse baselines and up to 6.5% over the strongest baseline. Further, BMQExpander generalizes robustly under query perturbation settings, in contrast to supervised baselines, achieving up to 15.7% improvement over the strongest baseline. As a side contribution, we publish our paraphrased benchmarks. Finally, our qualitative analysis shows that BMQExpander has fewer hallucinations compared to other LLM-based query expansion baselines.

Abstract: This study investigates whether second-order geometric cues - planar curvature magnitude, curvature sign, and gradient orientation - are sufficient on their own to drive a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for handwritten character recognition (HCR), offering an alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using these three handcrafted feature maps as inputs, our curvature-orientation MLP achieves 97 percent accuracy on MNIST digits and 89 percent on EMNIST letters. These results underscore the discriminative power of curvature-based representations for handwritten character images and demonstrate that the advantages of deep learning can be realized even with interpretable, hand-engineered features.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning has demonstrated significant improvements in large language models and vision language models, yet its potential for audio language models remains largely unexplored. In this technical report, we take a preliminary step towards closing this gap. For better assessment of sound reasoning, we propose AF-Reasoning-Eval, a benchmark targeting common-sense reasoning and the ability to discriminate among closely related choices. To prepare training corpus for sound reasoning abilities, we propose automatic pipelines that transform existing audio question answering and classification data into explicit reasoning chains, yielding AF-CoT-Train with 1.24M samples. We study the effect of finetuning Audio Flamingo series on AF-CoT-Train and observe considerable improvements on several reasoning benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of chain-of-thought finetuning on advanced sound understanding.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful approach for graph-based machine learning tasks. Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived graph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or anomaly detection. These transformations include segmenting images, extracting features from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness of the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge construction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and shape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to perform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on dermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance and efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised regimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute the best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features consistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised configuration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805 without relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches. With the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to 0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.

<title>What Matters for Bioacoustic Encoding</title>

Abstract: Bioacoustics, the study of sounds produced by living organisms, plays a vital role in conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and behavioral studies. Many tasks in this field, such as species, individual, and behavior classification and detection, are well-suited to machine learning. However, they often suffer from limited annotated data, highlighting the need for a general-purpose bioacoustic encoder capable of extracting useful representations for diverse downstream tasks. Such encoders have been proposed before, but are often limited in scope due to a focus on a narrow range of species (typically birds), and a reliance on a single model architecture or training paradigm. Moreover, they are usually evaluated on a small set of tasks and datasets. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical study that covers aspects of bioacoustics that are relevant to research but have previously been scarcely considered: training data diversity and scale, model architectures and training recipes, and the breadth of evaluation tasks and datasets. We obtain encoders that are state-of-the-art on the existing and proposed benchmarks. We also identify what matters for training these encoders, such that this work can be extended when more data are available or better architectures are proposed. Specifically, across 26 datasets with tasks including species classification, detection, individual ID, and vocal repertoire discovery, we find self-supervised pre-training followed by supervised post-training on a mixed bioacoustics + general-audio corpus yields the strongest in- and out-of-distribution performance. We show the importance of data diversity in both stages. To support ongoing research and application, we will release the model checkpoints.

Abstract: We propose a method for evaluating the robustness of a widely used LLM ranking system -- the Bradley--Terry ranking system -- to dropping a worst-case very small fraction of evaluation data. Our approach is computationally fast and easy to adopt. When we apply our method to matchups from two popular human-preference platforms, Chatbot Arena and MT-Bench, we find that the Bradley--Terry rankings of top-performing models are remarkably sensitive to the removal of a small fraction of evaluations. Our framework also identifies the specific evaluations most responsible for such ranking flips, allowing for inspections of these influential preferences. We observe that the rankings derived from MT-Bench preferences are notably more robust than those from Chatbot Arena, likely due to MT-bench's use of expert annotators and carefully constructed prompts. Finally, we find that rankings based on crowdsourced human-evaluated systems are just as sensitive as those based on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations, where in both, dropping as little as 0.02% of the total evaluations in the dataset can change the top-ranked model.

Abstract: Studying adversarial robustness of quantum machine learning (QML) models is essential in order to understand their potential advantages over classical models and build trustworthy systems. Distributing QML models allows leveraging multiple quantum processors to overcome the limitations of individual devices and build scalable systems. However, this distribution can affect their adversarial robustness, potentially making them more vulnerable to new attacks. Key paradigms in distributed QML include federated learning, which, similar to classical models, involves training a shared model on local data and sending only the model updates, as well as circuit distribution methods inherent to quantum computing, such as circuit cutting and teleportation-based techniques. These quantum-specific methods enable the distributed execution of quantum circuits across multiple devices. This work reviews the differences between these distribution methods, summarizes existing approaches on the adversarial robustness of QML models when distributed using each paradigm, and discusses open questions in this area.

Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains rapid adoption in safety-critical tasks for efficient novel-view synthesis from static images, how might an adversary tamper images to cause harm? We introduce ComplicitSplat, the first attack that exploits standard 3DGS shading methods to create viewpoint-specific camouflage - colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed adversarial content in scene objects that are visible only from specific viewpoints and without requiring access to model architecture or weights. Our extensive experiments show that ComplicitSplat generalizes to successfully attack a variety of popular detector - both single-stage, multi-stage, and transformer-based models on both real-world capture of physical objects and synthetic scenes. To our knowledge, this is the first black-box attack on downstream object detectors using 3DGS, exposing a novel safety risk for applications like autonomous navigation and other mission-critical robotic systems.

Abstract: Tokenization remains a fundamental yet underexplored bottleneck in natural language processing, with strategies largely static despite remarkable progress in model architectures. We present SupraTok, a novel tokenization architecture that reimagines subword segmentation through three innovations: cross-boundary pattern learning that discovers multi-word semantic units, entropy-driven data curation that optimizes training corpus quality, and multi-phase curriculum learning for stable convergence. Our approach extends Byte-Pair Encoding by learning "superword" tokens, coherent multi-word expressions that preserve semantic unity while maximizing compression efficiency. SupraTok achieves 31% improvement in English tokenization efficiency (5.91 versus 4.51 characters per token) compared to OpenAI's o200k tokenizer and 30% improvement over Google's Gemma 3 tokenizer (256k vocabulary), while maintaining competitive performance across 38 languages. When integrated with a GPT-2 scale model (124M parameters) trained on 10 billion tokens from the FineWeb-Edu dataset, SupraTok yields 8.4% improvement on HellaSWAG and 9.5% on MMLU benchmarks without architectural modifications. While these results are promising at this scale, further validation at larger model scales is needed. These findings suggest that efficient tokenization can complement architectural innovations as a path to improved language model performance.

<title>On Balancing Sparsity with Reliable Connectivity in Distributed Network Design with Random K-out Graphs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11863</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.11863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In several applications in distributed systems, an important design criterion is ensuring that the network is sparse, i.e., does not contain too many edges, while achieving reliable connectivity. Sparsity ensures communication overhead remains low, while reliable connectivity is tied to reliable communication and inference on decentralized data reservoirs and computational resources. A class of network models called random K-out graphs appear widely as a heuristic to balance connectivity and sparsity, especially in settings with limited trust, e.g., privacy-preserving aggregation of networked data in which networks are deployed. However, several questions remain regarding how to choose network parameters in response to different operational requirements, including the need to go beyond asymptotic results and the ability to model the stochastic and adversarial environments. To address this gap, we present theorems to inform the choice of network parameters that guarantee reliable connectivity in regimes where nodes can be finite or unreliable. We first derive upper and lower bounds for probability of connectivity in random K-out graphs when the number of nodes is finite. Next, we analyze the property of r-robustness, a stronger notion than connectivity that enables resilient consensus in the presence of malicious nodes. Finally, motivated by aggregation mechanisms based on pairwise masking, we model and analyze the impact of a subset of adversarial nodes, modeled as deletions, on connectivity and giant component size - metrics that are closely tied to privacy guarantees. Together, our results pave the way for end-to-end performance guarantees for a suite of algorithms for reliable inference on networks.

Abstract: In practical teaching, we observe that few students thoroughly read or fully comprehend the information provided in traditional, text-based course syllabi. As a result, essential details, such as course policies and learning outcomes, are frequently overlooked. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel approach leveraging AI-generated singing and virtual avatars to present syllabi in a format that is more visually appealing, engaging, and memorable. Especially, we leveraged the open-source tool, HeyGem, to transform textual syllabi into audiovisual presentations, in which digital avatars perform the syllabus content as songs. The proposed approach aims to stimulate students' curiosity, foster emotional connection, and enhance retention of critical course information. Student feedback indicated that AI-sung syllabi significantly improved awareness and recall of key course information.

<title>EVTP-IVS: Effective Visual Token Pruning For Unifying Instruction Visual Segmentation In Multi-Modal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Instructed Visual Segmentation (IVS) tasks require segmenting objects in images or videos based on natural language instructions. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on IVS, their inference cost remains a major bottleneck, particularly in video. We empirically analyze visual token sampling in MLLMs and observe a strong correlation between subset token coverage and segmentation performance. This motivates our design of a simple and effective token pruning method that selects a compact yet spatially representative subset of tokens to accelerate inference. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual token pruning method for IVS, called EVTP-IV, which builds upon the k-center by integrating spatial information to ensure better coverage. We further provide an information-theoretic analysis to support our design. Experiments on standard IVS benchmarks show that our method achieves up to 5X speed-up on video tasks and 3.5X on image tasks, while maintaining comparable accuracy using only 20% of the tokens. Our method also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning baselines under varying pruning ratios.

Abstract: We revisit the classical Sobel operator to ask a simple question: Are first-order edge maps sufficient to drive an all-dense multilayer perceptron (MLP) for handwritten character recognition (HCR), as an alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs)? Using only horizontal and vertical Sobel derivatives as input, we train an MLP on MNIST and EMNIST Letters. Despite its extreme simplicity, the resulting network reaches 98% accuracy on MNIST digits and 92% on EMNIST letters -- approaching CNNs while offering a smaller memory footprint and transparent features. Our findings highlight that much of the class-discriminative information in handwritten character images is already captured by first-order gradients, making edge-aware MLPs a compelling option for HCR.

arXiv:2508.11911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel data-driven symplectic induced-order modeling (ROM) framework for high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems that unifies latent-space discovery and dynamics learning within a single, end-to-end neural architecture. The encoder-decoder is built from Henon neural networks (HenonNets) and may be augmented with linear SGS-reflector layers. This yields an exact symplectic map between full and latent phase spaces. Latent dynamics are advanced by a symplectic flow map implemented as a HenonNet. This unified neural architecture ensures exact preservation of the underlying symplectic structure at the reduced-order level, significantly enhancing the fidelity and long-term stability of the resulting ROM. We validate our method through comprehensive numerical experiments on canonical Hamiltonian systems. The results demonstrate the method's capability for accurate trajectory reconstruction, robust predictive performance beyond the training horizon, and accurate Hamiltonian preservation. These promising outcomes underscore the effectiveness and potential applicability of our symplectic ROM framework for complex dynamical systems across a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines.

Abstract: Game-theoretic interactions between agents with Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed many emergent capabilities, yet the linguistic diversity of these interactions has not been sufficiently quantified. In this paper, we present the Conversational Robustness Evaluation Score: CORE, a metric to quantify the effectiveness of language use within multi-agent systems across different game-theoretic interactions. CORE integrates measures of cluster entropy, lexical repetition, and semantic similarity, providing a direct lens of dialog quality. We apply CORE to pairwise LLM dialogs across competitive, cooperative, and neutral settings, further grounding our analysis in Zipf's and Heaps' Laws to characterize word frequency distributions and vocabulary growth. Our findings show that cooperative settings exhibit both steeper Zipf distributions and higher Heap exponents, indicating more repetition alongside greater vocabulary expansion. In contrast, competitive interactions display lower Zipf and Heaps exponents, reflecting less repetition and more constrained vocabularies. These results provide new insights into how social incentives influence language adaptation, and highlight CORE as a robust diagnostic for measuring linguistic robustness in multi-agent LLM systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/psyonp/core.

Abstract: The need for detecting LLM-generated code necessitates watermarking systems capable of operating within its highly structured and syntactically constrained environment. To address this, we introduce CodeTracer, an innovative adaptive code watermarking framework underpinned by a novel reinforcement learning training paradigm. At its core, CodeTracer features a policy-driven approach that utilizes a parameterized model to intelligently bias token choices during next-token prediction. This strategy ensures that embedded watermarks maintain code functionality while exhibiting subtle yet statistically detectable deviations from typical token distributions. To facilitate policy learning, we devise a comprehensive reward system that seamlessly integrates execution feedback with watermark embedding signals, balancing process-level and outcome-level rewards. Additionally, we employ Gumbel Top-k reparameterization to enable gradient-based optimization of discrete watermarking decisions. Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate CodeTracer's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in both watermark detectability and the preservation of generated code's functionality.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) are efficient alternatives to traditional sequence models, excelling at processing long sequences with lower computational complexity. Their reliance on matrix multiplications makes them ideal for compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures, which improve energy efficiency by computing within memory arrays. However, device non-idealities in CIM introduce weight perturbations that can degrade inference accuracy. In this paper, we systematically analyze the robustness of SSMs under noisy conditions, identifying that the final block and output projection layers are more susceptible to perturbations compared to other components. Building on these insights, we propose HPD, a Hybrid Projection Decomposition strategy for the last output projection layer. We replace the original weight matrix with the multiplication of U and {\Sigma} in its SVD to ensure compatibility with existing hardware architectures, while offloading V> to digital hardware for precise and robust correction. Comprehensive tests on Mamba models show that our method reduces perplexity by up to 99.57% under various noise conditions compared to baseline models, with accuracy gains of up to 96.67% on the PIQA benchmark for commonsense reasoning.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents have rapidly evolved from specialized, rule-based programs to versatile, learning-driven autonomous systems capable of perception, reasoning, and action in complex environments. The explosion of data, advances in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and multi-agent coordination have accelerated this transformation. Yet, designing and deploying unified AI agents that seamlessly integrate cognition, planning, and interaction remains a grand challenge. In this review, we systematically examine the architectural principles, foundational components, and emergent paradigms that define the landscape of contemporary AI agents. We synthesize insights from cognitive science-inspired models, hierarchical reinforcement learning frameworks, and large language model-based reasoning. Moreover, we discuss the pressing ethical, safety, and interpretability concerns associated with deploying these agents in real-world scenarios. By highlighting major breakthroughs, persistent challenges, and promising research directions, this review aims to guide the next generation of AI agent systems toward more robust, adaptable, and trustworthy autonomous intelligence.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of hyperbolic geometry for capturing complex patterns from interaction data in recommender systems. In this work, we introduce a novel hyperbolic recommendation model that uses geometrical insights to improve representation learning and increase computational stability at the same time. We reformulate the notion of hyperbolic distances to unlock additional representation capacity over conventional Euclidean space and learn more expressive user and item representations. To better capture user-items interactions, we construct a triplet loss that models ternary relations between users and their corresponding preferred and nonpreferred choices through a mix of pairwise interaction terms driven by the geometry of data. Our hyperbolic approach not only outperforms existing Euclidean and hyperbolic models but also reduces popularity bias, leading to more diverse and personalized recommendations.

Abstract: Future prediction is a complex task for LLM agents, requiring a high level of analytical thinking, information gathering, contextual understanding, and decision-making under uncertainty. Agents must not only gather and interpret vast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources, weigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as human experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its importance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future prediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and retrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically designed for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting real-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated pipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent models, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of external tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source Deep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive reasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide in-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in future-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the temporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free evaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of performing at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and predictive thinking.

<title>MOON: Generative MLLM-based Multimodal Representation Learning for E-commerce Product Understanding</title>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of e-commerce, exploring general representations rather than task-specific ones has attracted increasing research attention. For product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless, achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges: the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2) effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark MBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model demonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the public dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute prediction. Furthermore, the case study and visualization illustrate the effectiveness of MOON for product understanding.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of Hindi speech separation and enhancement using advanced neural network architectures, with a focus on edge devices. We propose a refined approach leveraging the DEMUCS model to overcome limitations of traditional methods, achieving substantial improvements in speech clarity and intelligibility. The model is fine-tuned with U-Net and LSTM layers, trained on a dataset of 400,000 Hindi speech clips augmented with ESC-50 and MS-SNSD for diverse acoustic environments. Evaluation using PESQ and STOI metrics shows superior performance, particularly under extreme noise conditions. To ensure deployment on resource-constrained devices like TWS earbuds, we explore quantization techniques to reduce computational requirements. This research highlights the effectiveness of customized AI algorithms for speech processing in Indian contexts and suggests future directions for optimizing edge-based architectures.

Abstract: Bongard Problems (BPs) provide a challenging testbed for abstract visual reasoning (AVR), requiring models to identify visual concepts fromjust a few examples and describe them in natural language. Early BP benchmarks featured synthetic black-and-white drawings, which might not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. Subsequent BP datasets employed real-world images, albeit the represented concepts are identifiable from high-level image features, reducing the task complexity. Differently, the recently released Bongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the original BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction, however, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining evaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset composed of $5\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts using real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM) pipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually curated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying concepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and manually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended concepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations, including binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer generation. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained visual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained concepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Active inference is a formal approach to study cognition based on the notion that adaptive agents can be seen as engaging in a process of approximate Bayesian inference, via the minimisation of variational and expected free energies. Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and learning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how agents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to maximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative model of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have been proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they all share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an appropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their desirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past motor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents are assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan for the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and must infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for the future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two leading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an efference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions. In this work we compare the performances of action-aware and action-unaware agents in two navigations tasks, showing how action-unaware agents can achieve performances comparable to action-aware ones while at a severe disadvantage.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-binding sites (epitopes) on antigens is crucial for vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, therapeutic antibody development, antibody engineering, research into autoimmune and allergic diseases, and for advancing our understanding of immune responses. Despite in silico methods that have been proposed to predict both linear (continuous) and conformational (discontinuous) epitopes, they consistently underperform in predicting conformational epitopes. In this work, we propose a conformer-based model trained on antigen sequences derived from 1,080 antigen-antibody complexes, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract local features and Transformers to capture long-range dependencies within antigen sequences. Ablation studies demonstrate that CNN enhances the prediction of linear epitopes, and the Transformer module improves the prediction of conformational epitopes. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing baselines in terms of PCC, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and F1 scores on conformational epitopes.

Abstract: Data fusion and transfer learning are rapidly growing fields that enhance model performance for a target population by leveraging other related data sources or tasks. The challenges lie in the various potential heterogeneities between the target and external data, as well as various practical concerns that prevent a na\"ive data integration. We consider a realistic scenario where the target data is limited in size while the external data is large but contaminated with outliers; such data contamination, along with other computational and operational constraints, necessitates proper selection or subsampling of the external data for transfer learning. To our knowledge,transfer learning and subsampling under data contamination have not been thoroughly investigated. We address this gap by studying various transfer learning methods with subsamples of the external data, accounting for outliers deviating from the underlying true model due to arbitrary mean shifts. Two subsampling strategies are investigated: one aimed at reducing biases and the other at minimizing variances. Approaches to combine these strategies are also introduced to enhance the performance of the estimators. We provide non-asymptotic error bounds for the transfer learning estimators, clarifying the roles of sample sizes, signal strength, sampling rates, magnitude of outliers, and tail behaviors of model error distributions, among other factors. Extensive simulations show the superior performance of the proposed methods. Additionally, we apply our methods to analyze the risk of hard landings in A380 airplanes by utilizing data from other airplane types,demonstrating that robust transfer learning can improve estimation efficiency for relatively rare airplane types with the help of data from other types of airplanes.

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have made training object detectors more efficient and effective; however, assessing their performance in real-world applications still relies on costly manual annotation. To address this limitation, we develop an automated model evaluation (AutoEval) framework for object detection. We propose Prediction Consistency and Reliability (PCR), which leverages the multiple candidate bounding boxes that conventional detectors generate before non-maximum suppression (NMS). PCR estimates detection performance without ground-truth labels by jointly measuring 1) the spatial consistency between boxes before and after NMS, and 2) the reliability of the retained boxes via the confidence scores of overlapping boxes. For a more realistic and scalable evaluation, we construct a meta-dataset by applying image corruptions of varying severity. Experimental results demonstrate that PCR yields more accurate performance estimates than existing AutoEval methods, and the proposed meta-dataset covers a wider range of detection performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/autoeval-det.

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) adaptation, balancing multiple optimization objectives such as improving factuality (heat) and increasing confidence (via low entropy) poses a fundamental challenge, especially when prompt parameters (e.g., hidden-layer insertions h and embedding modifications w) interact in non-trivial ways. Existing multi-objective optimization strategies often rely on scalar gradient aggregation, ignoring the deeper geometric structure between objectives and parameters. We propose J6, a structured Jacobian-based method that decomposes the gradient interaction matrix into six interpretable components. This decomposition enables both hard decision-making (e.g., choosing the dominant update direction via argmax) and soft strategies (e.g., attention-style weighting via softmax over J6), forming a dynamic update framework that adapts to local conflict and synergy. Moreover, the interpretable structure of J6 provides insight into parameter attribution, task interference, and geometry-aligned adaptation. Our work introduces a principled and extensible mechanism for conflict-aware prompt optimization, and opens a new avenue for incorporating structured Jacobian reasoning into multi-objective neural tuning.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly challenging as model capabilities advance rapidly. While recent models often achieve higher scores on standard benchmarks, these improvements do not consistently reflect enhanced real-world reasoning capabilities. Moreover, widespread overfitting to public benchmarks and the high computational cost of full evaluations have made it both expensive and less effective to distinguish meaningful differences between models. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{T}ransition \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{M}ethod (STEM), a lightweight and interpretable evaluation framework for efficiently estimating the relative capabilities of LLMs. STEM identifies \textit{significant transition samples} (STS) by analyzing consistent performance transitions among LLMs of the same architecture but varying parameter scales. These samples enable STEM to effectively estimate the capability position of an unknown model. Qwen3 model family is applied to construct the STS pool on six diverse and representative benchmarks. To assess generalizability. Experimental results indicate that STEM reliably captures performance trends, aligns with ground-truth rankings of model capability. These findings highlight STEM as a practical and scalable method for fine-grained, architecture-agnostic evaluation of LLMs.

Abstract: Emotion is a critical component of artificial social intelligence. However, while current methods excel in lip synchronization and image quality, they often fail to generate accurate and controllable emotional expressions while preserving the subject's identity. To address this challenge, we introduce RealTalk, a novel framework for synthesizing emotional talking heads with high emotion accuracy, enhanced emotion controllability, and robust identity preservation. RealTalk employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate 3D facial landmarks from driving audio, which are concatenated with emotion-label embeddings using a ResNet-based landmark deformation model (LDM) to produce emotional landmarks. These landmarks and facial blendshape coefficients jointly condition a novel tri-plane attention Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to synthesize highly realistic emotional talking heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealTalk outperforms existing methods in emotion accuracy, controllability, and identity preservation, advancing the development of socially intelligent AI systems.

Abstract: Robots equipped with rich sensor suites can localize reliably in partially-observable environments, but powering every sensor continuously is wasteful and often infeasible. Belief-space planners address this by propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment, which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an always-on baseline.

Abstract: Forecasting from atmospheric soundings is a fundamental task in operational meteorology, often requiring structured visual reasoning over Skew-T log-P diagrams by human forecasters. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in other scientific domains, their application to meteorological diagram interpretation remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a lightweight AI assistant that interprets Skew-T diagrams using a small language model (LM) and a small VLM fine-tuned to emulate human forecasters. Using a curriculum learning framework, we first train the models to identify key atmospheric features from diagrams through visual question answering, followed by chain-of-thought reasoning tasks that estimate precipitation probability based on the derived visual groundings. Model inputs include either textual summaries or generated Skew-T diagrams derived from operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecasts, paired with three-hour precipitation observations from South Korea's Auto Weather Stations network. Evaluation results demonstrate that the fine-tuned VLM achieves skill comparable to an operational NWP model, despite relying solely on static atmospheric profiles. Ablation studies reveal that visual grounding and reasoning supervision are critical for performance, while attention map analysis confirms that the model learns to focus on relevant meteorological features. These findings highlight the potential of compact, interpretable multimodal models to support weather forecasting tasks. The approach offers a computationally efficient alternative to large-scale systems, and future work could extend it to more complex applications.

Abstract: Industry adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native wireless receivers, or even modular, Machine Learning (ML)-aided wireless signal processing blocks, has been slow. The main concern is the lack of explainability of these trained ML models and the significant risks posed to network functionalities in case of failures, especially since (i) testing on every exhaustive case is infeasible and (ii) the data used for model training may not be available. This paper proposes ATLAS, an AI-guided approach that generates a battery of tests for pre-trained AI-native receiver models and benchmarks the performance against a classical receiver architecture. Using gradient-based optimization, it avoids spanning the exhaustive set of all environment and channel conditions; instead, it generates the next test in an online manner to further probe specific configurations that offer the highest risk of failure. We implement and validate our approach by adopting the well-known DeepRx AI-native receiver model as well as a classical receiver using differentiable tensors in NVIDIA's Sionna environment. ATLAS uncovers specific combinations of mobility, channel delay spread, and noise, where fully and partially trained variants of AI-native DeepRx perform suboptimally compared to the classical receivers. Our proposed method reduces the number of tests required per failure found by 19% compared to grid search for a 3-parameters input optimization problem, demonstrating greater efficiency. In contrast, the computational cost of the grid-based approach scales exponentially with the number of variables, making it increasingly impractical for high-dimensional problems.

Abstract: As a critical component of Wearable AI, IMU-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry in recent years. Although HAR performance has improved considerably in specific scenarios, its generalization capability remains a key barrier to widespread real-world adoption. For example, domain shifts caused by variations in users, sensor positions, or environments can significantly decrease the performance in practice. As a result, in this survey, we explore the rapidly evolving field of IMU-based generalizable HAR, reviewing 229 research papers alongside 25 publicly available datasets to provide a broad and insightful overview. We first present the background and overall framework of IMU-based HAR tasks, as well as the generalization-oriented training settings. Then, we categorize representative methodologies from two perspectives: (i) model-centric approaches, including pre-training method, end-to-end method, and large language model (LLM)-based learning method; and (ii) data-centric approaches, including multi-modal learning and data augmentation techniques. In addition, we summarize widely used datasets in this field, as well as relevant tools and benchmarks. Building on these methodological advances, the broad applicability of IMU-based HAR is also reviewed and discussed. Finally, we discuss persistent challenges (e.g., data scarcity, efficient training, and reliable evaluation) and also outline future directions for HAR, including the adoption of foundation and large language models, physics-informed and context-aware reasoning, generative modeling, and resource-efficient training and inference. The complete list of this survey is available at https://github.com/rh20624/Awesome-IMU-Sensing, which will be updated continuously.

Abstract: Autonomous driving platforms encounter diverse driving scenarios, each with varying hardware resources and precision requirements. Given the computational limitations of embedded devices, it is crucial to consider computing costs when deploying on target platforms like the NVIDIA\textsuperscript{\textregistered} DRIVE PX 2. Our objective is to customize the semantic segmentation network according to the computing power and specific scenarios of autonomous driving hardware. We implement dynamic adaptability through a three-tier control mechanism -- width multiplier, classifier depth, and classifier kernel -- allowing fine-grained control over model components based on hardware constraints and task requirements. This adaptability facilitates broad model scaling, targeted refinement of the final layers, and scenario-specific optimization of kernel sizes, leading to improved resource allocation and performance.
  Additionally, we leverage Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to efficiently explore hyperparameter spaces under tight computational budgets. Our approach addresses scenario-specific and task-specific requirements through automatic parameter search, accommodating the unique computational complexity and accuracy needs of autonomous driving. It scales its Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) for Task-Specific Learning Adaptation (TSLA), resulting in alternative configurations tailored to diverse self-driving tasks. These TSLA customizations maximize computational capacity and model accuracy, optimizing hardware utilization.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has seen remarkable progress, with models like OpenAI Whisper and NVIDIA Canary achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in offline transcription. However, these models are not designed for streaming (online or real-time) transcription, due to limitations in their architecture and training methodology. We propose a method to turn the transformer encoder-decoder model into a low-latency streaming model that is careless about future context. We present an analysis explaining why it is not straightforward to convert an encoder-decoder transformer to a low-latency streaming model. Our proposed method modifies the existing (non-causal) encoder to a causal encoder by fine-tuning both the encoder and decoder using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a weakly aligned dataset. We then propose an updated inference mechanism that utilizes the fine-tune causal encoder and decoder to yield greedy and beam-search decoding, and is shown to be locally optimal. Experiments on low-latency chunk sizes (less than 300 msec) show that our fine-tuned model outperforms existing non-fine-tuned streaming approaches in most cases, while using a lower complexity. Additionally, we observe that our training process yields better alignment, enabling a simple method for extracting word-level timestamps. We release our training and inference code, along with the fine-tuned models, to support further research and development in streaming ASR.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising framework for training agents using pre-collected datasets without the need for further environment interaction. However, policies trained on offline data often struggle to generalise due to limited exposure to diverse states. The complexity of visual data introduces additional challenges such as noise, distractions, and spurious correlations, which can misguide the policy and increase the risk of overfitting if the training data is not sufficiently diverse. Indeed, this makes it challenging to leverage vision-based offline data in training robust agents that can generalize to unseen environments. To solve this problem, we propose a simple approach generating additional synthetic training data. We propose a two-step process, first augmenting the originally collected offline data to improve zero-shot generalization by introducing diversity, then using a diffusion model to generate additional data in latent space. We test our method across both continuous action spaces (Visual D4RL) and discrete action spaces (Procgen), demonstrating that it significantly improves generalization without requiring any algorithmic changes to existing model-free offline RL methods. We show that our method not only increases the diversity of the training data but also significantly reduces the generalization gap at test time while maintaining computational efficiency. We believe this approach could fuel additional progress in generating synthetic data to train more general agents in the future.

Abstract: Flow matching has rapidly become a dominant paradigm in classical generative modeling, offering an efficient way to interpolate between two complex distributions. We extend this idea to the quantum realm and introduce Quantum Flow Matching (QFM)-a fully quantum-circuit realization that offers efficient interpolation between two density matrices. QFM offers systematic preparation of density matrices and generation of samples for accurately estimating observables, and can be realized on a quantum computer without the need for costly circuit redesigns. We validate its versatility on a set of applications: (i) generating target states with prescribed magnetization and entanglement entropy, (ii) estimating nonequilibrium free-energy differences to test the quantum Jarzynski equality, and (iii) expediting the study on superdiffusion breakdown. These results position QFM as a unifying and promising framework for generative modeling across quantum systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL) abilities, enabling them to solve wide range of tasks via textual prompts alone. As these capabilities advance, the range of applicable domains continues to expand significantly. However, identifying the precise mechanisms or internal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse, distinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a promising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such as basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide experimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics grounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for studying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable setting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs, especially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics forecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can learn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics forecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such capability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Our experiments reveal that the features captured by SAEs correlate with key physical variables, such as energy. These findings demonstrate that meaningful physical concepts are encoded within LLMs during in-context learning. In sum, our work provides a novel case study that broadens our understanding of how LLMs learn in context.

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learning approaches require expensive alignment pre-training to bridge vision and language modalities, typically projecting visual features into discrete text token spaces. We challenge both fundamental assumptions underlying this paradigm by proposing Inverse-LLaVA, a novel approach that eliminates alignment pre-training entirely while inverting the conventional mapping direction. Rather than projecting visual features to text space, our method maps text embeddings into continuous visual representation space and performs fusion within transformer intermediate layers. Through selective additive components in attention mechanisms, we enable dynamic integration of visual and textual representations without requiring massive image-text alignment datasets. Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal benchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves notable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%, VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing expected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text associations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%). These results provide the first empirical evidence that alignment pre-training is not necessary for effective multimodal learning, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. Our work establishes the feasibility of a new paradigm that reduces computational requirements by 45%, challenges conventional wisdom about modality fusion, and opens new research directions for efficient multimodal architectures that preserve modality-specific characteristics.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) is an emerging field that has the potential to revolutionize computation by taking advantage of quantum physics concepts in a distributed machine learning (ML) environment. However, the majority of available quantum simulators are primarily built for general quantum circuit simulation and do not include integrated support for machine learning tasks such as training, evaluation, and iterative optimization. Furthermore, designing and assessing quantum learning algorithms is still a difficult and resource-intensive task. Real-time updates are essential for observing model convergence, debugging quantum circuits, and making conscious choices during training with the use of limited resources. Furthermore, most current simulators fail to support the integration of user-specific data for training purposes, undermining the main purpose of using a simulator. In this study, we introduce SimQFL, a customized simulator that simplifies and accelerates QFL experiments in quantum network applications. SimQFL supports real-time, epoch-wise output development and visualization, allowing researchers to monitor the process of learning across each training round. Furthermore, SimQFL offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface that facilitates ease of use and seamless execution. Users can customize key variables such as the number of epochs, learning rates, number of clients, and quantum hyperparameters such as qubits and quantum layers, making the simulator suitable for various QFL applications. The system gives immediate feedback following each epoch by showing intermediate outcomes and dynamically illustrating learning curves. SimQFL is a practical and interactive platform enabling academics and developers to prototype, analyze, and tune quantum neural networks with greater transparency and control in distributed quantum networks.

Abstract: Developing collaborative AI hinges on Theory of Mind (ToM) - the ability to reason about the beliefs of others to build and maintain common ground. Existing ToM benchmarks, however, are restricted to passive observer settings or lack an assessment of how agents establish and maintain common ground over time. To address these gaps, we introduce the Yokai Learning Environment (YLE) - a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) environment based on the cooperative card game Yokai. In the YLE, agents take turns peeking at hidden cards and moving them to form clusters based on colour. Success requires tracking evolving beliefs, remembering past observations, using hints as grounded communication, and maintaining common ground with teammates. Our evaluation yields two key findings: First, current RL agents struggle to solve the YLE, even when given access to perfect memory. Second, while belief modelling improves performance, agents are still unable to effectively generalise to unseen partners or form accurate beliefs over longer games, exposing a reliance on brittle conventions rather than robust belief tracking. We use the YLE to investigate research questions in belief modelling, memory, partner generalisation, and scaling to higher-order ToM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit logically inconsistent hallucinations that appear coherent yet violate reasoning principles, with recent research suggesting an inverse relationship between causal reasoning capabilities and such hallucinations. However, existing reasoning approaches in LLMs, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its graph-based variants, operate at the linguistic token level rather than modeling the underlying causal relationships between variables, lacking the ability to represent conditional independencies or satisfy causal identification assumptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce causal-DAG construction and reasoning (CDCR-SFT), a supervised fine-tuning framework that trains LLMs to explicitly construct variable-level directed acyclic graph (DAG) and then perform reasoning over it. Moreover, we present a dataset comprising 25,368 samples (CausalDR), where each sample includes an input question, explicit causal DAG, graph-based reasoning trace, and validated answer. Experiments on four LLMs across eight tasks show that CDCR-SFT improves the causal reasoning capability with the state-of-the-art 95.33% accuracy on CLADDER (surpassing human performance of 94.8% for the first time) and reduces the hallucination on HaluEval with 10% improvements. It demonstrates that explicit causal structure modeling in LLMs can effectively mitigate logical inconsistencies in LLM outputs. Code is available at https://github.com/MrLYG/CDCR-SFT.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) face challenges, including resource-heavy computations and the need to manually scan outputs to detect "interesting events," such as the formation and persistence of hydrogen bonds between atoms of different molecules. A critical research gap lies in identifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation -understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence over time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal data analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these phenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims to identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation events. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an "intervention" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and separation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models are built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us to infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal graphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step to infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal models. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional distributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation, this framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular dynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the atomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we can predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the observed changes in the system.

Abstract: Sliced Optimal Transport (SOT) is a rapidly developing branch of optimal transport (OT) that exploits the tractability of one-dimensional OT problems. By combining tools from OT, integral geometry, and computational statistics, SOT enables fast and scalable computation of distances, barycenters, and kernels for probability measures, while retaining rich geometric structure. This paper provides a comprehensive review of SOT, covering its mathematical foundations, methodological advances, computational methods, and applications. We discuss key concepts of OT and one-dimensional OT, the role of tools from integral geometry such as Radon transform in projecting measures, and statistical techniques for estimating sliced distances. The paper further explores recent methodological advances, including non-linear projections, improved Monte Carlo approximations, statistical estimation techniques for one-dimensional optimal transport, weighted slicing techniques, and transportation plan estimation methods. Variational problems, such as minimum sliced Wasserstein estimation, barycenters, gradient flows, kernel constructions, and embeddings are examined alongside extensions to unbalanced, partial, multi-marginal, and Gromov-Wasserstein settings. Applications span machine learning, statistics, computer graphics and computer visions, highlighting SOT's versatility as a practical computational tool. This work will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in machine learning, data sciences, and computational disciplines seeking efficient alternatives to classical OT.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can extract interpretable features from large language models (LLMs) without supervision. However, their effectiveness in downstream steering tasks is limited by the requirement for contrastive datasets or large activation storage. To address these limitations, we propose CorrSteer, which selects features by correlating sample correctness with SAE activations from generated tokens at inference time. This approach uses only inference-time activations to extract more relevant features, thereby avoiding spurious correlations. It also obtains steering coefficients from average activations, automating the entire pipeline. Our method shows improved task performance on QA, bias mitigation, jailbreaking prevention, and reasoning benchmarks on Gemma 2 2B and LLaMA 3.1 8B, notably achieving a +4.1% improvement in MMLU performance and a +22.9% improvement in HarmBench with only 4000 samples. Selected features demonstrate semantically meaningful patterns aligned with each task's requirements, revealing the underlying capabilities that drive performance. Our work establishes correlationbased selection as an effective and scalable approach for automated SAE steering across language model applications.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven and context-aware approach to bootstrap trustworthiness of homogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) services in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) based industrial IoT (IIoT) systems. The proposed approach addresses key limitations in adapting existing trust bootstrapping approaches into MEC-based IIoT systems. These key limitations include, the lack of opportunity for a service consumer to interact with a lesser-known service over a prolonged period of time to get a robust measure of its trustworthiness, inability of service consumers to consistently interact with their peers to receive reliable recommendations of the trustworthiness of a lesser-known service as well as the impact of uneven context parameters in different MEC environments causing uneven trust environments for trust evaluation. In addition, the proposed approach also tackles the problem of data sparsity via enabling knowledge sharing among different MEC environments within a given MEC topology. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we carried out a comprehensive evaluation on two real-world datasets suitably adjusted to exhibit the context-dependent trust information accumulated in MEC environments within a given MEC topology. The experimental results affirmed the effectiveness of our approach and its suitability to bootstrap trustworthiness of services in MEC-based IIoT systems.

<title>A Self-Ensemble Inspired Approach for Effective Training of Binary-Weight Spiking Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising approach to low-power applications on neuromorphic hardware due to their energy efficiency. However, training SNNs is challenging because of the non-differentiable spike generation function. To address this issue, the commonly used approach is to adopt the backpropagation through time framework, while assigning the gradient of the non-differentiable function with some surrogates. Similarly, Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) also face the non-differentiability problem and rely on approximating gradients. However, the deep relationship between these two fields and how their training techniques can benefit each other has not been systematically researched. Furthermore, training binary-weight SNNs is even more difficult. In this work, we present a novel perspective on the dynamics of SNNs and their close connection to BNNs through an analysis of the backpropagation process. We demonstrate that training a feedforward SNN can be viewed as training a self-ensemble of a binary-activation neural network with noise injection. Drawing from this new understanding of SNN dynamics, we introduce the Self-Ensemble Inspired training method for (Binary-Weight) SNNs (SEI-BWSNN), which achieves high-performance results with low latency even for the case of the 1-bit weights. Specifically, we leverage a structure of multiple shortcuts and a knowledge distillation-based training technique to improve the training of (binary-weight) SNNs. Notably, by binarizing FFN layers in a Transformer architecture, our approach achieves 82.52% accuracy on ImageNet with only 2 time steps, indicating the effectiveness of our methodology and the potential of binary-weight SNNs.

<title>Towards SISO Bistatic Sensing for ISAC</title>

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems. However, real-world deployment is often limited to low-cost, single-antenna transceivers. In such bistatic Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) setup, clock asynchrony introduces random phase offsets in Channel State Information (CSI), which cannot be mitigated using conventional multi-antenna methods. This work proposes WiDFS 3.0, a lightweight bistatic SISO sensing framework that enables accurate delay and Doppler estimation from distorted CSI by effectively suppressing Doppler mirroring ambiguity. It operates with only a single antenna at both the transmitter and receiver, making it suitable for low-complexity deployments. We propose a self-referencing cross-correlation (SRCC) method for SISO random phase removal and employ delay-domain beamforming to resolve Doppler ambiguity. The resulting unambiguous delay-Doppler-time features enable robust sensing with compact neural networks. Extensive experiments show that WiDFS 3.0 achieves accurate parameter estimation, with performance comparable to or even surpassing that of prior multi-antenna methods, especially in delay estimation. Validated under single- and multi-target scenarios, the extracted ambiguity-resolved features show strong sensing accuracy and generalization. For example, when deployed on the embedded-friendly MobileViT-XXS with only 1.3M parameters, WiDFS 3.0 consistently outperforms conventional features such as CSI amplitude, mirrored Doppler, and multi-receiver aggregated Doppler.

Abstract: With the advance of high-throughput sequencing technologies, it has become feasible to investigate the influence of the entire spectrum of sequencing variations on complex human diseases. Although association studies utilizing the new sequencing technologies hold great promise to unravel novel genetic variants, especially rare genetic variants that contribute to human diseases, the statistical analysis of high-dimensional sequencing data remains a challenge. Advanced analytical methods are in great need to facilitate high-dimensional sequencing data analyses. In this article, we propose a generalized genetic random field (GGRF) method for association analyses of sequencing data. Like other similarity-based methods (e.g., SIMreg and SKAT), the new method has the advantages of avoiding the need to specify thresholds for rare variants and allowing for testing multiple variants acting in different directions and magnitude of effects. The method is built on the generalized estimating equation framework and thus accommodates a variety of disease phenotypes (e.g., quantitative and binary phenotypes). Moreover, it has a nice asymptotic property, and can be applied to small-scale sequencing data without need for small-sample adjustment. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed GGRF attains an improved or comparable power over a commonly used method, SKAT, under various disease scenarios, especially when rare variants play a significant role in disease etiology. We further illustrate GGRF with an application to a real dataset from the Dallas Heart Study. By using GGRF, we were able to detect the association of two candidate genes, ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4, with serum triglyceride.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced (CE) T1-weighted MRI is central to neuro-oncologic diagnosis but requires gadolinium-based agents, which add cost and scan time, raise environmental concerns, and may pose risks to patients. In this work, we propose a two-stage Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF) pipeline for synthesizing volumetric CE brain MRI from non-contrast inputs. First, a patch-based 3D U-Net predicts the voxel-wise posterior mean (minimizing MSE). Then, this initial estimate is refined by a time-conditioned 3D rectified flow to incorporate realistic textures without compromising structural fidelity. We train this model on a multi-institutional collection of paired pre- and post-contrast T1w volumes (BraTS 2023-2025). On a held-out test set of 360 diverse volumes, our best refined outputs achieve an axial FID of $12.46$ and KID of $0.007$ ($\sim 68.7\%$ lower FID than the posterior mean) while maintaining low volumetric MSE of $0.057$ ($\sim 27\%$ higher than the posterior mean). Qualitative comparisons confirm that our method restores lesion margins and vascular details realistically, effectively navigating the perception-distortion trade-off for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Cognitive structure is a student's subjective organization of an objective knowledge system, reflected in the psychological construction of concepts and their relations. However, cognitive structure assessment remains a long-standing challenge in student modeling and psychometrics, persisting as a foundational yet largely unassessable concept in educational practice. This paper introduces a novel framework, Cognitive Structure Generation (CSG), in which we first pretrain a Cognitive Structure Diffusion Probabilistic Model (CSDPM) to generate students' cognitive structures from educational priors, and then further optimize its generative process as a policy with hierarchical reward signals via reinforcement learning to align with genuine cognitive development levels during students' learning processes. Experimental results on four popular real-world education datasets show that cognitive structures generated by CSG offer more comprehensive and effective representations for student modeling, substantially improving performance on KT and CD tasks while enhancing interpretability.

<title>DIT: Dimension Reduction View on Optimal NFT Rarity Meters</title>

Abstract: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become a significant digital asset class, each uniquely representing virtual entities such as artworks. These tokens are stored in collections within smart contracts and are actively traded across platforms on Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana blockchains. The value of NFTs is closely tied to their distinctive characteristics that define rarity, leading to a growing interest in quantifying rarity within both industry and academia. While there are existing rarity meters for assessing NFT rarity, comparing them can be challenging without direct access to the underlying collection data. The Rating over all Rarities (ROAR) benchmark addresses this challenge by providing a standardized framework for evaluating NFT rarity. This paper explores a dimension reduction approach to rarity design, introducing new performance measures and meters, and evaluates them using the ROAR benchmark. Our contributions to the rarity meter design issue include developing an optimal rarity meter design using non-metric weighted multidimensional scaling, introducing Dissimilarity in Trades (DIT) as a performance measure inspired by dimension reduction techniques, and unveiling the non-interpretable rarity meter DIT, which demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Dynamic relational structures play a central role in many AI tasks, but their evolving nature presents challenges for consistent and interpretable representation. A common approach is to learn time-varying node embeddings, whose effectiveness depends on satisfying key stability properties. In this paper, we propose Unfolded Laplacian Spectral Embedding, a new method that extends the Unfolded Adjacency Spectral Embedding framework to normalized Laplacians while preserving both cross-sectional and longitudinal stability. We provide formal proof that our method satisfies these stability conditions. In addition, as a bonus of using the Laplacian matrix, we establish a new Cheeger-style inequality that connects the embeddings to the conductance of the underlying dynamic graphs. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the strong performance of our method. These results establish a principled and stable framework for dynamic network representation grounded in spectral graph theory.

Abstract: Dynamic control of soft continuum robots (SCRs) holds great potential for expanding their applications, but remains a challenging problem due to the high computational demands of accurate dynamic models. While data-driven approaches like Koopman-operator-based methods have been proposed, they typically lack adaptability and cannot capture the full robot shape, limiting their applicability. This work introduces a real-time-capable nonlinear model-predictive control (MPC) framework for SCRs based on a domain-decoupled physics-informed neural network (DD-PINN) with adaptable bending stiffness. The DD-PINN serves as a surrogate for the dynamic Cosserat rod model with a speed-up factor of 44000. It is also used within an unscented Kalman filter for estimating the model states and bending compliance from end-effector position measurements. We implement a nonlinear evolutionary MPC running at 70 Hz on the GPU. In simulation, it demonstrates accurate tracking of dynamic trajectories and setpoint control with end-effector position errors below 3 mm (2.3% of the actuator's length). In real-world experiments, the controller achieves similar accuracy and accelerations up to 3.55 m/s2.

Abstract: Agentic task-solving with Large Language Models (LLMs) requires multi-turn, multi-step interactions, often involving complex function calls and dynamic user-agent exchanges. Existing simulation-based data generation methods for such scenarios rely heavily on costly autoregressive interactions between multiple LLM agents, thereby limiting real-world performance of agentic tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Non-Autoregressive Iterative Generation framework, called ToolACE-MT, for constructing high-quality multi-turn agentic dialogues. ToolACE-MT generates full conversational trajectories through three stages: coarse-grained initialization, iterative refinement, and offline verification. The initialization phase builds a structurally complete yet semantically coarse dialogue skeleton; the iterative refinement phase introduces realistic complexities and continued refinement via mask-and-fill operations; and the offline verification phase ensures correctness and coherence via rule- and model-based checks. Experiments demonstrate that ToolACE-MT enables efficient, effective and generalizable agentic data generation, offering a new paradigm for high-quality data construction in tool-augmented LLM scenarios.

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) poses a challenge, requiring models to dynamically adapt and perform optimally on shifting target domains. This task is particularly emphasized in real-world driving scenes, where weather domain shifts occur frequently. To address such dynamic changes, our proposed method, TTA-DAME, leverages source domain data augmentation into target domains. Additionally, we introduce a domain discriminator and a specialized domain detector to mitigate drastic domain shifts, especially from daytime to nighttime conditions. To further improve adaptability, we train multiple detectors and consolidate their predictions through Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Our empirical validation demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, showing significant performance enhancements on the SHIFT Benchmark.

Abstract: Leveraging the Transformer architecture and the diffusion process, video DiT models have emerged as a dominant approach for high-quality video generation. However, their multi-step iterative denoising process incurs high computational cost and inference latency. Caching, a widely adopted optimization method in DiT models, leverages the redundancy in the diffusion process to skip computations in different granularities (e.g., step, cfg, block). Nevertheless, existing caching methods are limited to single-granularity strategies, struggling to balance generation quality and inference speed in a flexible manner. In this work, we propose MixCache, a training-free caching-based framework for efficient video DiT inference. It first distinguishes the interference and boundary between different caching strategies, and then introduces a context-aware cache triggering strategy to determine when caching should be enabled, along with an adaptive hybrid cache decision strategy for dynamically selecting the optimal caching granularity. Extensive experiments on diverse models demonstrate that, MixCache can significantly accelerate video generation (e.g., 1.94$\times$ speedup on Wan 14B, 1.97$\times$ speedup on HunyuanVideo) while delivering both superior generation quality and inference efficiency compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Class-incremental with repetition (CIR), where previously trained classes repeatedly introduced in future tasks, is a more realistic scenario than the traditional class incremental setup, which assumes that each task contains unseen classes. CIR assumes that we can easily access abundant unlabeled data from external sources, such as the Internet. Therefore, we propose two components that efficiently use the unlabeled data to ensure the high stability and the plasticity of models trained in CIR setup. First, we introduce multi-level knowledge distillation (MLKD) that distills knowledge from multiple previous models across multiple perspectives, including features and logits, so the model can maintain much various previous knowledge. Moreover, we implement dynamic self-supervised loss (SSL) to utilize the unlabeled data that accelerates the learning of new classes, while dynamic weighting of SSL keeps the focus of training to the primary task. Both of our proposed components significantly improve the performance in CIR setup, achieving 2nd place in the CVPR 5th CLVISION Challenge.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove target training data from a trained model so that the removed data no longer influences the model's behavior, fulfilling "right to be forgotten" obligations under data privacy laws. Yet, we observe that researchers in this rapidly emerging field face challenges in analyzing and understanding the behavior of different MU methods, especially in terms of three fundamental principles in MU: accuracy, efficiency, and privacy. Consequently, they often rely on aggregate metrics and ad-hoc evaluations, making it difficult to accurately assess the trade-offs between methods. To fill this gap, we introduce a visual analytics system, Unlearning Comparator, designed to facilitate the systematic evaluation of MU methods. Our system supports two important tasks in the evaluation process: model comparison and attack simulation. First, it allows the user to compare the behaviors of two models, such as a model generated by a certain method and a retrained baseline, at class-, instance-, and layer-levels to better understand the changes made after unlearning. Second, our system simulates membership inference attacks (MIAs) to evaluate the privacy of a method, where an attacker attempts to determine whether specific data samples were part of the original training set. We evaluate our system through a case study visually analyzing prominent MU methods and demonstrate that it helps the user not only understand model behaviors but also gain insights that can inform the improvement of MU methods.

Abstract: Many control problems require repeated tuning and adaptation of controllers across distinct closed-loop tasks, where data efficiency and adaptability are critical. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian optimization (BO) framework that is tailored to efficient controller parameter learning in sequential decision-making and control scenarios for distinct tasks. Instead of treating the closed-loop cost as a black-box, our method exploits structural knowledge of the underlying problem, consisting of a dynamical system, a control law, and an associated closed-loop cost function. We construct a hierarchical surrogate model using Gaussian processes that capture the closed-loop state evolution under different parameterizations, while the task-specific weighting and accumulation into the closed-loop cost are computed exactly via known closed-form expressions. This allows knowledge transfer and enhanced data efficiency between different closed-loop tasks. The proposed framework retains sublinear regret guarantees on par with standard black-box BO, while enabling multi-task or transfer learning. Simulation experiments with model predictive control demonstrate substantial benefits in both sample efficiency and adaptability when compared to purely black-box BO approaches.

Abstract: There is a tradeoff between attaining statistical power with large, difficult to gather data sets, and producing highly scalable assays that register brief data samples. Often, as grand-averaging techniques a priori assume normally-distributed parameters and linear, stationary processes in biorhythmic, time series data, important information is lost, averaged out as gross data. We developed an affective computing platform that enables taking brief data samples while maintaining personalized statistical power. This is achieved by combining a new data type derived from the micropeaks present in time series data registered from brief (5-second-long) face videos with recent advances in AI-driven face-grid estimation methods. By adopting geometric and nonlinear dynamical systems approaches to analyze the kinematics, especially the speed data, the new methods capture all facial micropeaks. These include as well the nuances of different affective micro expressions. We offer new ways to differentiate dynamical and geometric patterns present in autistic individuals from those found more commonly in neurotypical development.

Abstract: Empowered by deep learning, semantic communication marks a paradigm shift from transmitting raw data to conveying task-relevant meaning, enabling more efficient and intelligent wireless systems. In this study, we explore a deep learning-based task-oriented communication framework that jointly considers classification performance, computational latency, and communication cost. We adopt ResNets-based models and evaluate them on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets to simulate real-world classification tasks in wireless environments. We partition the model at various points to simulate split inference across a wireless channel. By varying the split location and the size of the transmitted semantic feature vector, we systematically analyze the trade-offs between task accuracy and resource efficiency. Experimental results show that, with appropriate model partitioning and semantic feature compression, the system can retain over 85\% of baseline accuracy while significantly reducing both computational load and communication overhead.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by the success of OpenAI's o-series. In RLVR, rewards are derived from verifiable signals-such as passing unit tests in code generation or matching correct answers in mathematical reasoning. While effective, this requirement largely confines RLVR to domains with automatically checkable outcomes. To overcome this, we extend the RLVR paradigm to open-ended tasks by integrating rubric-based rewards, where carefully designed rubrics serve as structured, model-interpretable criteria for automatic scoring of subjective outputs. We construct, to our knowledge, the largest rubric reward system to date, with over 10,000 rubrics from humans, LLMs, or a hybrid human-LLM collaboration. Implementing rubric-based RL is challenging; we tackle these issues with a clear framework and present an open-sourced Qwen-30B-A3B model with notable gains: 1) With only 5K+ samples, our system improves by +5.2% on open-ended benchmarks (especially humanities), outperforming a 671B DeepSeek-V3 model by +2.4%, while preserving general and reasoning abilities. 2) Our method provides fine-grained stylistic control, using rubrics as anchors to mitigate the "AI-like" tone and produce more human-like, expressive responses. We share key lessons in rubric construction, data selection, and training, and discuss limitations and future releases.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to image generation by decomposing an image into a structured sequence, where each element in the sequence shares the same spatial resolution but differs in the number of unique tokens used, capturing different level of visual granularity. Image generation is carried out through our newly introduced Next Visual Granularity (NVG) generation framework, which generates a visual granularity sequence beginning from an empty image and progressively refines it, from global layout to fine details, in a structured manner. This iterative process encodes a hierarchical, layered representation that offers fine-grained control over the generation process across multiple granularity levels. We train a series of NVG models for class-conditional image generation on the ImageNet dataset and observe clear scaling behavior. Compared to the VAR series, NVG consistently outperforms it in terms of FID scores (3.30 -> 3.03, 2.57 ->2.44, 2.09 -> 2.06). We also conduct extensive analysis to showcase the capability and potential of the NVG framework. Our code and models will be released.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained scenarios has driven the development of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) system. However, this approach is susceptible to privacy leakage, as the data sent from the client to the untrusted cloud server often contains sensitive information. Existing CNN privacy-preserving schemes, while effective in ensuring data confidentiality through homomorphic encryption and secret sharing, face efficiency bottlenecks, particularly in convolution operations. In this paper, we propose a novel verifiable privacy-preserving scheme tailored for CNN convolutional layers. Our scheme enables efficient encryption and decryption, allowing resource-constrained clients to securely offload computations to the untrusted cloud server. Additionally, we present a verification mechanism capable of detecting the correctness of the results with a success probability of at least $1-\frac{1}{\left|Z\right|}$. Extensive experiments conducted on 10 datasets and various CNN models demonstrate that our scheme achieves speedups ranging $26 \times$ ~ $\ 87\times$ compared to the original plaintext model while maintaining accuracy.

<title>Optimal Condition for Initialization Variance in Deep Neural Networks: An SGD Dynamics Perspective</title>

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), one of the most fundamental optimization algorithms in machine learning (ML), can be recast through a continuous-time approximation as a Fokker-Planck equation for Langevin dynamics, a viewpoint that has motivated many theoretical studies. Within this framework, we study the relationship between the quasi-stationary distribution derived from this equation and the initial distribution through the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. As the quasi-steady-state distribution depends on the expected cost function, the KL divergence eventually reveals the connection between the expected cost function and the initialization distribution. By applying this to deep neural network models (DNNs), we can express the bounds of the expected loss function explicitly in terms of the initialization parameters. Then, by minimizing this bound, we obtain an optimal condition of the initialization variance in the Gaussian case. This result provides a concrete mathematical criterion, rather than a heuristic approach, to select the scale of weight initialization in DNNs. In addition, we experimentally confirm our theoretical results by using the classical SGD to train fully connected neural networks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. The result shows that if the variance of the initialization distribution satisfies our theoretical optimal condition, then the corresponding DNN model always achieves lower final training loss and higher test accuracy than the conventional He-normal initialization. Our work thus supplies a mathematically grounded indicator that guides the choice of initialization variance and clarifies its physical meaning of the dynamics of parameters in DNNs.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a powerful paradigm for solving cooperative and competitive decision-making problems. While many MARL benchmarks have been proposed, few combine continuous state and action spaces with challenging coordination and planning tasks. We introduce CAMAR, a new MARL benchmark designed explicitly for multi-agent pathfinding in environments with continuous actions. CAMAR supports cooperative and competitive interactions between agents and runs efficiently at up to 100,000 environment steps per second. We also propose a three-tier evaluation protocol to better track algorithmic progress and enable deeper analysis of performance. In addition, CAMAR allows the integration of classical planning methods such as RRT and RRT* into MARL pipelines. We use them as standalone baselines and combine RRT* with popular MARL algorithms to create hybrid approaches. We provide a suite of test scenarios and benchmarking tools to ensure reproducibility and fair comparison. Experiments show that CAMAR presents a challenging and realistic testbed for the MARL community.

<title>The path to a goal: Understanding soccer possessions via path signatures</title>

Abstract: We present a novel framework for predicting next actions in soccer possessions by leveraging path signatures to encode their complex spatio-temporal structure. Unlike existing approaches, we do not rely on fixed historical windows and handcrafted features, but rather encode the entire recent possession, thereby avoiding the inclusion of potentially irrelevant or misleading historical information. Path signatures naturally capture the order and interaction of events, providing a mathematically grounded feature encoding for variable-length time series of irregular sampling frequencies without the necessity for manual feature engineering. Our proposed approach outperforms a transformer-based benchmark across various loss metrics and considerably reduces computational cost. Building on these results, we introduce a new possession evaluation metric based on well-established frameworks in soccer analytics, incorporating both predicted action type probabilities and action location. Our metric shows greater reliability than existing metrics in domain-specific comparisons. Finally, we validate our approach through a detailed analysis of the 2017/18 Premier League season and discuss further applications and future extensions.

Abstract: A central challenge in many areas of science and engineering is to identify model parameters that are consistent with prior knowledge and empirical data. Bayesian inference offers a principled framework for this task, but can be computationally prohibitive when models are defined by stochastic simulators. Simulation-based Inference (SBI) is a suite of methods developed to overcome this limitation, which has enabled scientific discoveries in fields such as particle physics, astrophysics, and neuroscience. The core idea of SBI is to train neural networks on data generated by a simulator, without requiring access to likelihood evaluations. Once trained, inference is amortized: The neural network can rapidly perform Bayesian inference on empirical observations without requiring additional training or simulations. In this tutorial, we provide a practical guide for practitioners aiming to apply SBI methods. We outline a structured SBI workflow and offer practical guidelines and diagnostic tools for every stage of the process -- from setting up the simulator and prior, choosing and training inference networks, to performing inference and validating the results. We illustrate these steps through examples from astrophysics, psychophysics, and neuroscience. This tutorial empowers researchers to apply state-of-the-art SBI methods, facilitating efficient parameter inference for scientific discovery.

Abstract: Anatomic tracer studies are critical for validating and improving diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography. However, large-scale analysis of data from such studies is hampered by the labor-intensive process of annotating fiber bundles manually on histological slides. Existing automated methods often miss sparse bundles or require complex post-processing across consecutive sections, limiting their flexibility and generalizability. We present a streamlined, fully automated framework for fiber bundle segmentation in macaque tracer data, based on a U-Net architecture with large patch sizes, foreground aware sampling, and semisupervised pre-training. Our approach eliminates common errors such as mislabeling terminals as bundles, improves detection of sparse bundles by over 20% and reduces the False Discovery Rate (FDR) by 40% compared to the state-of-the-art, all while enabling analysis of standalone slices. This new framework will facilitate the automated analysis of anatomic tracing data at a large scale, generating more ground-truth data that can be used to validate and optimize dMRI tractography methods.

Abstract: Public service systems in many African regions suffer from delayed emergency response and spatial inequity, causing avoidable suffering. This paper introduces OPTIC-ER, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for real-time, adaptive, and equitable emergency response. OPTIC-ER uses an attention-guided actor-critic architecture to manage the complexity of dispatch environments. Its key innovations are a Context-Rich State Vector, encoding action sub-optimality, and a Precision Reward Function, which penalizes inefficiency. Training occurs in a high-fidelity simulation using real data from Rivers State, Nigeria, accelerated by a precomputed Travel Time Atlas. The system is built on the TALS framework (Thin computing, Adaptability, Low-cost, Scalability) for deployment in low-resource settings. In evaluations on 500 unseen incidents, OPTIC-ER achieved a 100.00% optimality rate with negligible inefficiency, confirming its robustness and generalization. Beyond dispatch, the system generates Infrastructure Deficiency Maps and Equity Monitoring Dashboards to guide proactive governance and data-informed development. This work presents a validated blueprint for AI-augmented public services, showing how context-aware RL can bridge the gap between algorithmic decision-making and measurable human impact.

Abstract: Originally introduced in cooperative game theory, Shapley values have become a very popular tool to explain machine learning predictions. Based on Shapley's fairness axioms, every input (feature component) gets a credit how it contributes to an output (prediction). These credits are then used to explain the prediction. The only limitation in computing the Shapley values (credits) for many different predictions is of computational nature. There are two popular sampling approximations, sampling KernelSHAP and sampling PermutationSHAP. Our first novel contributions are asymptotic normality results for these sampling approximations. Next, we show that the paired-sampling approaches provide exact results in case of interactions being of maximal order two. Furthermore, the paired-sampling PermutationSHAP possesses the additive recovery property, whereas its kernel counterpart does not.

Abstract: We explore the performance of several state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) models on a large-scale Arabic speech dataset, the SADA (Saudi Audio Dataset for Arabic), which contains 668 hours of high-quality audio from Saudi television shows. The dataset includes multiple dialects and environments, specifically a noisy subset that makes it particularly challenging for ASR. We evaluate the performance of the models on the SADA test set, and we explore the impact of fine-tuning, language models, as well as noise and denoising on their performance. We find that the best performing model is the MMS 1B model finetuned on SADA with a 4-gram language model that achieves a WER of 40.9\% and a CER of 17.6\% on the SADA test clean set.

Abstract: We utilize transfer learning to extrapolate the physics knowledge encoded in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model trained on synthetic charged-current (CC) neutrino-carbon inclusive scattering data. This base model is adapted to generate CC inclusive scattering events (lepton kinematics only) for neutrino-argon and antineutrino-carbon interactions. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of transfer learning in re-optimizing a custom model when new data comes from a different neutrino-nucleus interaction model. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly outperforms training generative models from scratch. To study this, we consider two training data sets: one with 10,000 and another with 100,000 events. The models obtained via transfer learning perform well even with smaller training data. The proposed method provides a promising approach for constructing neutrino scattering event generators in scenarios where experimental data is sparse.

Abstract: Open set recognition (OSR) and continual learning are two critical challenges in machine learning, focusing respectively on detecting novel classes at inference time and updating models to incorporate the new classes. While many recent approaches have addressed these problems, particularly OSR, by heuristically promoting feature diversity, few studies have directly examined the role that feature diversity plays in tackling them. In this work, we provide empirical evidence that enhancing feature diversity improves the recognition of open set samples. Moreover, increased feature diversity also facilitates both the retention of previously learned data and the integration of new data in continual learning. We hope our findings can inspire further research into both practical methods and theoretical understanding in these domains.

Abstract: Personalized news recommendation aims to deliver news articles aligned with users' interests, serving as a key solution to alleviate the problem of information overload on online news platforms. While prior work has improved interest matching through refined representations of news and users, the following time-related challenges remain underexplored: (C1) leveraging the age of clicked news to infer users' interest persistence, and (C2) modeling the varying lifetime of news across topics and users. To jointly address these challenges, we propose a novel Lifetime-aware Interest Matching framework for nEws recommendation, named LIME, which incorporates three key strategies: (1) User-Topic lifetime-aware age representation to capture the relative age of news with respect to a user-topic pair, (2) Candidate-aware lifetime attention for generating temporally aligned user representation, and (3) Freshness-guided interest refinement for prioritizing valid candidate news at prediction time. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that LIME consistently outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art news recommendation methods, and its model agnostic strategies significantly improve recommendation accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a two-stage multimodal framework that enhances disease classification and region-aware radiology report generation from chest X-rays, leveraging the MIMIC-Eye dataset. In the first stage, we introduce a gaze-guided contrastive learning architecture for disease classification. It integrates visual features, clinical labels, bounding boxes, and radiologist eye-tracking signals and is equipped with a novel multi-term gaze-attention loss combining MSE, KL divergence, correlation, and center-of-mass alignment. Incorporating fixations improves F1 score from 0.597 to 0.631 (+5.70%) and AUC from 0.821 to 0.849 (+3.41%), while also improving precision and recall, highlighting the effectiveness of gaze-informed attention supervision. In the second stage, we present a modular report generation pipeline that extracts confidence-weighted diagnostic keywords, maps them to anatomical regions using a curated dictionary constructed from domain-specific priors, and generates region-aligned sentences via structured prompts. This pipeline improves report quality as measured by clinical keyword recall and ROUGE overlap. Our results demonstrate that integrating gaze data improves both classification performance and the interpretability of generated medical reports.

Abstract: Programmable structures are systems whose undeformed geometries and material property distributions are deliberately designed to achieve prescribed deformed configurations under specific loading conditions. Inflatable structures are a prominent example, using internal pressurization to realize large, nonlinear deformations in applications ranging from soft robotics and deployable aerospace systems to biomedical devices and adaptive architecture. We present a generative design framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for the inverse design of elastic structures undergoing large, nonlinear deformations under pressure-driven actuation. The method formulates the inverse design as a conditional generation task, using geometric descriptors of target deformed states as inputs and outputting image-based representations of the undeformed configuration. Representing these configurations as simple images is achieved by establishing a pre- and postprocessing pipeline that involves a fixed image processing, simulation setup, and descriptor extraction methods. Numerical experiments with scalar and higher-dimensional descriptors show that the framework can quickly produce diverse undeformed configurations that achieve the desired deformations when inflated, enabling parallel exploration of viable design candidates while accommodating complex constraints.

Abstract: Watermarking has recently emerged as an effective strategy for detecting the generations of large language models (LLMs). The strength of a watermark typically depends strongly on the entropy afforded by the language model and the set of input prompts. However, entropy can be quite limited in practice, especially for models that are post-trained, for example via instruction tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which makes detection based on watermarking alone challenging. In this work, we investigate whether detection can be improved by combining watermark detectors with non-watermark ones. We explore a number of hybrid schemes that combine the two, observing performance gains over either class of detector under a wide range of experimental conditions.

Abstract: Thinking LLMs solve complex tasks at the expense of increased compute and overthinking on simpler problems, while non-thinking LLMs are faster and cheaper but underthink on harder reasoning problems. This has led to the development of separate thinking and non-thinking LLM variants, leaving the onus of selecting the optimal model for each query on the end user. In this work, we introduce OptimalThinkingBench, a unified benchmark that jointly evaluates overthinking and underthinking in LLMs and also encourages the development of optimally-thinking models that balance performance and efficiency. Our benchmark comprises two sub-benchmarks: OverthinkingBench, featuring simple queries in 72 domains, and UnderthinkingBench, containing 11 challenging reasoning tasks. Using novel thinking-adjusted accuracy metrics, we perform extensive evaluation of 33 different thinking and non-thinking models and show that no model is able to optimally think on our benchmark. Thinking models often overthink for hundreds of tokens on the simplest user queries without improving performance. In contrast, large non-thinking models underthink, often falling short of much smaller thinking models. We further explore several methods to encourage optimal thinking, but find that these approaches often improve on one sub-benchmark at the expense of the other, highlighting the need for better unified and optimal models in the future.

Abstract: Multi-modal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, which are fundamental capabilities to achieving artificial general intelligence. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. First, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and discuss the challenges in ensuring fair evaluation. We then evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models on eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding one billion total tokens. Our empirical study reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence, yet (2) still falls short of human performance across a broad spectrum of tasks. Moreover, we (3) identify the more challenging spatial intelligence problems for multi-modal models, and (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult problems. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans yet fail even the most advanced multi-modal models.

Abstract: Developing large language models is expensive and involves making decisions with small experiments, typically by evaluating on large, multi-task evaluation suites. In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark more reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality evaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in current benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models from worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability between training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better signal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale, and those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These results suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful benchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect signal or noise. For example, we propose that switching to a metric that has better signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better reliability and improved scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy subtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable multi-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's intermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements. We conclude by recommending that those creating new benchmarks, or selecting which existing benchmarks to use, aim for high signal and low noise. We use 30 benchmarks for these experiments, and 375 open-weight language models from 60M to 32B parameters, resulting in a new, publicly available dataset of 900K evaluation benchmark results, totaling 200M instances.

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in visual data, including images and videos, are crucial in machine learning and real-world applications. Despite rapid advancements in visual anomaly detection (VAD), interpreting these often black-box models and explaining why specific instances are flagged as anomalous remains challenging. This paper provides the first comprehensive survey focused specifically on explainable 2D visual anomaly detection (X-VAD), covering methods for both images (IAD) and videos (VAD). We first introduce the background of IAD and VAD. Then, as the core contribution, we present a thorough literature review of explainable methods, categorized by their underlying techniques (e.g., attention-based, generative model-based, reasoning-based, foundation model-based). We analyze the commonalities and differences in applying these methods across image and video modalities, highlighting modality-specific challenges and opportunities for explainability. Additionally, we summarize relevant datasets and evaluation metrics, discussing both standard performance metrics and emerging approaches for assessing explanation quality (e.g., faithfulness, stability). Finally, we discuss promising future directions and open problems, including quantifying explanation quality, explaining diverse AD paradigms (SSL, zero-shot), enhancing context-awareness, leveraging foundation models responsibly, and addressing real-world constraints like efficiency and robustness.

<title>On Delta-Homology Analogy: Memory as Structured Trajectories</title>

Abstract: We introduce the \emph{delta-homology analogy}, which formalizes memory as a set of sparse, topologically irreducible attractors. A \emph{Dirac delta-like memory trace} \( \delta_\gamma \) is identified with a nontrivial homology generator \( [\gamma] \in H_1(\mathcal{Z}) \) on a latent manifold of cognitive states. Such traces are sharply localized along reproducible topological cycles and are only activated when inference trajectories complete a full cycle. They encode minimal, path-dependent memory units that cannot be synthesized from local features alone. Based on the analogy, we propose a topological framework for memory and inference grounded in the structure of spike-timing dynamics and persistent homology. Starting from the observation that polychronous neural groups (PNGs) encode reproducible, time-locked spike sequences shaped by axonal delays and synaptic plasticity, we construct \emph{spatiotemporal complexes} whose temporally consistent transitions define chain complexes over which robust activation cycles emerge. These activation loops are abstracted into \emph{cell posets}, enabling a compact and causally ordered representation of neural activity with overlapping and compositional memory traces.

Abstract: Compute-in-memory accelerators built upon non-volatile memory devices excel in energy efficiency and latency when performing deep neural network (DNN) inference, thanks to their in-situ data processing capability. However, the stochastic nature and intrinsic variations of non-volatile memory devices often result in performance degradation during DNN inference. Introducing these non-ideal device behaviors in DNN training enhances robustness, but drawbacks include limited accuracy improvement, reduced prediction confidence, and convergence issues. This arises from a mismatch between the deterministic training and non-deterministic device variations, as such training, though considering variations, relies solely on the model's final output. In this work, inspired by control theory, we propose Negative Feedback Training (NeFT), a novel concept supported by theoretical analysis, to more effectively capture the multi-scale noisy information throughout the network. We instantiate this concept with two specific instances, oriented variational forward (OVF) and intermediate representation snapshot (IRS). Based on device variation models extracted from measured data, extensive experiments show that our NeFT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods with up to a 45.08% improvement in inference accuracy while reducing epistemic uncertainty, boosting output confidence, and improving convergence probability. These results underline the generality and practicality of our NeFT framework for increasing the robustness of DNNs against device variations. The source code for these two instances is available at https://github.com/YifanQin-ND/NeFT_CIM

Abstract: Recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have led to increased model sizes to enhance their capacity and accuracy. Such large models incur high memory usage, latency, and computational costs, thereby restricting their inference deployment. GNN compression techniques compress large GNNs into smaller ones with negligible accuracy loss. One of the most promising compression techniques is knowledge distillation (KD). However, most KD approaches for GNNs only consider the outputs of the last layers and do not consider the outputs of the intermediate layers of the GNNs. The intermediate layers may contain important inductive biases indicated by the graph structure and embeddings. Ignoring these layers may lead to a high accuracy drop, especially when the compression ratio is high. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel KD approach for GNN compression that we call Structure and Embedding Distillation with Attention (STRIDE). STRIDE utilizes attention to identify important intermediate teacher-student layer pairs and focuses on using those pairs to align graph structure and node embeddings. We evaluate STRIDE on several datasets, such as OGBN-Mag and OGBN-Arxiv, using different model architectures, including GCNIIs, RGCNs, and GraphSAGE. On average, STRIDE achieves a 2.13% increase in accuracy with a 32.3X compression ratio on OGBN-Mag, a large graph dataset, compared to state-of-the-art approaches. On smaller datasets (e.g., Pubmed), STRIDE achieves up to a 141X compression ratio with the same accuracy as state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of focusing on intermediate-layer knowledge to obtain compact, accurate, and practical GNN models.

<title>TRIALSCOPE: A Unifying Causal Framework for Scaling Real-World Evidence Generation with Biomedical Language Models</title>

Abstract: The rapid digitization of real-world data presents an unprecedented opportunity to optimize healthcare delivery and accelerate biomedical discovery. However, these data are often found in unstructured forms such as clinical notes in electronic medical records (EMRs), and is typically plagued by confounders, making it challenging to generate robust real-world evidence (RWE). Therefore, we present TRIALSCOPE, a framework designed to distil RWE from population level observational data at scale. TRIALSCOPE leverages biomedical language models to structure clinical text at scale, employs advanced probabilistic modeling for denoising and imputation, and incorporates state-of-the-art causal inference techniques to address common confounders in treatment effect estimation. Extensive experiments were conducted on a large-scale dataset of over one million cancer patients from a single large healthcare network in the United States. TRIALSCOPE was shown to automatically curate high-quality structured patient data, expanding the dataset and incorporating key patient attributes only available in unstructured form. The framework reduces confounding in treatment effect estimation, generating comparable results to randomized controlled lung cancer trials. Additionally, we demonstrate simulations of unconducted clinical trials - including a pancreatic cancer trial with varying eligibility criteria - using a suite of validation tests to ensure robustness. Thorough ablation studies were conducted to better understand key components of TRIALSCOPE and establish best practices for RWE generation from EMRs. TRIALSCOPE was able to extract data cancer treatment data from EMRs, overcoming limitations of manual curation. We were also able to show that TRIALSCOPE could reproduce results of lung and pancreatic cancer clinical trials from the extracted real world data.

Abstract: In tasks aiming for long-term returns, planning becomes essential. We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer-based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstraction despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub-optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting.

Abstract: Time series are generated in diverse domains such as economic, traffic, health, and energy, where forecasting of future values has numerous important applications. Not surprisingly, many forecasting methods are being proposed. To ensure progress, it is essential to be able to study and compare such methods empirically in a comprehensive and reliable manner. To achieve this, we propose TFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. TFB advances the state-of-the-art by addressing shortcomings related to datasets, comparison methods, and evaluation pipelines: 1) insufficient coverage of data domains, 2) stereotype bias against traditional methods, and 3) inconsistent and inflexible pipelines. To achieve better domain coverage, we include datasets from 10 different domains: traffic, electricity, energy, the environment, nature, economic, stock markets, banking, health, and the web. We also provide a time series characterization to ensure that the selected datasets are comprehensive. To remove biases against some methods, we include a diverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies and metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To support the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair comparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates biases. Next, we employ TFB to perform a thorough evaluation of 21 Univariate Time Series Forecasting (UTSF) methods on 8,068 univariate time series and 14 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) methods on 25 datasets. The benchmark code and data are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TFB. We have also launched an online time series leaderboard: https://decisionintelligence.github.io/OpenTS/OpenTS-Bench/.

Abstract: In traditional statistical learning, data points are usually assumed to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) following an unknown probability distribution. This paper presents a contrasting viewpoint, perceiving data points as interconnected and employing a Markov reward process (MRP) for data modeling. We reformulate the typical supervised learning as an on-policy policy evaluation problem within reinforcement learning (RL), introducing a generalized temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm as a resolution. Theoretically, our analysis establishes connections between the solutions of linear TD learning and ordinary least squares (OLS). Under specific conditions -- particularly when the noise is correlated -- the TD solution serves as a more effective estimator than OLS. Furthermore, we show that when our algorithm is applied with many commonly used loss functions -- such as those found in generalized linear models -- it corresponds to the application of a novel and generalized Bellman operator. We prove that this operator admits a unique fixed point, and based on this, we establish convergence guarantees for our generalized TD algorithm under linear function approximation. Empirical studies verify our theoretical results, examine the vital design of our TD algorithm and show practical utility across various datasets, encompassing tasks such as regression and image classification with deep learning.

Abstract: Setting up and controlling optical systems is often a challenging and tedious task. The high number of degrees of freedom to control mirrors, lenses, or phases of light makes automatic control challenging, especially when the complexity of the system cannot be adequately modeled due to noise or non-linearities. Here, we show that reinforcement learning (RL) can overcome these challenges when coupling laser light into an optical fiber, using a model-free RL approach that trains directly on the experiment without pre-training on simulations. By utilizing the sample-efficient algorithms Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), or CrossQ, our agents learn to couple with 90% efficiency. A human expert reaches this efficiency, but the RL agents are quicker. In particular, the CrossQ agent outperforms the other agents in coupling speed while requiring only half the training time. We demonstrate that direct training on an experiment can replace extensive system modeling. Our result exemplifies RL's potential to tackle problems in optics, paving the way for more complex applications where full noise modeling is not feasible.

<title>Clustering-Based Validation Splits for Model Selection under Domain Shift</title>

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of model selection under domain shift. Motivated by principles from distributionally robust optimisation and domain adaptation theory, it is proposed that the training-validation split should maximise the distribution mismatch between the two sets. By adopting the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as the measure of mismatch, it is shown that the partitioning problem reduces to kernel k-means clustering. A constrained clustering algorithm, which leverages linear programming to control the size, label, and (optionally) group distributions of the splits, is presented. The algorithm does not require additional metadata, and comes with convergence guarantees. In experiments, the technique consistently outperforms alternative splitting strategies across a range of datasets and training algorithms, for both domain generalisation and unsupervised domain adaptation tasks. Analysis also shows the MMD between the training and validation sets to be well-correlated with test domain accuracy, further substantiating the validity of this approach.

Abstract: Machine unlearning offers effective solutions for revoking the influence of specific training data on pre-trained model parameters. While existing approaches address unlearning for classification and generative models, they overlook an important category of machine learning models: contrastive learning (CL) methods. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the Machine Unlearning for Contrastive Learning (MUC) framework and adapting existing methods. We identify limitations in current approaches, noting that several methods perform inadequately as unlearners and that existing evaluation tools insufficiently validate unlearning effects in contrastive learning. To address these issues, we propose Alignment Calibration (AC), a novel method that explicitly considers contrastive learning properties and optimizes towards new auditing metrics for easy verification of unlearning. Through empirical comparisons with baseline methods on SimCLR, MoCo, and CLIP, we demonstrate that AC: (1) achieves state-of-the-art performance, approximating exact unlearning (retraining); (2) enables data owners to clearly visualize unlearning effects through black-box evaluation. The code is available at https://github.com/EhanW/Alignment-Calibration.

Abstract: We present a formulation of flow matching as variational inference, which we refer to as variational flow matching (VFM). Based on this formulation we develop CatFlow, a flow matching method for categorical data. CatFlow is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and achieves strong results on graph generation tasks. In VFM, the objective is to approximate the posterior probability path, which is a distribution over possible end points of a trajectory. We show that VFM admits both the CatFlow objective and the original flow matching objective as special cases. We also relate VFM to score-based models, in which the dynamics are stochastic rather than deterministic, and derive a bound on the model likelihood based on a reweighted VFM objective. We evaluate CatFlow on one abstract graph generation task and two molecular generation tasks. In all cases, CatFlow exceeds or matches performance of the current state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in logical reasoning, in-context learning, and code generation. However, translating natural language instructions into effective robotic control policies remains a significant challenge, especially for tasks requiring long-horizon planning and operating under sparse reward conditions. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) provides a natural framework to address this challenge in robotics; however, it typically suffers from non-stationarity caused by the changing behavior of the lower-level policy during training, destabilizing higher-level policy learning. We introduce LGR2, a novel HRL framework that leverages LLMs to generate language-guided reward functions for the higher-level policy. By decoupling high-level reward generation from low-level policy changes, LGR2 fundamentally mitigates the non-stationarity problem in off-policy HRL, enabling stable and efficient learning. To further enhance sample efficiency in sparse environments, we integrate goal-conditioned hindsight experience relabeling. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world robotic navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate LGR2 outperforms both hierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines, achieving over 55% success rates on challenging tasks and robust transfer to real robots, without additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: When using large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes applications, we need to know when we can trust their predictions. Some works argue that prompting high-performance LLMs is sufficient to produce calibrated uncertainties, while others introduce sampling methods that can be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we first argue that prompting on its own is insufficient to achieve good calibration and then show that fine-tuning on a small dataset of correct and incorrect answers can create an uncertainty estimate with good generalization and small computational overhead. We show that a thousand graded examples are sufficient to outperform baseline methods and that training through the features of a model is necessary for good performance and tractable for large open-source models when using LoRA. We also investigate the mechanisms that enable reliable LLM uncertainty estimation, finding that many models can be used as general-purpose uncertainty estimators, applicable not just to their own uncertainties but also the uncertainty of other models. Lastly, we show that uncertainty estimates inform human use of LLMs in human-AI collaborative settings through a user study.

Abstract: Effectively learning from sequential data is a longstanding goal of Artificial Intelligence, especially in the case of long sequences. From the dawn of Machine Learning, several researchers have pursued algorithms and architectures capable of processing sequences of patterns, retaining information about past inputs while still leveraging future data, without losing precious long-term dependencies and correlations. While such an ultimate goal is inspired by the human hallmark of continuous real-time processing of sensory information, several solutions have simplified the learning paradigm by artificially limiting the processed context or dealing with sequences of limited length, given in advance. These solutions were further emphasized by the ubiquity of Transformers, which initially overshadowed the role of Recurrent Neural Nets. However, recurrent networks are currently experiencing a strong recent revival due to the growing popularity of (deep) State-Space models and novel instances of large-context Transformers, which are both based on recurrent computations that aim to go beyond several limits of currently ubiquitous technologies. The fast development of Large Language Models has renewed the interest in efficient solutions to process data over time. This survey provides an in-depth summary of the latest approaches that are based on recurrent models for sequential data processing. A complete taxonomy of recent trends in architectural and algorithmic solutions is reported and discussed, guiding researchers in this appealing research field. The emerging picture suggests that there is room for exploring novel routes, constituted by learning algorithms that depart from the standard Backpropagation Through Time, towards a more realistic scenario where patterns are effectively processed online, leveraging local-forward computations, and opening new directions for research on this topic.

Abstract: In continual learning, knowledge must be preserved and re-used between tasks, maintaining good transfer to future tasks and minimizing forgetting of previously learned ones. While several practical algorithms have been devised for this setting, there have been few theoretical works aiming to quantify and bound the degree of Forgetting in general settings. For \emph{exemplar-free} methods, we provide both data-dependent upper bounds that apply \emph{regardless of model and algorithm choice}, and oracle bounds for Gibbs posteriors. We derive an algorithm based on our bounds and demonstrate empirically that our approach yields tight and practical bounds on forgetting for several continual learning problems and algorithms.

Abstract: With recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), spectral GNNs have received increasing popularity by virtue of their ability to retrieve graph signals in the spectral domain. These models feature uniqueness in efficient computation as well as rich expressiveness, which stems from advanced management and profound understanding of graph data. However, few systematic studies have been conducted to assess spectral GNNs, particularly in benchmarking their efficiency, memory consumption, and effectiveness in a unified and fair manner. There is also a pressing need to select spectral models suitable for learning specific graph data and deploying them to massive web-scale graphs, which is currently constrained by the varied model designs and training settings.
  In this work, we extensively benchmark spectral GNNs with a focus on the spectral perspective, demystifying them as spectral graph filters. We analyze and categorize 35 GNNs with 27 corresponding filters, spanning diverse formulations and utilizations of the graph data. Then, we implement the filters within a unified spectral-oriented framework with dedicated graph computations and efficient training schemes. In particular, our implementation enables the deployment of spectral GNNs over million-scale graphs and various tasks with comparable performance and less overhead. Thorough experiments are conducted on the graph filters with comprehensive metrics on effectiveness and efficiency, offering novel observations and practical guidelines that are only available from our evaluations across graph scales. Different from the prevailing belief, our benchmark reveals an intricate landscape regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of spectral graph filters, demonstrating the potential to achieve desirable performance through tailored spectral manipulation of graph data.

This potential is currently hampered by a lack of comprehensible benchmarks for multivariate time series anomaly detection, especially for the challenging case of satellite telemetry. The European Space Agency Benchmark for Anomaly Detection in Satellite Telemetry (ESA-ADB) aims to address this challenge and establish a new standard in the domain. It is a result of close cooperation between spacecraft operations engineers from the European Space Agency (ESA) and machine learning experts. The newly introduced ESA Anomalies Dataset contains annotated real-life telemetry from three different ESA missions, out of which two are included in ESA-ADB. Results of typical anomaly detection algorithms assessed in our novel hierarchical evaluation pipeline show that new approaches are necessary to address operators' needs. All elements of ESA-ADB are publicly available to ensure its full reproducibility.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved success in solving Bayesian inverse problems with learned data priors. Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method to handle the time dimension when Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to solve time-dependent differential equations; our proposal focuses on how time sampling and weighting strategies affect solution quality. While previous methods proposed heuristic time-weighting schemes, our approach is grounded in theoretical insights derived from the Lyapunov exponents, which quantify the sensitivity of solutions to perturbations over time. This principled methodology automatically adjusts weights based on the stability regime of the system -- whether chaotic, periodic, or stable. Numerical experiments on challenging benchmarks, including the chaotic Lorenz system and the Burgers' equation, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Compared to existing techniques, our approach offers improved convergence and accuracy without requiring additional hyperparameter tuning. The findings underline the importance of incorporating causality and dynamical system behavior into PINN training strategies, providing a robust framework for solving time-dependent problems with enhanced reliability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely employed across various application domains, yet their black-box nature poses significant challenges to understanding how these models process input data internally to make predictions. In this paper, we introduce a precise and quantitative law that governs the learning of contextualized token embeddings through intermediate layers in pre-trained LLMs for next-token prediction. Our findings reveal that each layer contributes equally to enhancing prediction accuracy, from the lowest to the highest layer -- a universal phenomenon observed across a diverse array of open-source LLMs, irrespective of their architectures or pre-training data. We demonstrate that this law offers new perspectives and actionable insights to inform and guide practices in LLM development and applications, including model scaling, pre-training tasks, and interpretation.

Abstract: Although data that can be naturally represented as graphs is widespread in real-world applications across diverse industries, popular graph ML benchmarks for node property prediction only cover a surprisingly narrow set of data domains, and graph neural networks (GNNs) are often evaluated on just a few academic citation networks. This issue is particularly pressing in light of the recent growing interest in designing graph foundation models. These models are supposed to be able to transfer to diverse graph datasets from different domains, and yet the proposed graph foundation models are often evaluated on a very limited set of datasets from narrow applications. To alleviate this issue, we introduce GraphLand: a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction from a range of different industrial applications. GraphLand allows evaluating graph ML models on a wide range of graphs with diverse sizes, structural characteristics, and feature sets, all in a unified setting. Further, GraphLand allows investigating such previously underexplored research questions as how realistic temporal distributional shifts under transductive and inductive settings influence graph ML model performance. To mimic realistic industrial settings, we use GraphLand to compare GNNs with gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) models that are popular in industrial applications and show that GBDTs provided with additional graph-based input features can sometimes be very strong baselines. Further, we evaluate currently available general-purpose graph foundation models and find that they fail to produce competitive results on our proposed datasets.

Abstract: Heart failure is a leading cause of global mortality, necessitating improved diagnostic strategies. Classical machine learning models struggle with challenges such as high-dimensional data, class imbalances, poor feature representations, and a lack of interpretability. While quantum machine learning holds promise, current hybrid models have not fully exploited quantum advantages. In this paper, we propose the Kolmogorov-Arnold Classical-Quantum Dual-Channel Neural Network (KACQ-DCNN), a novel hybrid architecture that replaces traditional multilayer perceptrons with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), enabling learnable univariate activation functions. Our KACQ-DCNN 4-qubit, 1-layer model outperforms 37 benchmark models, including 16 classical and 12 quantum neural networks, achieving an accuracy of 92.03%, with macro-average precision, recall, and F1 scores of 92.00%. It also achieved a ROC-AUC of 94.77%, surpassing other models by significant margins, as validated by paired t-tests with a significance threshold of 0.0056 (after Bonferroni correction). Ablation studies highlight the synergistic effect of classical-quantum integration, improving performance by about 2% over MLP variants. Additionally, LIME and SHAP explainability techniques enhance feature interpretability, while conformal prediction provides robust uncertainty quantification. Our results demonstrate that KACQ-DCNN improves cardiovascular diagnostics by combining high accuracy with interpretability and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: The substantial effect of air pollution on cardiovascular disease and mortality burdens is well-established. Emissions-reducing interventions on coal-fired power plants -- a major source of hazardous air pollution -- have proven to be an effective, but costly, strategy for reducing pollution-related health burdens. Targeting the power plants that achieve maximum health benefits while satisfying realistic cost constraints is challenging. The primary difficulty lies in quantifying the health benefits of intervening at particular plants. This is further complicated because interventions are applied on power plants, while health impacts occur in potentially distant communities, a setting known as bipartite network interference (BNI). In this paper, we introduce novel policy learning methods based on Q- and A-Learning to determine the optimal policy under arbitrary BNI. We derive asymptotic properties and demonstrate finite sample efficacy in simulations. We apply our novel methods to a comprehensive dataset of Medicare claims, power plant data, and pollution transport networks. Our goal is to determine the optimal strategy for installing power plant scrubbers to minimize ischemic heart disease (IHD) hospitalizations under various cost constraints. We find that annual IHD hospitalization rates could be reduced in a range from 23.37-55.30 per 10,000 person-years through optimal policies under different cost constraints.

Abstract: Effective visual representation learning is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to extract task-relevant information from raw sensory inputs and generalize across diverse environments. However, existing RL benchmarks lack the ability to systematically evaluate representation learning capabilities in isolation from other learning challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Sliding Puzzles Gym (SPGym), a novel benchmark that transforms the classic 8-tile puzzle into a visual RL task with images drawn from arbitrarily large datasets. SPGym's key innovation lies in its ability to precisely control representation learning complexity through adjustable grid sizes and image pools, while maintaining fixed environment dynamics, observation, and action spaces. This design enables researchers to isolate and scale the visual representation challenge independently of other learning components. Through extensive experiments with model-free and model-based RL algorithms, we uncover fundamental limitations in current methods' ability to handle visual diversity. As we increase the pool of possible images, all algorithms exhibit in- and out-of-distribution performance degradation, with sophisticated representation learning techniques often underperforming simpler approaches like data augmentation. These findings highlight critical gaps in visual representation learning for RL and establish SPGym as a valuable tool for driving progress in robust, generalizable decision-making systems.

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) enables agents to solve complex, long-horizon tasks by decomposing them into manageable sub-tasks. However, HRL methods often suffer from two fundamental challenges: (i) non-stationarity, caused by the changing behavior of the lower-level policy during training, which destabilizes higher-level policy learning, and (ii) the generation of infeasible subgoals that lower-level policies cannot achieve. In this work, we introduce DIPPER, a novel HRL framework that formulates hierarchical policy learning as a bi-level optimization problem and leverages direct preference optimization (DPO) to train the higher-level policy using preference feedback. By optimizing the higher-level policy with DPO, we decouple higher-level learning from the non-stationary lower-level reward signal, thus mitigating non-stationarity. To further address the infeasible subgoal problem, DIPPER incorporates a regularization that tries to ensure the feasibility of subgoal tasks within the capabilities of the lower-level policy. Extensive experiments on challenging robotic navigation and manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that DIPPER achieves up to 40\% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in sparse reward scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding limitations of HRL.

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that the brain uses an attention schema, or a simplified model of attention, to help control what it attends to. One proposed benefit of this model is to allow agents to model the attention states of other agents, and thus predict and interact with other agents. The effects of an attention schema may be examined in artificial agents. Although attention mechanisms in artificial agents are different from in biological brains, there may be some principles in common. In both cases, select features or representations are emphasized for better performance. Here, using neural networks with transformer attention mechanisms, we asked whether the addition of an attention schema affected the ability of agents to make judgements about and cooperate with each other. First, we found that an agent with an attention schema is better at categorizing the attention states of other agents (higher accuracy). Second, an agent with an attention schema develops a pattern of attention that is easier for other agents to categorize. Third, in a joint task where two agents must predict each other to paint a scene together, adding an attention schema improves performance. Finally, the performance improvements are not caused by a general increase in network complexity. Instead, improvement is specific to tasks involving judging, categorizing, or predicting the attention of other agents. These results support the hypothesis that an attention schema has computational properties beneficial to mutual interpretability and interactive behavior. We speculate that the same principles might pertain to biological attention and attention schemas in people.

Abstract: Conveyor belts are crucial in mining operations by enabling the continuous and efficient movement of bulk materials over long distances, which directly impacts productivity. While detecting anomalies in specific conveyor belt components has been widely studied, identifying the root causes of these failures, such as changing production conditions and operator errors, remains critical. Continuous monitoring of mining conveyor belt work cycles is still at an early stage and requires robust solutions. Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models. The explored low-computational models include decision tree, random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. A comprehensive evaluation of the former and proposed approaches is carried out on two datasets. Both proposed methods outperform the former method in anomaly detection, with the best-performing approach being dataset-dependent. The heuristic rule-based approach achieves the highest F1-score in the same dataset used for algorithm training, with 97.3% for normal cycles and 80.2% for abnormal cycles. The ML-based approach performs better on a dataset including the effects of machine aging, with an F1-score scoring 91.3% for normal cycles and 67.9% for abnormal cycles. Implemented on two low-power microcontrollers, the methods demonstrate efficient, real-time operation with energy consumption of 13.3 and 20.6 \textmu J during inference. These results ...

<title>Segmenting Action-Value Functions Over Time-Scales in SARSA via TD($\Delta$)</title>

Abstract: In numerous episodic reinforcement learning (RL) environments, SARSA-based methodologies are employed to enhance policies aimed at maximizing returns over long horizons. Traditional SARSA algorithms face challenges in achieving an optimal balance between bias and variation, primarily due to their dependence on a single, constant discount factor ($\eta$). This investigation enhances the temporal difference decomposition method, TD($\Delta$), by applying it to the SARSA algorithm, now designated as SARSA($\Delta$). SARSA is a widely used on-policy RL method that enhances action-value functions via temporal difference updates. By splitting the action-value function down into components that are linked to specific discount factors, SARSA($\Delta$) makes learning easier across a range of time scales. This analysis makes learning more effective and ensures consistency, particularly in situations where long-horizon improvement is needed. The results of this research show that the suggested strategy works to lower bias in SARSA's updates and speed up convergence in both deterministic and stochastic settings, even in dense reward Atari environments. Experimental results from a variety of benchmark settings show that the proposed SARSA($\Delta$) outperforms existing TD learning techniques in both tabular and deep RL environments.

Abstract: Deploying deep models in real-world scenarios remains challenging due to significant performance drops under distribution shifts between training and deployment environments. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a promising solution, enabling on-the-fly model adaptation without access to source data. However, its effectiveness degrades significantly in the presence of complex, mixed distribution shifts - common in practical settings - where multiple latent domains coexist. Adapting under such intrinsic heterogeneity, especially in unlabeled and online conditions, remains an open and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we study TTA under mixed distribution shifts and move beyond conventional homogeneous adaptation paradigms. By revisiting TTA from a frequency-domain perspective, we observe that distribution heterogeneity often manifests in Fourier space - for instance, high-frequency components tend to carry domain-specific variations. This motivates us to perform domain-aware separation using high-frequency texture cues, making diverse shift patterns more tractable. To this end, we propose FreDA, a novel Frequency-based Decentralized Adaptation framework that decomposes globally heterogeneous data into locally homogeneous components in the frequency domain. It further employs decentralized learning and augmentation strategies to robustly adapt under complex, evolving shifts. Extensive experiments across various environments (corrupted, natural, and medical) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over the state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are effective in learning expressive representations for signed graphs but typically require substantial task-specific labels, limiting their applicability in label-scarce industrial scenarios. In contrast, unsigned graph structures are abundant and can be readily leveraged to pre-train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offering a promising solution to reduce supervision requirements in downstream signed graph tasks. However, transferring knowledge from unsigned to signed graphs is non-trivial due to the fundamental discrepancies in graph types and task objectives between pre-training and downstream phases. To address this challenge, we propose Signed Graph Prompt Tuning (SGPT), a novel graph prompting framework that adapts pre-trained unsigned GNNs to few-shot signed graph tasks. We first design a graph template based on balance theory to disentangle mixed node relationships introduced by negative links, mitigating the structural mismatches between unsigned and signed graphs. We further introduce a task template that reformulates downstream signed tasks into a unified link prediction objective, aligning their optimization goals with the pre-training task. Furthermore, we develop feature prompts that align downstream semantic spaces with the feature spaces learned during pre-training, and semantic prompts to integrate link sign semantics in a task-aware manner. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmark signed graph datasets, demonstrating that SGPT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, establishing a powerful and generalizable solution for few-shot signed graph learning.

Abstract: The ideas of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty are widely used to reason about the probabilistic predictions of machine-learning models. We identify incoherence in existing discussions of these ideas and suggest this stems from the aleatoric-epistemic view being insufficiently expressive to capture all the distinct quantities that researchers are interested in. To address this we present a decision-theoretic perspective that relates rigorous notions of uncertainty, predictive performance and statistical dispersion in data. This serves to support clearer thinking as the field moves forward. Additionally we provide insights into popular information-theoretic quantities, showing they can be poor estimators of what they are often purported to measure, while also explaining how they can still be useful in guiding data acquisition.

Abstract: What types of numeric representations emerge in neural systems, and what would a satisfying answer to this question look like? In this work, we interpret Neural Network (NN) solutions to sequence based number tasks using a variety of methods to understand how well we can interpret them through the lens of interpretable Symbolic Algorithms (SAs) -- precise programs describable by rules and typed, mutable variables. We use autoregressive GRUs, LSTMs, and Transformers trained on tasks where the correct tokens depend on numeric information only latent in the task structure. We show through multiple causal and theoretical methods that we can interpret raw NN activity through the lens of simplified SAs when we frame the activity in terms of neural subspaces rather than individual neurons. Using Distributed Alignment Search (DAS), we find that, depending on network architecture, dimensionality, and task specifications, alignments with SA's can be very high, or they can be only approximate, or fail altogether. We extend our analytic toolkit to address the failure cases by expanding the DAS framework to a broader class of alignment functions that more flexibly capture NN activity in terms of interpretable variables from SAs, and we provide theoretic and empirical explorations of Linear Alignment Functions (LAFs) in contrast to the preexisting Orthogonal Alignment Functions (OAFs). Through analyses of specific cases we confirm the usefulness of causal interventions on neural subspaces for NN interpretability, and we show that recurrent models can develop graded, symbol-like number variables in their neural activity. We further show that shallow Transformers learn very different solutions than recurrent networks, and we prove that such models must use anti-Markovian solutions -- solutions that do not rely on cumulative, Markovian hidden states -- in the absence of sufficient attention layers.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a kind of deep-learning-based numerical solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs). Existing PINNs often suffer from failure modes of being unable to propagate patterns of initial conditions. We discover that these failure modes are caused by the simplicity bias of neural networks and the mismatch between PDE's continuity and PINN's discrete sampling. We reveal that the State Space Model (SSM) can be a continuous-discrete articulation allowing initial condition propagation, and that simplicity bias can be eliminated by aligning a sequence of moderate granularity. Accordingly, we propose PINNMamba, a novel framework that introduces sub-sequence modeling with SSM. Experimental results show that PINNMamba can reduce errors by up to 86.3\% compared with state-of-the-art architecture. Our code is available at https://github.com/miniHuiHui/PINNMamba.

Abstract: Accurate weather forecasts are important for disaster prevention, agricultural planning, etc. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods offer physically interpretable high-accuracy predictions but are computationally expensive and fail to fully leverage rapidly growing historical data. In recent years, deep learning models have made significant progress in weather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event predictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework (OneForecast) based on graph neural networks. By combining a dynamic system perspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure and densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We introduce an adaptive messaging mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply integrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting. For high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method to mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that OneForecast performs excellently across global to regional scales and short-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions.

Abstract: Learning diffusion bridge models is easy; making them fast and practical is an art. Diffusion bridge models (DBMs) are a promising extension of diffusion models for applications in image-to-image translation. However, like many modern diffusion and flow models, DBMs suffer from the problem of slow inference. To address it, we propose a novel distillation technique based on the inverse bridge matching formulation and derive the tractable objective to solve it in practice. Unlike previously developed DBM distillation techniques, the proposed method can distill both conditional and unconditional types of DBMs, distill models in a one-step generator, and use only the corrupted images for training. We evaluate our approach for both conditional and unconditional types of bridge matching on a wide set of setups, including super-resolution, JPEG restoration, sketch-to-image, and other tasks, and show that our distillation technique allows us to accelerate the inference of DBMs from 4x to 100x and even provide better generation quality than used teacher model depending on particular setup.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) is a powerful framework for solving generative modeling tasks such as unpaired domain translation. Most SB-related research focuses on continuous data space $\mathbb{R}^{D}$ and leaves open theoretical and algorithmic questions about applying SB methods to discrete data, e.g, on finite spaces $\mathbb{S}^{D}$. Notable examples of such sets $\mathbb{S}$ are codebooks of vector-quantized (VQ) representations of modern autoencoders, tokens in texts, categories of atoms in molecules, etc. In this paper, we provide a theoretical and algorithmic foundation for solving SB in discrete spaces using the recently introduced Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure. Specifically, we theoretically justify the convergence of discrete-time IMF (D-IMF) to SB in discrete spaces. This enables us to develop a practical computational algorithm for SB, which we call Categorical Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (CSBM). We show the performance of CSBM via a series of experiments with synthetic data and VQ representations of images. The code of CSBM is available at https://github.com/gregkseno/csbm.

Abstract: We study the policy evaluation problem in an online multi-reward multi-policy discounted setting, where multiple reward functions must be evaluated simultaneously for different policies. We adopt an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC perspective to achieve $\epsilon$-accurate estimates with high confidence across finite or convex sets of rewards, a setting that has not been investigated in the literature. Building on prior work on Multi-Reward Best Policy Identification, we adapt the MR-NaS exploration scheme to jointly minimize sample complexity for evaluating different policies across different reward sets. Our approach leverages an instance-specific lower bound revealing how the sample complexity scales with a measure of value deviation, guiding the design of an efficient exploration policy. Although computing this bound entails a hard non-convex optimization, we propose an efficient convex approximation that holds for both finite and convex reward sets. Experiments in tabular domains demonstrate the effectiveness of this adaptive exploration scheme.

Abstract: Learning complex distributions is a fundamental challenge in contemporary applications. Shen and Meinshausen (2024) introduced engression, a generative approach based on scoring rules that maps noise (and covariates, if available) directly to data. While effective, engression can struggle with highly complex distributions, such as those encountered in image data. In this work, we propose reverse Markov learning (RML), a framework that defines a general forward process transitioning from the target distribution to a known distribution (e.g., Gaussian) and then learns a reverse Markov process using multiple engression models. This reverse process reconstructs the target distribution step by step. This framework accommodates general forward processes, allows for dimension reduction, and naturally discretizes the generative process. In the special case of diffusion-based forward processes, RML provides an efficient discretization strategy for both training and inference in diffusion models. We further introduce an alternating sampling scheme to enhance post-training performance. Our statistical analysis establishes error bounds for RML and elucidates its advantages in estimation efficiency and flexibility in forward process design. Empirical results on simulated and climate data corroborate the theoretical findings, demonstrating the effectiveness of RML in capturing complex distributions.

Abstract: Modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have made significant advances in handling continuous action spaces. However, real-world control systems--especially those requiring precise and reliable performance--often demand interpretability in the sense of a-priori assessments of agent behavior to identify safe or failure-prone interactions with environments. To address this limitation, we propose SALSA-RL (Stability Analysis in the Latent Space of Actions), a novel RL framework that models control actions as dynamic, time-dependent variables evolving within a latent space. By employing a pre-trained encoder-decoder and a state-dependent linear system, our approach enables interpretability through local stability analysis, where instantaneous growth in action-norms can be predicted before their execution. We demonstrate that SALSA-RL can be deployed in a non-invasive manner for assessing the local stability of actions from pretrained RL agents without compromising on performance across diverse benchmark environments. By enabling a more interpretable analysis of action generation, SALSA-RL provides a powerful tool for advancing the design, analysis, and theoretical understanding of RL systems.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) has enjoyed great success in machine learning as a principled way to align datasets via a least-cost correspondence, driven in large part by the runtime efficiency of the Sinkhorn algorithm (Cuturi, 2013). However, Sinkhorn has quadratic space and time complexity in the number of points, limiting scalability to larger datasets. Low-rank OT achieves linear complexity, but by definition, cannot compute a one-to-one correspondence between points. When the optimal transport problem is an assignment problem between datasets then an optimal mapping, known as the Monge map, is guaranteed to be a bijection. In this setting, we show that the factors of an optimal low-rank coupling co-cluster each point with its image under the Monge map. We leverage this invariant to derive an algorithm, Hierarchical Refinement (HiRef), that dynamically constructs a multiscale partition of each dataset using low-rank OT subproblems, culminating in the bijective Monge map. Hierarchical Refinement runs in log-linear time and linear space, retaining the advantages of low-rank OT while overcoming its limited resolution. We demonstrate the advantages of Hierarchical Refinement on several datasets, including ones containing over a million points, scaling full-rank OT to problems previously beyond Sinkhorn's reach.

Abstract: We propose a new dimensionality reduction toolkit designed to address some of the challenges faced by traditional methods like UMAP and tSNE such as loss of global structure and computational efficiency. Built on the JAX framework, DiRe leverages modern hardware acceleration to provide an efficient, scalable, and interpretable solution for visualizing complex data structures, and for quantitative analysis of lower-dimensional embeddings. The toolkit shows considerable promise in preserving both local and global structures within the data as compared to state-of-the-art UMAP and tSNE implementations. This makes it suitable for a wide range of applications in machine learning, bio-informatics, and data science.

Abstract: Most offline RL algorithms return optimal policies but do not provide statistical guarantees on desirable behaviors. This could generate reliability issues in safety-critical applications, such as in some multiagent domains where agents, and possibly humans, need to interact to reach their goals without harming each other. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL approach, inspired by Seldonian optimization, which returns policies with good performance and statistically guaranteed properties with respect to predefined desirable behaviors. In particular, our focus is on Ad Hoc Teamwork settings, where agents must collaborate with new teammates without prior coordination. Our method requires only a pre-collected dataset, a set of candidate policies for our agent, and a specification about the possible policies followed by the other players -- it does not require further interactions, training, or assumptions on the type and architecture of the policies. We test our algorithm in Ad Hoc Teamwork problems and show that it consistently finds reliable policies while improving sample efficiency with respect to standard ML baselines.

Abstract: Online Knowledge Distillation (KD) is recently highlighted to train large models in Federated Learning (FL) environments. Many existing studies adopt the logit ensemble method to perform KD on the server side. However, they often assume that unlabeled data collected at the edge is centralized on the server. Moreover, the logit ensemble method personalizes local models, which can degrade the quality of soft targets, especially when data is highly non-IID. To address these critical limitations,we propose a novel on-device KD-based heterogeneous FL method. Our approach leverages a small auxiliary model to learn from labeled local data. Subsequently, a subset of clients with strong system resources transfers knowledge to a large model through on-device KD using their unlabeled data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our on-device KD-based heterogeneous FL method effectively utilizes the system resources of all edge devices as well as the unlabeled data, resulting in higher accuracy compared to SOTA KD-based FL methods.

<title>MedSpaformer: a Transferable Transformer with Multi-granularity Token Sparsification for Medical Time Series Classification</title>

Abstract: Accurate medical time series (MedTS) classification is essential for effective clinical diagnosis, yet remains challenging due to complex multi-channel temporal dependencies, information redundancy, and label scarcity. While transformer-based models have shown promise in time series analysis, most are designed for forecasting tasks and fail to fully exploit the unique characteristics of MedTS. In this paper, we introduce MedSpaformer, a transformer-based framework tailored for MedTS classification. It incorporates a sparse token-based dual-attention mechanism that enables global context modeling and token sparsification, allowing dynamic feature refinement by focusing on informative tokens while reducing redundancy. This mechanism is integrated into a multi-granularity cross-channel encoding scheme to capture intra- and inter-granularity temporal dependencies and inter-channel correlations, enabling progressive refinement of task-relevant patterns in medical signals. The sparsification design allows our model to flexibly accommodate inputs with variable lengths and channel dimensions. We also introduce an adaptive label encoder to extract label semantics and address cross-dataset label space misalignment. Together, these components enhance the model's transferability across heterogeneous medical datasets, which helps alleviate the challenge of label scarcity. Our model outperforms 13 baselines across 7 medical datasets under supervised learning. It also excels in few-shot learning and demonstrates zero-shot capability in both in-domain and cross-domain diagnostics. These results highlight MedSpaformer's robustness and its potential as a unified solution for MedTS classification across diverse settings.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the merits of explicitly optimizing for inference time algorithmic performance during model training. We show how optimizing for inference time performance can improve overall model efficacy. We consider generic inference time objectives with $k$ samples, with a focus on pass@$k$ and majority voting as two main applications. With language model training on reasoning datasets, we showcase the performance trade-off enabled by training with such objectives. When training on code generation tasks, we show that the approach significantly improves pass@$k$ objectives compared to the baseline method.

<title>NoProp: Training Neural Networks without Full Back-propagation or Full Forward-propagation</title>

Abstract: The canonical deep learning approach for learning requires computing a gradient term at each block by back-propagating the error signal from the output towards each learnable parameter. Given the stacked structure of neural networks, where each block builds on the representation of the block below, this approach leads to hierarchical representations. More abstract features live on the top blocks of the model, while features on lower blocks are expected to be less abstract. In contrast to this, we introduce a new learning method named NoProp, which does not rely on either forward or backwards propagation across the entire network. Instead, NoProp takes inspiration from diffusion and flow matching methods, where each block independently learns to denoise a noisy target using only local targets and back-propagation within the block. We believe this work takes a first step towards introducing a new family of learning methods that does not learn hierarchical representations -- at least not in the usual sense. NoProp needs to fix the representation at each block beforehand to a noised version of the target, learning a local denoising process that can then be exploited at inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 image classification benchmarks. Our results show that NoProp is a viable learning algorithm, is easy to use and computationally efficient. By departing from the traditional learning paradigm which requires back-propagating a global error signal, NoProp alters how credit assignment is done within the network, enabling more efficient distributed learning as well as potentially impacting other characteristics of the learning process.

Abstract: Despite the advantages of discriminative prototype-based methods, their role in adversarial robustness remains underexplored. Meanwhile, current adversarial training methods predominantly focus on robustness against adversarial attacks without explicitly leveraging geometric structures in the latent space, usually resulting in reduced accuracy on the original clean data. We propose a novel framework named Adversarially trained Deep Positive-Negative Prototypes (Adv-DPNP), which integrates discriminative prototype-based learning with adversarial training. Adv-DPNP uses unified class prototypes that serve as both classifier weights and robust anchors in the latent space. Moreover, a novel dual-branch training mechanism maintains stable prototypes by updating them exclusively with clean data, while the feature extractor is trained on both clean and adversarial inputs to increase invariance to adversarial perturbations. In addition, we use a composite loss that combines positive-prototype alignment, negative-prototype repulsion, and consistency regularization to further enhance discrimination, adversarial robustness, and clean accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN) confirm that Adv-DPNP improves clean accuracy over state-of-the-art defenses and baseline methods, while maintaining competitive or superior robustness under a suite of widely used attacks, including FGSM, PGD, C\&amp;W, and AutoAttack. We also evaluate robustness to common corruptions on CIFAR-10-C, where Adv-DPNP achieves the highest average accuracy across severities and corruption types. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the discriminative quality of the learned feature representations, highlighting the effectiveness of Adv-DPNP in maintaining compactness and clear separation in the latent space.

Abstract: We propose LauraTSE, an Auto-Regressive Decoder-Only Language Model for Target Speaker Extraction built upon the LauraGPT backbone. LauraTSE employs a small-scale auto-regressive decoder-only language model that generates the initial layers of the target speech's discrete codec representations from the continuous embeddings of both the mixture and reference speech. These outputs serve as coarse-grained predictions. To refine them, a one-step encoder-only language model reconstructs the full codec representation by integrating information from both the mixture and the reference speech, adding fine-grained details. Experimental results show that our approach can achieve promising performance. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to investigate the data scalability and the contribution of the encoder-only model.

Abstract: While long context support of large language models has extended their abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value tokens on top of attention-based eviction scores in closed-form. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

Abstract: We investigate reinforcement learning (RL) for privileged planning in autonomous driving. State-of-the-art approaches for this task are rule-based, but these methods do not scale to the long tail. RL, on the other hand, is scalable and does not suffer from compounding errors like imitation learning. Contemporary RL approaches for driving use complex shaped rewards that sum multiple individual rewards, \eg~progress, position, or orientation rewards. We show that PPO fails to optimize a popular version of these rewards when the mini-batch size is increased, which limits the scalability of these approaches. Instead, we propose a new reward design based primarily on optimizing a single intuitive reward term: route completion. Infractions are penalized by terminating the episode or multiplicatively reducing route completion. We find that PPO scales well with higher mini-batch sizes when trained with our simple reward, even improving performance. Training with large mini-batch sizes enables efficient scaling via distributed data parallelism. We scale PPO to 300M samples in CARLA and 500M samples in nuPlan with a single 8-GPU node. The resulting model achieves 64 DS on the CARLA longest6 v2 benchmark, outperforming other RL methods with more complex rewards by a large margin. Requiring only minimal adaptations from its use in CARLA, the same method is the best learning-based approach on nuPlan. It scores 91.3 in non-reactive and 90.6 in reactive traffic on the Val14 benchmark while being an order of magnitude faster than prior work.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve high performance across many domains but can still face challenges in generalization when optimization is influenced by small or noisy gradient components. Sharpness-Aware Minimization improves generalization by perturbing parameters toward directions of high curvature, but it uses the entire gradient vector, which means that small or noisy components may affect the ascent step and cause the optimizer to miss optimal solutions. We propose Z-Score Filtered Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which applies Z-score based filtering to gradients in each layer. Instead of using all gradient components, a mask is constructed to retain only the top percentile with the largest absolute Z-scores. The percentile threshold $Q_p$ determines how many components are kept, so that the ascent step focuses on directions that stand out most compared to the average of the layer. This selective perturbation refines the search toward flatter minima while reducing the influence of less significant gradients. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with architectures including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that the proposed method consistently improves test accuracy compared to Sharpness-Aware Minimization and its variants.

Abstract: Estimating parameters from samples of an optimal probability distribution is essential in applications ranging from socio-economic modeling to biological system analysis. In these settings, the probability distribution arises as the solution to an optimization problem that captures either static interactions among agents or the dynamic evolution of a system over time. We introduce a general methodology based on a new class of loss functions, called sharpened Fenchel-Young losses, which measure the sub-optimality gap of the optimization problem over the space of probability measures. We provide explicit stability guarantees for two relevant settings in the context of optimal transport: The first is inverse unbalanced optimal transport (iUOT) with entropic regularization, where the parameters to estimate are cost functions that govern transport computations; this method has applications such as link prediction in machine learning. The second is inverse gradient flow (iJKO), where the objective is to recover a potential function that drives the evolution of a probability distribution via the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) time-discretization scheme; this is particularly relevant for understanding cell population dynamics in single-cell genomics. We also establish source conditions to ensure stability of our method under mirror stratifiable regularizers (such as l1 or nuclear norm) that promote structure. Finally, we present optimization algorithms specifically tailored to efficiently solve iUOT and iJKO problems. We validate our approach through numerical experiments on Gaussian distributions, where closed-form solutions are available, to demonstrate the practical performance of our methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel unsupervised framework for \emph{Invariant Risk Minimization} (IRM), extending the concept of invariance to settings where labels are unavailable. Traditional IRM methods rely on labeled data to learn representations that are robust to distributional shifts across environments. In contrast, our approach redefines invariance through feature distribution alignment, enabling robust representation learning from unlabeled data. We introduce two methods within this framework: Principal Invariant Component Analysis (PICA), a linear method that extracts invariant directions under Gaussian assumptions, and Variational Invariant Autoencoder (VIAE), a deep generative model that disentangles environment-invariant and environment-dependent latent factors. Our approach is based on a novel ``unsupervised'' structural causal model and supports environment-conditioned sample-generation and intervention. Empirical evaluations on synthetic dataset and modified versions of MNIST demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in capturing invariant structure, preserving relevant information, and generalizing across environments without access to labels.

Abstract: To improve the training efficiency of federated learning (FL), previous research has employed low-rank decomposition techniques to reduce communication overhead. In this paper, we seek to enhance the performance of these low-rank decomposition methods. Specifically, we focus on three key issues related to decomposition in FL: what to decompose, how to decompose, and how to aggregate. Subsequently, we introduce three novel techniques: Model Update Decomposition (MUD), Block-wise Kronecker Decomposition (BKD), and Aggregation-Aware Decomposition (AAD), each targeting a specific issue. These techniques are complementary and can be applied simultaneously to achieve optimal performance. Additionally, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to ensure the convergence of the proposed MUD. Extensive experimental results show that our approach achieves faster convergence and superior accuracy compared to relevant baseline methods.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. In standard LoRA layers, one of the matrices, $A$ or $B$, is initialized to zero, ensuring that fine-tuning starts from the pretrained model. However, there is no theoretical support for this practice. In this paper, we investigate the impact of non-zero initialization on LoRA's fine-tuning dynamics from an infinite-width perspective. Our analysis reveals that, compared to zero initialization, simultaneously initializing $A$ and $B$ to non-zero values improves LoRA's robustness to suboptimal learning rates, particularly smaller ones. Further analysis indicates that although the non-zero initialization of $AB$ introduces random noise into the pretrained weight, it generally does not affect fine-tuning performance. In other words, fine-tuning does not need to strictly start from the pretrained model. The validity of our findings is confirmed through extensive experiments across various models and datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Leopold1423/non_zero_lora-icml25.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the discovery of novel chemicals and materials. However, scaling these discoveries to industrial production remains a major bottleneck due to the synthesis gap -- the need to develop entirely new manufacturing processes. This challenge requires detailed engineering blueprints: PFDs for equipment layouts and material/energy flows, and PIDs for process plant operations. Current AI systems cannot yet reliably generate these critical engineering schematics, creating a fundamental obstacle to manufacturing scale-up of novel discoveries. We present a closed-loop, physics-aware framework for automated generation of industrially viable PFDs and PIDs. The framework integrates three key components: (1) domain-specialized small language models (SLMs) trained for auto-generation of PFDs and PIDs, (2) a hierarchical knowledge graph containing process flow and instrumentation descriptions for 1,020+ chemicals for Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG), and (3) an open-source chemical process simulator for modeling, simulation, optimization, and analysis of novel chemical processes. The SLMs are trained through a multi-stage pipeline on synthetic datasets, with process simulator-in-the-loop validation ensuring feasibility. To enhance computational efficiency, the framework implements structural pruning (width and depth) guided by importance heuristics to reduce language model size while preserving accuracy, followed by advanced inference optimizations including FlashAttention, Lookahead Decoding, PagedAttention with KV-cache quantization, and Test-Time Inference Scaling. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework generates simulator-validated process descriptions with high fidelity.

Abstract: Previous research has sought to enhance the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs by supervised fine-tuning on synthetic graph data. While these led to specialized LLMs better at solving graph algorithm problems, we don't need LLMs for shortest path: we need generalization from synthetic graph data to real-world tasks with implicit graph structures. In this work, we propose to unlock generalizable learning of graph with post-training alignment with synthetic data. We first design solution-based and process-based rewards for synthetic graph problems: instead of rigid memorizing response patterns in direct fine-tuning, we posit that post-training alignment would help LLMs grasp the essentials underlying graph reasoning and alleviate overfitting on synthetic data. We employ post-training alignment algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, aligning both off-the-shelf LLMs and LLMs fine-tuned on synthetic graph data. We then compare them against existing settings on both in-domain synthetic tasks and out-of-domain real-world tasks with implicit graph structures such as multi-hop QA, structured planning, and more. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our post-training alignment recipe leads to statistically significant improvement on 5 datasets, with an average gain of 12.9% over baseline settings. Further analysis reveals that process-based rewards consistently outperform solution-based rewards on synthetic data but not on real-world tasks, and compositionality and explainable intermediate steps remains a critical challenge even after post-training alignment.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE), an ensemble of specialized models equipped with a router that dynamically distributes each input to appropriate experts, has achieved successful results in the field of machine learning. However, theoretical understanding of this architecture is falling behind due to its inherent complexity. In this paper, we theoretically study the sample and runtime complexity of MoE following the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) when learning a regression task with an underlying cluster structure of single index models. On the one hand, we prove that a vanilla neural network fails in detecting such a latent organization as it can only process the problem as a whole. This is intrinsically related to the concept of information exponent which is low for each cluster, but increases when we consider the entire task. On the other hand, we show that a MoE succeeds in dividing this problem into easier subproblems by leveraging the ability of each expert to weakly recover the simpler function corresponding to an individual cluster. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to explore the benefits of the MoE framework by examining its SGD dynamics in the context of nonlinear regression.

Abstract: Failure triage in design functional verification is critical but time-intensive, relying on manual specification reviews, log inspections, and waveform analyses. While machine learning (ML) has improved areas like stimulus generation and coverage closure, its application to RTL-level simulation failure triage, particularly for large designs, remains limited. VCDiag offers an efficient, adaptable approach using VCD data to classify failing waveforms and pinpoint likely failure locations. In the largest experiment, VCDiag achieves over 94% accuracy in identifying the top three most likely modules. The framework introduces a novel signal selection and statistical compression approach, achieving over 120x reduction in raw data size while preserving features essential for classification. It can also be integrated into diverse Verilog/SystemVerilog designs and testbenches.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize \emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem influence the transition.

Abstract: Agentic AI aims to create systems that set their own goals, adapt proactively to change, and refine behavior through continuous experience. Recent advances suggest that, when facing multiple and unforeseen tasks, agents could benefit from sharing machine-learned knowledge and reuse policies that have already been fully or partially learned by other agents. However, how to query, select, and retrieve policies from a pool of agents, and how to integrate such policies remains a largely unexplored area. This study explores how an agent decides what knowledge to select, from whom, and when and how to integrate it in its own policy in order to accelerate its own learning. The proposed algorithm, \emph{Modular Sharing and Composition in Collective Learning} (MOSAIC), improves learning in agentic collectives by combining (1) knowledge selection using performance signals and cosine similarity on Wasserstein task embeddings, (2) modular and transferable neural representations via masks, and (3) policy integration, composition and fine-tuning. MOSAIC outperforms isolated learners and global sharing approaches in both learning speed and overall performance, and in some cases solves tasks that isolated agents cannot. The results also demonstrate that selective, goal-driven reuse leads to less susceptibility to task interference. We also observe the emergence of self-organization, where agents solving simpler tasks accelerate the learning of harder ones through shared knowledge.

Abstract: While denoising diffusion and flow matching have driven major advances in generative modeling, their application to tabular data remains limited, despite its ubiquity in real-world applications. To this end, we develop TabbyFlow, a variational Flow Matching (VFM) method for tabular data generation. To apply VFM to data with mixed continuous and discrete features, we introduce Exponential Family Variational Flow Matching (EF-VFM), which represents heterogeneous data types using a general exponential family distribution. We hereby obtain an efficient, data-driven objective based on moment matching, enabling principled learning of probability paths over mixed continuous and discrete variables. We also establish a connection between variational flow matching and generalized flow matching objectives based on Bregman divergences. Evaluation on tabular data benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance compared to baselines.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature, comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO.

<title>Eigenspectrum Analysis of Neural Networks without Aspect Ratio Bias</title>

Abstract: Diagnosing deep neural networks (DNNs) by analyzing the eigenspectrum of their weights has been an active area of research in recent years. One of the main approaches involves measuring the heavytailness of the empirical spectral densities (ESDs) of weight matrices. This analysis has been shown to provide insights to help diagnose whether a model is well-trained or undertrained, and has been used to guide training methods involving layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. In this paper, we address an often-overlooked challenge in estimating the heavytailness of these ESDs: the impact of the aspect ratio of weight matrices. We demonstrate that matrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias in estimating the heavytailness of ESDs, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose FARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the weight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead of measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD of these subsampled submatrices. We show that this method effectively mitigates the aspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization techniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of weights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models, scientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model (LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly improves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. In one of the LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model by 17.3% when compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Automated driving (AD) has substantially improved vehicle safety and driving comfort, but their impact on passenger well-being, particularly infant sleep, is not sufficiently studied. Sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, and sharp maneuvers can disrupt infant sleep, compromising both passenger comfort and parental convenience. To solve this problem, this paper explores the integration of reinforcement learning (RL) within AD to personalize driving behavior and optimally balance occupant comfort and travel efficiency. In particular, we propose an intelligent cruise control framework that adapts to varying driving conditions to enhance infant sleep quality by effectively synergizing wearable sensing and vehicle data. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer-based neural networks are integrated with RL to model the relationship between driving behavior and infant sleep quality under diverse traffic and road conditions. Based on the sleep quality indicators from the wearable sensors, driving action data from vehicle controllers, and map data from map applications, the model dynamically computes the optimal driving aggressiveness level, which is subsequently translated into specific AD control strategies, e.g., the magnitude and frequency of acceleration, lane change, and overtaking. Simulation experiments conducted in the CARLA environment indicate that the proposed solution significantly improves infant sleep quality compared to baseline methods, while preserving desirable travel efficiency.

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban planning, transportation optimization, and personalized services. However, the inherent randomness, non-uniform time intervals, and complex patterns of human mobility, compounded by the heterogeneity introduced by varying city structures, infrastructure, and population densities, present significant challenges in modeling. Existing solutions often require training separate models for each city due to distinct spatial representations and geographic coverage. In this paper, we propose UniMove, a unified model for multi-city human mobility prediction, addressing two challenges: (1) constructing universal spatial representations for effective token sharing across cities, and (2) modeling heterogeneous mobility patterns from varying city characteristics. We propose a trajectory-location dual-tower architecture, with a location tower for universal spatial encoding and a trajectory tower for sequential mobility modeling. We also design MoE Transformer blocks to adaptively select experts to handle diverse movement patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets from diverse cities demonstrate that UniMove truly embodies the essence of a unified model. By enabling joint training on multi-city data with mutual data enhancement, it significantly improves mobility prediction accuracy by over 10.2\%. UniMove represents a key advancement toward realizing a true foundational model with a unified architecture for human mobility. We release the implementation at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UniMove/.

Abstract: Applying Gaussian processes (GPs) to very large datasets remains a challenge due to limited computational scalability. Matrix structures, such as the Kronecker product, can accelerate operations significantly, but their application commonly entails approximations or unrealistic assumptions. In particular, the most common path to creating a Kronecker-structured kernel matrix is by evaluating a product kernel on gridded inputs that can be expressed as a Cartesian product. However, this structure is lost if any observation is missing, breaking the Cartesian product structure, which frequently occurs in real-world data such as time series. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging latent Kronecker structure, by expressing the kernel matrix of observed values as the projection of a latent Kronecker product. In combination with iterative linear system solvers and pathwise conditioning, our method facilitates inference of exact GPs while requiring substantially fewer computational resources than standard iterative methods. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art sparse and variational GPs on real-world datasets with up to five million examples, including robotics, automated machine learning, and climate applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize parts of their training data, raising important concerns around privacy and security. While previous research has focused on studying memorization in pre-trained models, much less is known about how knowledge distillation (KD) affects memorization.In this study, we explore how different KD methods influence the memorization of fine-tuned task data when a large teacher model is distilled into smaller student variants.This study demonstrates that distilling a larger teacher model, fine-tuned on a dataset, into a smaller variant not only lowers computational costs and model size but also significantly reduces the memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: We present a formal operator-theoretic framework for analyzing Transformer-based language models using free probability theory. By modeling token embeddings and attention mechanisms as self-adjoint operators in a tracial \( W^* \)-probability space, we reinterpret attention as non-commutative convolution and describe representation propagation via free additive convolution. This leads to a spectral dynamic system interpretation of deep Transformers. We derive entropy-based generalization bounds under freeness assumptions and provide insight into positional encoding, spectral evolution, and representational complexity. This work offers a principled, though theoretical, perspective on structural dynamics in large language models.

Abstract: We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models, or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on uncontrolled generation and outperforming state-of-the-art models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and in the Bayesian inference setting. This work strengthens the connection between flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, offering a scalable and principled framework for constraint-driven and symmetry-aware generation.

Abstract: Efficient long-context modeling remains a critical challenge for natural language processing (NLP), as the time complexity of the predominant Transformer architecture scales quadratically with the sequence length. While state-space models (SSMs) offer alternative sub-quadratic solutions, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively. In this work, we focus on analyzing and improving the long-context modeling capabilities of SSMs. We show that the widely used synthetic task, associative recall, which requires a model to recall a value associated with a single key without context, insufficiently represents the complexities of real-world long-context modeling. To address this limitation, we extend the associative recall to a novel synthetic task, \emph{joint recall}, which requires a model to recall the value associated with a key given in a specified context. Theoretically, we prove that SSMs do not have the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall in sub-quadratic time complexity. To resolve this issue, we propose a solution based on integrating SSMs with Context-Dependent Sparse Attention (CDSA), which has the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall with sub-quadratic computation. To bridge the gap between theoretical analysis and real-world applications, we propose locality-sensitive Hashing Attention with sparse Key Selection (HAX), which instantiates the theoretical solution and is further tailored to natural language domains. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world long-context benchmarks show that HAX consistently outperforms SSM baselines and SSMs integrated with context-independent sparse attention (CISA).

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the semantic knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drift occurs, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate the challenge of poor semantic knowledge caused by label signal disruption. Furthermore, we design a frequency alignment to address spectral client drift. The combination of Spatial and Spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

Abstract: We propose AdaMuon, a novel optimizer that combines element-wise adaptivity with orthogonal updates for large-scale neural network training. AdaMuon incorporates two tightly coupled mechanisms: (1) an element-wise second momentum estimator applied to orthogonalized update directions, and (2) a sign-stabilized orthogonal update, where the momentum is first sign-transformed before orthogonalization. These two components jointly enable variance-adaptive scaling while maintaining stable update geometry. In addition, AdaMuon employs an RMS-aligned rescaling strategy to match the root-mean-square update magnitude to Adam, allowing direct reuse of existing learning rate schedules without extra tuning. Experiments demonstrate that AdaMuon not only maintains stability but can surpass Adam by more than 40% training efficiency in large-scale scenarios.

Abstract: Ensuring that neural models used in real-world applications cannot infer sensitive information, such as demographic attributes like gender or race, from text representations is a critical challenge when fairness is a concern. We address this issue through concept erasure, a process that removes information related to a specific concept from distributed representations while preserving as much of the remaining semantic information as possible. Our approach involves learning an orthogonal projection in the embedding space, designed to make the class-conditional feature distributions of the discrete concept to erase indistinguishable after projection. By adjusting the rank of the projector, we control the extent of information removal, while its orthogonality ensures strict preservation of the local structure of the embeddings. Our method, termed $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD, achieves state-of-the-art performance in nonlinear erasure of a discrete attribute on classic natural language processing benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD effectively mitigates bias in deep nonlinear classifiers, thereby promoting fairness.

Abstract: We address the problem of safe policy learning in multi-agent safety-critical autonomous systems. In such systems, it is necessary for each agent to meet the safety requirements at all times while also cooperating with other agents to accomplish the task. Toward this end, we propose a safe Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HMARL) approach based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Our proposed hierarchical approach decomposes the overall reinforcement learning problem into two levels learning joint cooperative behavior at the higher level and learning safe individual behavior at the lower or agent level conditioned on the high-level policy. Specifically, we propose a skill-based HMARL-CBF algorithm in which the higher level problem involves learning a joint policy over the skills for all the agents and the lower-level problem involves learning policies to execute the skills safely with CBFs. We validate our approach on challenging environment scenarios whereby a large number of agents have to safely navigate through conflicting road networks. Compared with existing state of the art methods, our approach significantly improves the safety achieving near perfect (within 5%) success/safety rate while also improving performance across all the environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advanced linguistic capabilities, fundamentally lack an intuitive understanding of physical dynamics, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that require causal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Causal World Model Induction (CWMI), a novel framework designed to embed an explicit model of causal physics within an LLM. Our approach incorporates a dedicated Causal Physics Module (CPM) and a new training objective called Causal Intervention Loss, encouraging the model to learn cause-and-effect relationships from multimodal data. By training the model to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely capturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal representation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning tasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench dataset. These findings demonstrate that inducing a causal world model is a critical step toward more reliable and generalizable AI systems.

Abstract: We formalize sequential decision-making with information acquisition as the probing-augmented user-centric selection (PUCS) framework, where a learner first probes a subset of arms to obtain side information on resources and rewards, and then assigns $K$ plays to $M$ arms. PUCS covers applications such as ridesharing, wireless scheduling, and content recommendation, in which both resources and payoffs are initially unknown and probing is costly. For the offline setting with known distributions, we present a greedy probing algorithm with a constant-factor approximation guarantee $\zeta = (e-1)/(2e-1)$. For the online setting with unknown distributions, we introduce OLPA, a stochastic combinatorial bandit algorithm that achieves a regret bound $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} + \ln^{2} T)$. We also prove a lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$, showing that the upper bound is tight up to logarithmic factors. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions.

Abstract: LLMs enable qualitative coding at large scale, but assessing reliability remains challenging where human experts seldom agree. We investigate confidence-diversity calibration as a quality assessment framework for accessible coding tasks where LLMs already demonstrate strong performance but exhibit overconfidence. Analysing 5,680 coding decisions from eight state-of-the-art LLMs across ten categories, we find that mean self-confidence tracks inter-model agreement closely (Pearson r=0.82). Adding model diversity quantified as normalised Shannon entropy produces a dual signal explaining agreement almost completely (R-squared=0.979), though this high predictive power likely reflects task simplicity for current LLMs. The framework enables a three-tier workflow auto-accepting 35 percent of segments with less than 5 percent error, cutting manual effort by 65 percent. Cross-domain validation confirms transferability (kappa improvements of 0.20 to 0.78). While establishing a methodological foundation for AI judgement calibration, the true potential likely lies in more challenging scenarios where LLMs may demonstrate comparative advantages over human cognitive limitations.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of biological neurons, offer a distinctive approach for capturing the complexities of temporal data. However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation (OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA) hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers, enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF) Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient spatial-temporal modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential for antibody design, yet existing approaches apply uniform generation strategies that cannot adapt to each antigen's unique requirements. Inspired by B cell affinity maturation, where antibodies evolve through multi-objective optimization balancing affinity, stability, and self-avoidance, we propose the first biologically-motivated framework that leverages physics-based domain knowledge within an online meta-learning system. Our method employs multiple specialized experts (van der Waals, molecular recognition, energy balance, and interface geometry) whose parameters evolve during generation based on iterative feedback, mimicking natural antibody refinement cycles. Instead of fixed protocols, this adaptive guidance discovers personalized optimization strategies for each target. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach: (1) discovers optimal SE(3)-equivariant guidance strategies for different antigen classes without pre-training, preserving molecular symmetries throughout optimization; (2) significantly enhances hotspot coverage and interface quality through target-specific adaptation, achieving balanced multi-objective optimization characteristic of therapeutic antibodies; (3) establishes a paradigm for iterative refinement where each antibody-antigen system learns its unique optimization profile through online evaluation; (4) generalizes effectively across diverse design challenges, from small epitopes to large protein interfaces, enabling precision-focused campaigns for individual targets.

Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec) methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.

Abstract: Learning interpretable latent representations from tabular data remains a challenge in deep generative modeling. We introduce SE-VAE (Structural Equation-Variational Autoencoder), a novel architecture that embeds measurement structure directly into the design of a variational autoencoder. Inspired by structural equation modeling, SE-VAE aligns latent subspaces with known indicator groupings and introduces a global nuisance latent to isolate construct-specific confounding variation. This modular architecture enables disentanglement through design rather than through statistical regularizers alone. We evaluate SE-VAE on a suite of simulated tabular datasets and benchmark its performance against a series of leading baselines using standard disentanglement metrics. SE-VAE consistently outperforms alternatives in factor recovery, interpretability, and robustness to nuisance variation. Ablation results reveal that architectural structure, rather than regularization strength, is the key driver of performance. SE-VAE offers a principled framework for white-box generative modeling in scientific and social domains where latent constructs are theory-driven and measurement validity is essential.

Abstract: Communication overhead is one of the major obstacles to train large deep learning models at scale. Gradient sparsification is a promising technique to reduce the communication volume. However, it is very challenging to obtain real performance improvement because of (1) the difficulty of achieving an scalable and efficient sparse allreduce algorithm and (2) the sparsification overhead. This paper proposes O$k$-Top$k$, a scheme for distributed training with sparse gradients. O$k$-Top$k$ integrates a novel sparse allreduce algorithm (less than 6$k$ communication volume which is asymptotically optimal) with the decentralized parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer, and its convergence is proved. To reduce the sparsification overhead, O$k$-Top$k$ efficiently selects the top-$k$ gradient values according to an estimated threshold. Evaluations are conducted on the Piz Daint supercomputer with neural network models from different deep learning domains. Empirical results show that O$k$-Top$k$ achieves similar model accuracy to dense allreduce. Compared with the optimized dense and the state-of-the-art sparse allreduces, O$k$-Top$k$ is more scalable and significantly improves training throughput (e.g., 3.29x-12.95x improvement for BERT on 256 GPUs).

Abstract: Transformer-based self-supervised models have achieved remarkable success in speech processing, but their large size and high inference cost present significant challenges for real-world deployment. While numerous compression techniques have been proposed, inconsistent evaluation metrics make it difficult to compare their practical effectiveness. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of four common compression methods, including weight pruning, head pruning, low-rank approximation, and knowledge distillation on self-supervised speech Transformers. We evaluate each method under three key metrics: parameter count, multiply-accumulate operations, and real-time factor. Results show that each method offers distinct advantages. In addition, we contextualize recent compression techniques, comparing DistilHuBERT, FitHuBERT, LightHuBERT, ARMHuBERT, and STaRHuBERT under the same framework, offering practical guidance on compression for deployment.

Abstract: We provide uniform confidence bands for kernel ridge regression (KRR), a widely used nonparametric regression estimator for nonstandard data such as preferences, sequences, and graphs. Despite the prevalence of these data--e.g., student preferences in school matching mechanisms--the inferential theory of KRR is not fully known. We construct valid and sharp confidence sets that shrink at nearly the minimax rate, allowing nonstandard regressors. Our bootstrap procedure uses anti-symmetric multipliers for computational efficiency and for validity under mis-specification. We use the procedure to develop a test for match effects, i.e. whether students benefit more from the schools they rank highly.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of driving environments and the presence of diverse road users pose significant challenges for decision-making in autonomous driving. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a popular approach to tackle this problem. However, the application of existing DRL solutions is mainly confined to simulated environments due to safety concerns, impeding their deployment in real-world. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel neuro-symbolic model-free DRL approach, called DRL with Symbolic Logic (DRLSL) that combines the strengths of DRL (learning from experience) and symbolic first-order logic (knowledge-driven reasoning) to enable safe learning in real-time interactions of autonomous driving within real environments. This innovative approach provides a means to learn autonomous driving policies by actively engaging with the physical environment while ensuring safety. We have implemented the DRLSL framework in a highway driving scenario using the HighD dataset and demonstrated that our method successfully avoids unsafe actions during both the training and testing phases. Furthermore, our results indicate that DRLSL achieves faster convergence during training and exhibits better generalizability to new highway driving scenarios compared to traditional DRL methods.

<title>Learning Zero-Sum Linear Quadratic Games with Improved Sample Complexity and Last-Iterate Convergence</title>

Abstract: Zero-sum Linear Quadratic (LQ) games are fundamental in optimal control and can be used (i)~as a dynamic game formulation for risk-sensitive or robust control and (ii)~as a benchmark setting for multi-agent reinforcement learning with two competing agents in continuous state-control spaces. In contrast to the well-studied single-agent linear quadratic regulator problem, zero-sum LQ games entail solving a challenging nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problem with an objective function that lacks coercivity. Recently, Zhang et al. showed that an~$\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium (NE) of finite horizon zero-sum LQ games can be learned via nested model-free Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) algorithms with poly$(1/\epsilon)$ sample complexity. In this work, we propose a simpler nested Zeroth-Order (ZO) algorithm improving sample complexity by several orders of magnitude and guaranteeing convergence of the last iterate. Our main results are two-fold: (i) in the deterministic setting, we establish the first global last-iterate linear convergence result for the nested algorithm that seeks NE of zero-sum LQ games; (ii) in the model-free setting, we establish a~$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity using a single-point ZO estimator. For our last-iterate convergence results, our analysis leverages the Implicit Regularization (IR) property and a new gradient domination condition for the primal function. Our key improvements in the sample complexity rely on a more sample-efficient nested algorithm design and a finer control of the ZO natural gradient estimation error utilizing the structure endowed by the finite-horizon setting.

Abstract: Analysis of high-dimensional data has led to increased interest in both single index models (SIMs) and the best-subset selection. SIMs provide an interpretable and flexible modeling framework for high-dimensional data, while the best-subset selection aims to find a sparse model from a large set of predictors. However, the best-subset selection in high-dimensional models is known to be computationally intractable. Existing proxy algorithms are appealing but do not yield the bestsubset solution. In this paper, we directly tackle the intractability by proposing a provably scalable algorithm for the best-subset selection in high-dimensional SIMs. We directly proved the subset selection consistency and oracle property for our algorithmic solution, distinguishing it from other state-of-the-art support recovery methods in SIMs. The algorithm comprises a generalized information criterion to determine the support size of the regression coefficients, eliminating the model selection tuning. Moreover, our method does not assume an error distribution or a specific link function and hence is flexible to apply. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our method is not only computationally efficient but also able to exactly recover the best subset in various settings (e.g., linear regression, Poisson regression, heteroscedastic models).

Abstract: Accurate teeth segmentation and orientation are fundamental in modern oral healthcare, enabling precise diagnosis, treatment planning, and dental implant design. In this study, we present a comprehensive approach to teeth segmentation and orientation from panoramic X-ray images, leveraging deep-learning techniques. We built an end-to-end instance segmentation network that uses an encoder-decoder architecture reinforced with grid-aware attention gates along the skip connections. We introduce oriented bounding box (OBB) generation through principal component analysis (PCA) for precise tooth orientation estimation. Evaluating our approach on the publicly available DNS dataset, comprising 543 panoramic X-ray images, we achieve the highest Intersection-over-Union (IoU) score of 82.43% and a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) score of 90.37% among compared models in teeth instance segmentation. In OBB analysis, we obtain a Rotated IoU (RIoU) score of 82.82%. We also conduct detailed analyses of individual tooth labels and categorical performance, shedding light on strengths and weaknesses. The proposed model's accuracy and versatility offer promising prospects for improving dental diagnoses, treatment planning, and personalized healthcare in the oral domain. Our generated OBB coordinates and code are available at https://github.com/mrinal054/Instance/teeth/segmentation.

Abstract: Prompt engineering is an effective but labor-intensive way to control text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Its time-intensive nature and complexity have spurred the development of algorithms for automated prompt generation. However, these methods often struggle with transferability across T2I models, require white-box access to the underlying model, or produce non-intuitive prompts. In this work, we introduce PRISM, an algorithm that automatically produces human-interpretable and transferable prompts that can effectively generate desired concepts given only black-box access to T2I models. Inspired by large language model (LLM) jailbreaking, PRISM leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs to iteratively refine the candidate prompt distribution built upon the reference images. Our experiments demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of PRISM in generating accurate prompts for objects, styles, and images across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney.

Abstract: Optimization drives advances in quantum science and machine learning, yet most generative models aim to mimic data rather than to discover optimal answers to challenging problems. Here we present a variational generative optimization network that learns to map simple random inputs into high quality solutions across a variety of quantum tasks. We demonstrate that the network rapidly identifies entangled states exhibiting an optimal advantage in entanglement detection when allowing classical communication, attains the ground state energy of an eighteen spin model without encountering the barren plateau phenomenon that hampers standard hybrid algorithms, and-after a single training run-outputs multiple orthogonal ground states of degenerate quantum models. Because the method is model agnostic, parallelizable and runs on current classical hardware, it can accelerate future variational optimization problems in quantum information, quantum computing and beyond.

Abstract: Continuous Conditional Generative Modeling (CCGM) estimates high-dimensional data distributions, such as images, conditioned on scalar continuous variables (aka regression labels). While Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CcGANs) were designed for this task, their instability during adversarial learning often leads to suboptimal results. Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) offer a promising alternative, generating more realistic images, but their diffusion processes, label conditioning, and model fitting procedures are either not optimized for or incompatible with CCGM, making it difficult to integrate CcGANs' vicinal approach. To address these issues, we introduce Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models (CCDMs), the first CDM specifically tailored for CCGM. CCDMs address existing limitations with specially designed conditional diffusion processes, a novel hard vicinal image denoising loss, a customized label embedding method, and efficient conditional sampling procedures. Through comprehensive experiments on four datasets with resolutions ranging from 64x64 to 192x192, we demonstrate that CCDMs outperform state-of-the-art CCGM models, establishing a new benchmark. Ablation studies further validate the model design and implementation, highlighting that some widely used CDM implementations are ineffective for the CCGM task. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/UBCDingXin/CCDM.

Abstract: Despite advancements in large language models (LLMs), non-factual responses still persist in fact-seeking question answering. Unlike extensive studies on post-hoc detection of these responses, this work studies non-factuality prediction (NFP), predicting whether an LLM will generate a non-factual response prior to the response generation. Previous NFP methods have shown LLMs' awareness of their knowledge, but they face challenges in terms of efficiency and transferability. In this work, we propose a lightweight model named Factuality Lens (FacLens), which effectively probes hidden representations of fact-seeking questions for the NFP task. Moreover, we discover that hidden question representations sourced from different LLMs exhibit similar NFP patterns, enabling the transferability of FacLens across different LLMs to reduce development costs. Extensive experiments highlight FacLens's superiority in both effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Transformer architectures rely on position encodings to model the spatial structure of input data. Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE) is a widely used method in language models that encodes relative positions through fixed, block-diagonal, rotation matrices applied to key-query interactions. We hypothesize that this inductive bias limits their RoPE's effectiveness for modalities with high dimensional structure. Lie Relative Encodings (LieRE) introduce a principled generalization of RoPE, aimed at increasing the representational capacity of positional encodings in transformers. Instead of fixed 2D rotations, LieRE learns dense skew-symmetric matrices (Lie algebra elements), which are then differentiable mapped to form high-dimensional rotation matrices (Lie group elements). This results in richer, learnable, and continuous, encodings of both relative and absolute positional information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LieRE on 2D and 3D vision tasks, showing that it generalizes well to higher input resolutions while maintaining computational efficiency. The code and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/LieRE.

Abstract: In the Naive Bayes classification model the class conditional densities are estimated as the products of their marginal densities along the cardinal basis directions. We study the problem of obtaining an alternative basis for this factorisation with the objective of enhancing the discriminatory power of the associated classification model. We formulate the problem as a projection pursuit to find the optimal linear projection on which to perform classification. Optimality is determined based on the multinomial likelihood within which probabilities are estimated using the Naive Bayes factorisation of the projected data. Projection pursuit offers the added benefits of dimension reduction and visualisation. We discuss an intuitive connection with class conditional independent components analysis, and show how this is realised visually in practical applications. The performance of the resulting classification models is investigated using a large collection of (162) publicly available benchmark data sets and in comparison with relevant alternatives. We find that the proposed approach substantially outperforms other popular probabilistic discriminant analysis models and is highly competitive with Support Vector Machines.
  Code to implement the proposed approach, in the form of an R package, is available from https://github.com/DavidHofmeyr/OPNB

Abstract: Singing voices contain much richer information than common voices, including varied vocal and acoustic properties. However, current open-source audio-text datasets for singing voices capture only a narrow range of attributes and lack acoustic features, leading to limited utility towards downstream tasks, such as style captioning. To fill this gap, we formally define the singing style captioning task and present S2Cap, a dataset of singing voices with detailed descriptions covering diverse vocal, acoustic, and demographic characteristics. Using this dataset, we develop an efficient and straightforward baseline algorithm for singing style captioning. The dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/records/15673764.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning (ICL), a supervised learning technique that relies on adding annotated examples to the model context. We investigate a contextual bandit version of in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL), where models learn in-context, online, from external reward, instead of supervised data. We show that LLMs effectively demonstrate such learning, and provide a detailed study of the phenomena, experimenting with challenging classification tasks and models of sizes from 500M to 70B parameters. This includes identifying and addressing the instability of the process, demonstrating learning with both semantic and abstract labels, and showing scaling trends. Our findings highlight ICRL capabilities in LLMs, while also underscoring fundamental limitations in their implicit reasoning about errors.

Abstract: Deep learning and contactless sensing technologies have significantly advanced the automated assessment of human behaviors in healthcare. In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), repetitive motor behaviors such as spinning, head banging, and arm flapping are key indicators for diagnosis. This study focuses on distinguishing between children with ASD and typically developed (TD) peers by analyzing videos captured in natural, uncontrolled environments. Using the publicly available Self-Stimulatory Behavior Dataset (SSBD), we address the classification task as a binary problem, ASD vs. TD, based on stereotypical repetitive gestures. We adopt a pipeline integrating YOLOv7-based detection, extensive video augmentations, and the VideoMAE framework, which efficiently captures both spatial and temporal features through a high-ratio masking and reconstruction strategy. Our proposed approach achieves 95% accuracy, 0.93 precision, 0.94 recall, and 0.94 F1 score, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by a significant margin. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining advanced object detection, robust data augmentation, and masked autoencoder-based video modeling for reliable ASD vs. TD classification in naturalistic settings.

Abstract: Differential privacy is the leading mathematical framework for privacy protection, providing a probabilistic guarantee that safeguards individuals' private information when publishing statistics from a dataset. This guarantee is achieved by applying a randomized algorithm to the original data, which introduces unique challenges in data analysis by distorting inherent patterns. In particular, causal inference using observational data in privacy-sensitive contexts is challenging because it requires covariate balance between treatment groups, yet checking the true covariates is prohibited to prevent leakage of sensitive information. In this article, we present a differentially private two-stage covariate balancing weighting estimator to infer causal effects from observational data. Our algorithm produces both point and interval estimators with statistical guarantees, such as consistency and rate optimality, under a given privacy budget.

<title>Emoji Attack: Enhancing Jailbreak Attacks Against Judge LLM Detection</title>

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques trick Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing restricted output, posing a potential threat. One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the unsafe prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.

<title>Regress, Don't Guess -- A Regression-like Loss on Number Tokens for Language Models</title>

Abstract: While language models have exceptional capabilities at text generation, they lack a natural inductive bias for emitting numbers and thus struggle in tasks involving quantitative reasoning, especially arithmetic. One fundamental limitation is the nature of the cross-entropy (CE) loss, which assumes a nominal scale and thus cannot convey proximity between generated number tokens. In response, we here present a regression-like loss that operates purely on token level. Our proposed Number Token Loss (NTL) comes in two flavors and minimizes either the $L_p$ norm or the Wasserstein distance between the numerical values of the real and predicted number tokens. NTL can easily be added to any language model and extend the CE objective during training without runtime overhead. We evaluate the proposed scheme on various mathematical datasets and find that it consistently improves performance in math-related tasks. In a direct comparison on a regression task, we find that NTL can match the performance of a regression head, despite operating on token level. Finally, we scale NTL up to 3B parameter models and observe improved performance, demonstrating its potential for seamless integration into LLMs. We hope to inspire LLM developers to improve their pretraining objectives and distribute NTL as a minimalistic and lightweight PyPI package $ntloss$: https://github.com/ai4sd/number-token-loss. Development code for full paper reproduction is available separately.

<title>Diagnostic performance of deep learning for predicting glioma isocitrate dehydrogenase and 1p/19q co-deletion in MRI: a systematic review and meta-analysis</title>

Abstract: Objectives We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of deep learning (DL)-based radiomics models for the noninvasive prediction of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion status in glioma patients using MRI sequences, and to identify methodological factors influencing accuracy and generalizability.
  Materials and methods Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched major databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) up to March 2025, screening studies that utilized DL to predict IDH and 1p/19q co-deletion status from MRI data. We assessed study quality and risk of bias using the Radiomics Quality Score and the QUADAS-2 tool. Our meta-analysis employed a bivariate model to compute pooled sensitivity and specificity, and meta-regression to assess interstudy heterogeneity.
  Results Among the 1517 unique publications, 104 were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 72 underwent meta-analysis. Pooled estimates for IDH prediction in test cohorts yielded a sensitivity of 0.80 and specificity of 0.85. For 1p/19q co-deletion, sensitivity was 0.75 and specificity was 0.82. Meta-regression identified the tumor segmentation method and the extent of DL integration into the radiomics pipeline as significant contributors to interstudy variability.
  Conclusion Although DL models demonstrate strong potential for noninvasive molecular classification of gliomas, clinical translation requires several critical steps: harmonization of multi-center MRI data using techniques such as histogram matching and DL-based style transfer; adoption of standardized and automated segmentation protocols; extensive multi-center external validation; and prospective clinical validation.

Abstract: We propose a novel design paradigm for arbitrarily capable deep photonic networks of cascaded Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs) for on-chip universal polarization handling. Using a device architecture made of cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers, we modify and train the phase difference between interferometer arms for both polarizations through wide operation bandwidths. Three proof-of-concept polarization handling devices are illustrated using a software-defined, physics-informed neural framework, to achieve user-specified target device responses as functions of polarization and wavelength. These devices include a polarization splitter, a polarization-independent power splitter, and an arbitrary polarization-dependent splitter to illustrate the capabilities of the design framework. The performance for all three devices is optimized using transfer matrix calculations; and their final responses are verified through 3D-FDTD simulations. All devices demonstrate state-of-the-art performance metrics with over 20 dB extinction, and flat-top transmission bands through bandwidths of 120 nm. In addition to the functional diversity enabled, the optimization for each device is completed in under a minute, highlighting the computational efficiency of the design paradigm presented. These results demonstrate the versatility of the deep photonic network design ecosystem in polarization management, unveiling promising prospects for advanced on-chip applications in optical communications, sensing, and computing.

Abstract: Neural Jump ODEs model the conditional expectation between observations by neural ODEs and jump at arrival of new observations. They have demonstrated effectiveness for fully data-driven online forecasting in settings with irregular and partial observations, operating under weak regularity assumptions. This work extends the framework to input-output systems, enabling direct applications in online filtering and classification. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for this approach, providing a robust solution to $L^2$-optimal filtering. Empirical experiments highlight the model's superior performance over classical parametric methods, particularly in scenarios with complex underlying distributions. These results emphasise the approach's potential in time-sensitive domains such as finance and health monitoring, where real-time accuracy is crucial.

<title>Benchmarking Federated Learning for Semantic Datasets: Federated Scene Graph Generation</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training while preserving data privacy, yet existing FL benchmarks address relatively simple classification tasks, where each sample is annotated with a one-hot label. However, little attention has been paid to demonstrating an FL benchmark that handles complicated semantics, where each sample encompasses diverse semantic information, such as relations between objects. Because the existing benchmarks are designed to distribute data in a narrow view of a single semantic, managing the complicated \textit{semantic heterogeneity} across clients when formalizing FL benchmarks is non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a benchmark process to establish an FL benchmark with controllable semantic heterogeneity across clients: two key steps are (i) data clustering with semantics and (ii) data distributing via controllable semantic heterogeneity across clients. As a proof of concept, we construct a federated PSG benchmark, demonstrating the efficacy of the existing PSG methods in an FL setting with controllable semantic heterogeneity of scene graphs. We also present the effectiveness of our benchmark by applying robust federated learning algorithms to data heterogeneity to show increased performance. To our knowledge, this is the first benchmark framework that enables federated learning and its evaluation for multi-semantic vision tasks under the controlled semantic heterogeneity. Our code is available at \textit{https://github.com/Seung-B/FL-PSG}.

<title>STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning</title>

Abstract: Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.

Abstract: Automated assessment of surgical skills using artificial intelligence (AI) provides trainees with instantaneous feedback. After bimanual tool motions are captured, derived kinematic metrics are reliable predictors of performance in laparoscopic tasks. Implementing automated tool tracking requires time-intensive human annotation. We developed AI-based tool tracking using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to eliminate the need for human annotators. Here, we describe a study evaluating the usefulness of our tool tracking model in automated assessment during a laparoscopic suturing task in the fundoplication procedure. An automated tool tracking model was applied to recorded videos of Nissen fundoplication on porcine bowel. Surgeons were grouped as novices (PGY1-2) and experts (PGY3-5, attendings). The beginning and end of each suturing step were segmented, and motions of the left and right tools were extracted. A low-pass filter with a 24 Hz cut-off frequency removed noise. Performance was assessed using supervised and unsupervised models, and an ablation study compared results. Kinematic features--RMS velocity, RMS acceleration, RMS jerk, total path length, and Bimanual Dexterity--were extracted and analyzed using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, and XGBoost. PCA was performed for feature reduction. For unsupervised learning, a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) model with classifiers, such as a 1-D CNN and traditional models, was trained. Data were extracted for 28 participants (9 novices, 19 experts). Supervised learning with PCA and Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 0.795 and an F1 score of 0.778. The unsupervised 1-D CNN achieved superior results with an accuracy of 0.817 and an F1 score of 0.806, eliminating the need for kinematic feature computation. We demonstrated an AI model capable of automated performance classification, independent of human annotation.

Abstract: Optimal transportation of raw material from suppliers to customers is an issue arising in logistics that is addressed here with a continuous model relying on optimal transport theory. A physics informed neuralnetwork method is advocated here for the solution of the corresponding generalized Monge-Amp`ere equation. Convex neural networks are advocated to enforce the convexity of the solution to the Monge-Amp\`ere equation and obtain a suitable approximation of the optimal transport map. A particular focus is set on the enforcement of transport boundary conditions in the loss function. Numerical experiments illustrate the solution to the optimal transport problem in several configurations, and sensitivity analyses are performed.

<title>2SSP: A Two-Stage Framework for Structured Pruning of LLMs</title>

arXiv:2501.17771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel Two-Stage framework for Structured Pruning (\textsc{2SSP}) for pruning Large Language Models (LLMs), which combines two different strategies of pruning, namely Width and Depth Pruning. The first stage (Width Pruning) removes entire neurons, hence their corresponding rows and columns, aiming to preserve the connectivity among the pruned structures in the intermediate state of the Feed-Forward Networks in each Transformer block. This is done based on an importance score measuring the impact of each neuron on the output magnitude. The second stage (Depth Pruning), instead, removes entire Attention submodules. This is done by applying an iterative process that removes the Attention with the minimum impact on a given metric of interest (in our case, perplexity). We also propose a novel mechanism to balance the sparsity rate of the two stages w.r.t. to the desired global sparsity. We test \textsc{2SSP} on four LLM families and three sparsity rates (25\%, 37.5\%, and 50\%), measuring the resulting perplexity over three language modeling datasets as well as the performance over six downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms five state-of-the-art competitors over three language modeling and six downstream tasks, with an up to two-order-of-magnitude gain in terms of pruning time. The code is available at https://github.com/FabrizioSandri/2SSP.

Abstract: Mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD) is an optimization method derived by taking the mean-field limit of noisy gradient descent for two-layer neural networks in the mean-field regime. Recently, the propagation of chaos (PoC) for MFLD has gained attention as it provides a quantitative characterization of the optimization complexity in terms of the number of particles and iterations. A remarkable progress by Chen et al. (2022) showed that the approximation error due to finite particles remains uniform in time and diminishes as the number of particles increases. In this paper, by refining the defective log-Sobolev inequality -- a key result from that earlier work -- under the neural network training setting, we establish an improved PoC result for MFLD, which removes the exponential dependence on the regularization coefficient from the particle approximation term of the optimization complexity. As an application, we propose a PoC-based model ensemble strategy with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We study the linear bandit problem that accounts for partially observable features. Without proper handling, unobserved features can lead to linear regret in the decision horizon $T$, as their influence on rewards is unknown. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel theoretical framework and an algorithm with sublinear regret guarantees. The core of our algorithm consists of (i) feature augmentation, by appending basis vectors that are orthogonal to the row space of the observed features; and (ii) the introduction of a doubly robust estimator. Our approach achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{(d + d_h)T})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the observed features and $d_h$ depends on the extent to which the unobserved feature space is contained in the observed one, thereby capturing the intrinsic difficulty of the problem. Notably, our algorithm requires no prior knowledge of the unobserved feature space, which may expand as more features become hidden. Numerical experiments confirm that our algorithm outperforms both non-contextual multi-armed bandits and linear bandit algorithms depending solely on observed features.

Abstract: Hate speech detection is a crucial task, especially on social media, where harmful content can spread quickly. Implementing machine learning models to automatically identify and address hate speech is essential for mitigating its impact and preventing its proliferation. The first step in developing an effective hate speech detection model is to acquire a high-quality dataset for training. Labeled data is essential for most natural language processing tasks, but categorizing hate speech is difficult due to the diverse and often subjective nature of hate speech, which can lead to varying interpretations and disagreements among annotators. This paper examines strategies for addressing annotator disagreement, an issue that has been largely overlooked. In particular, we evaluate various automatic approaches for aggregating multiple annotations, in the context of hate speech classification in Turkish tweets. Our work highlights the importance of the problem and provides state-of-the-art benchmark results for the detection and understanding of hate speech in online discourse.

Abstract: We derived the closed-form asymptotic optimism of linear regression models under random designs, and generalizes it to kernel ridge regression. Using scaled asymptotic optimism as a generic predictive model complexity measure, we studied the fundamental different behaviors of linear regression model, tangent kernel (NTK) regression model and three-layer fully connected neural networks (NN). Our contribution is two-fold: we provided theoretical ground for using scaled optimism as a model predictive complexity measure; and we show empirically that NN with ReLUs behaves differently from kernel models under this measure. With resampling techniques, we can also compute the optimism for regression models with real data.

arXiv:2502.13581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) is an emerging paradigm where user actions are tokenized into discrete token patterns and autoregressively generated as predictions. However, existing GR models tokenize each action independently, assigning the same fixed tokens to identical actions across all sequences without considering contextual relationships. This lack of context-awareness can lead to suboptimal performance, as the same action may hold different meanings depending on its surrounding context. To address this issue, we propose ActionPiece to explicitly incorporate context when tokenizing action sequences. In ActionPiece, each action is represented as a set of item features. Given the action sequence corpora, we construct the vocabulary by merging feature patterns as new tokens, based on their co-occurrence frequency both within individual sets and across adjacent sets. Considering the unordered nature of feature sets, we further introduce set permutation regularization, which produces multiple segmentations of action sequences with the same semantics. Our code is available at: https://github.com/google-deepmind/action_piece.

Abstract: The prediction of the Remaining Useful Life of aircraft engines is a critical area in high-reliability sectors such as aerospace and defense. Early failure predictions help ensure operational continuity, reduce maintenance costs, and prevent unexpected failures. Traditional regression models struggle with censored data, which can lead to biased predictions. Survival models, on the other hand, effectively handle censored data, improving predictive accuracy in maintenance processes. This paper introduces a novel approach based on the Rashomon perspective, which considers multiple models that achieve similar performance rather than relying on a single best model. This enables uncertainty quantification in survival probability predictions and enhances decision-making in predictive maintenance. The Rashomon survival curve was introduced to represent the range of survival probability estimates, providing insights into model agreement and uncertainty over time. The results on the CMAPSS dataset demonstrate that relying solely on a single model for RUL estimation may increase risk in some scenarios. The censoring levels significantly impact prediction uncertainty, with longer censoring times leading to greater variability in survival probabilities. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating model multiplicity in predictive maintenance frameworks to achieve more reliable and robust failure predictions. This paper contributes to uncertainty quantification in RUL prediction and highlights the Rashomon perspective as a powerful tool for predictive modeling.

<title>Does Prior Data Matter? Exploring Joint Training in the Context of Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning</title>

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to adapt to continuously emerging new classes while preserving knowledge of previously learned ones. Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) presents a greater challenge that requires the model to learn new classes from only a limited number of samples per class. While incremental learning typically assumes restricted access to past data, it often remains available in many real-world scenarios. This raises a practical question: should one retrain the model on the full dataset (i.e., joint training), or continue updating it solely with new data? In CIL, joint training is considered an ideal benchmark that provides a reference for evaluating the trade-offs between performance and computational cost. However, in FSCIL, joint training becomes less reliable due to severe imbalance between base and incremental classes. This results in the absence of a practical baseline, making it unclear which strategy is preferable for practitioners. To this end, we revisit joint training in the context of FSCIL by incorporating imbalance mitigation techniques, and suggest a new imbalance-aware joint training benchmark for FSCIL. We then conduct extensive comparisons between this benchmark and FSCIL methods to analyze which approach is most suitable when prior data is accessible. Our analysis offers realistic insights and guidance for selecting training strategies in real-world FSCIL scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/shiwonkim/Joint_FSCIL

Abstract: Improving the energy efficiency of building heating systems is crucial for reducing global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Traditional control methods rely on static heating curves that are based solely on outdoor temperature, neglecting system state measurements, such as indoor temperature, and free heat sources, such as solar gain. A more effective strategy is model predictive control (MPC), which optimizes heating control by incorporating system state predictions based on weather forecasts, among other factors. However, current industrial MPC solutions often employ simplified physics-inspired indoor temperature models, sacrificing accuracy for robustness and interpretability. To bridge this gap, we propose a partially stochastic deep learning (DL) architecture for building-specific indoor temperature modeling. Unlike most studies that evaluate model performance through simulations or limited test buildings, our experiments across a large dataset of 100 real-world buildings, covering various heating season conditions, demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms a widely used industrial physics-based model in predictive accuracy. The proposed DL architecture shows significant potential to improve thermal comfort and energy efficiency in heating MPC solutions. Although its computational cost is higher than that of the reference model, we discuss why this trade-off is manageable, even in large-scale applications. Unlike deterministic black-box approaches, the partially stochastic DL model offers a critical advantage by enabling pre-assessment of model feasibility through predictive uncertainty quantification. This work advances heating MPC, particularly for buildings with comprehensive datasets on their thermal behavior under various weather conditions.

Abstract: Training large, general-purpose language models poses significant challenges. The growing availability of specialized expert models, fine-tuned from pretrained models for specific tasks or domains, offers a promising alternative. Leveraging the potential of these existing expert models in real-world applications requires effective methods to select or merge the models best suited for a given task. This paper introduces SPECTR, an approach for dynamically composing expert models at each time step during inference. Notably, our method requires no additional training and enables flexible, token- and layer-wise model combinations. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPECTR improves routing accuracy over alternative training-free methods, increasing task performance across expert domains.

<title>Fast Controlled Generation from Language Models with Adaptive Weighted Rejection Sampling</title>

Abstract: The dominant approach to generating from language models subject to some constraint is locally constrained decoding (LCD), incrementally sampling tokens at each time step such that the constraint is never violated. Typically, this is achieved through token masking: looping over the vocabulary and excluding non-conforming tokens. There are two important problems with this approach. (i) Evaluating the constraint on every token can be prohibitively expensive -- LM vocabularies often exceed $100,000$ tokens. (ii) LCD can distort the global distribution over strings, sampling tokens based only on local information, even if they lead down dead-end paths. This work introduces a new algorithm that addresses both these problems. First, to avoid evaluating a constraint on the full vocabulary at each step of generation, we propose an adaptive rejection sampling algorithm that typically requires orders of magnitude fewer constraint evaluations. Second, we show how this algorithm can be extended to produce low-variance, unbiased estimates of importance weights at a very small additional cost -- estimates that can be soundly used within previously proposed sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to correct for the myopic behavior of local constraint enforcement. Through extensive empirical evaluation in text-to-SQL, molecular synthesis, goal inference, pattern matching, and JSON domains, we show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines, supporting a broader class of constraints and improving both runtime and performance. Additional theoretical and empirical analyses show that our method's runtime efficiency is driven by its dynamic use of computation, scaling with the divergence between the unconstrained and constrained LM, and as a consequence, runtime improvements are greater for better models.

<title>Can LLMs Handle WebShell Detection? Overcoming Detection Challenges with Behavioral Function-Aware Framework</title>

Abstract: WebShell attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into web servers, pose a significant cybersecurity threat. Traditional ML and DL methods are often hampered by challenges such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language Models have emerged as powerful alternatives for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that, stemming from their distinct analytical strategies, larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all baseline models lag behind previous SOTA methods. With the application of BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improves significantly, yielding an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Notably, larger models now outperform SOTA benchmarks, while smaller models such as Qwen-2.5-Coder-3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell detection and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic transition of motifs in temporal graphs is essential for revealing how graph structures evolve over time, identifying critical patterns, and predicting future behaviors, yet existing methods often focus on predefined motifs, limiting their ability to comprehensively capture transitions and interrelationships. We propose a parallel motif transition process discovery algorithm, PTMT, a novel parallel method for discovering motif transition processes in large-scale temporal graphs. PTMT integrates a tree-based framework with the temporal zone partitioning (TZP) strategy, which partitions temporal graphs by time and structure while preserving lossless motif transitions and enabling massive parallelism. PTMT comprises three phases: growth zone parallel expansion, overlap-aware result aggregation, and deterministic encoding of motif transitions, ensuring accurate tracking of dynamic transitions and interactions. Results on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTMT achieves speedups ranging from 12.0$\times$ to 50.3$\times$ compared to the SOTA method.

<title>High-Fidelity And Complex Test Data Generation For Real-World SQL Code Generation Services</title>

arXiv:2504.17203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand for high-fidelity test data is paramount in industrial settings where access to production data is largely restricted. Traditional data generation methods often fall short, struggling with low-fidelity and the ability to model complex data structures and semantic relationships that are critical for testing complex SQL code generation services like Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL). In this paper, we address the critical need for generating syntactically correct and semantically ``meaningful'' mock data for complex schema that includes columns with nested structures that we frequently encounter in Google SQL code generation workloads. We highlight the limitations of existing approaches used in production, particularly their inability to handle large and complex schema, as well as the lack of semantically coherent test data that lead to limited test coverage. We demonstrate that by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporating strategic pre- and post-processing steps, we can generate realistic high-fidelity test data that adheres to complex structural constraints and maintains semantic integrity to the test targets (SQL queries/functions). This approach supports comprehensive testing of complex SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, and even deeply nested subqueries, ensuring robust evaluation of SQL code generation services, like NL2SQL and SQL Code Assistant services. Our results demonstrate the practical utility of an out-of-the-box LLM (\textit{gemini}) based test data generation for industrial SQL code generation services where generating realistic test data is essential due to the frequent unavailability of production datasets.

<title>Balancing Interpretability and Flexibility in Modeling Diagnostic Trajectories with an Embedded Neural Hawkes Process Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21795</link>

arXiv:2504.21795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hawkes process (HP) is commonly used to model event sequences with self-reinforcing dynamics, including electronic health records (EHRs). Traditional HPs capture self-reinforcement via parametric impact functions that can be inspected to understand how each event modulates the intensity of others. Neural network-based HPs offer greater flexibility, resulting in improved fit and prediction performance, but at the cost of interpretability, which is often critical in healthcare. In this work, we aim to understand and improve upon this tradeoff. We propose a novel HP formulation in which impact functions are modeled by defining a flexible impact kernel, instantiated as a neural network, in event embedding space, which allows us to model large-scale event sequences with many event types. This approach is more flexible than traditional HPs yet more interpretable than other neural network approaches, and allows us to explicitly trade flexibility for interpretability by adding transformer encoder layers to further contextualize the event embeddings. Results show that our method accurately recovers impact functions in simulations, achieves competitive performance on MIMIC-IV procedure dataset, and gains clinically meaningful interpretation on Duke-EHR with children diagnosis dataset even without transformer layers. This suggests that our flexible impact kernel is often sufficient to capture self-reinforcing dynamics in EHRs and other data effectively, implying that interpretability can be maintained without loss of performance.

<title>RIFT: Closed-Loop RL Fine-Tuning for Realistic and Controllable Traffic Simulation</title>

arXiv:2505.03344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving both realism and controllability in closed-loop traffic simulation remains a key challenge in autonomous driving. Dataset-based methods reproduce realistic trajectories but suffer from covariate shift in closed-loop deployment, compounded by simplified dynamics models that further reduce reliability. Conversely, physics-based simulation methods enhance reliable and controllable closed-loop interactions but often lack expert demonstrations, compromising realism. To address these challenges, we introduce a dual-stage AV-centric simulation framework that conducts open-loop imitation learning pre-training in a data-driven simulator to capture trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability, followed by closed-loop reinforcement learning fine-tuning in a physics-based simulator to enhance style-level controllability and mitigate covariate shift. In the fine-tuning stage, we propose RIFT, a novel RL fine-tuning strategy that evaluates all candidate modalities through group-relative optimization with a dual-clip surrogate objective, enhancing style-level controllability and mitigating covariate shift, while preserving the trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability inherited from IL pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFT improves realism and controllability in traffic simulation while simultaneously exposing the limitations of modern AV systems in closed-loop evaluation.

Abstract: Learning bimanual manipulation is challenging due to its high dimensionality and tight coordination required between two arms. Eye-in-hand imitation learning, which uses wrist-mounted cameras, simplifies perception by focusing on task-relevant views. However, collecting diverse demonstrations remains costly, motivating the need for scalable data augmentation. While prior work has explored visual augmentation in single-arm settings, extending these approaches to bimanual manipulation requires generating viewpoint-consistent observations across both arms and producing corresponding action labels that are both valid and feasible. In this work, we propose Diffusion for COordinated Dual-arm Data Augmentation (D-CODA), a method for offline data augmentation tailored to eye-in-hand bimanual imitation learning that trains a diffusion model to synthesize novel, viewpoint-consistent wrist-camera images for both arms while simultaneously generating joint-space action labels. It employs constrained optimization to ensure that augmented states involving gripper-to-object contacts adhere to constraints suitable for bimanual coordination. We evaluate D-CODA on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2250 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that it outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable data augmentation in eye-in-hand bimanual manipulation.

Abstract: The human body demonstrates exceptional motor capabilities-such as standing steadily on one foot or performing a high kick with the leg raised over 1.5 meters-both requiring precise balance control. While recent research on humanoid control has leveraged reinforcement learning to track human motions for skill acquisition, applying this paradigm to balance-intensive tasks remains challenging. In this work, we identify three key obstacles: instability from reference motion errors, learning difficulties due to morphological mismatch, and the sim-to-real gap caused by sensor noise and unmodeled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose HuB (Humanoid Balance), a unified framework that integrates reference motion refinement, balance-aware policy learning, and sim-to-real robustness training, with each component targeting a specific challenge. We validate our approach on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot across challenging quasi-static balance tasks, including extreme single-legged poses such as Swallow Balance and Bruce Lee's Kick. Our policy remains stable even under strong physical disturbances-such as a forceful soccer strike-while baseline methods consistently fail to complete these tasks.

Abstract: Real robots are expected to repeat the same behavior in new environments with very little new data, yet modern controllers either incur heavy per-step inference or require deployment-time fine-tuning. We propose RT-Cache, a training-free retrieval-as-control pipeline that caches diverse image action trajectories in a unified vector memory and, at test time, embeds the current frame to retrieve and replay multi-step snippets, replacing per-step model calls. A hierarchical search keeps lookups sub-second at million scale, shifting cost from compute to storage and enabling real-time control on modest GPUs. Across real-robot tasks and large open logs, RT-Cache achieves higher success and lower completion time than strong retrieval baselines (approximately x2 higher success and ~30% faster in our settings), and a single-episode anchoring study shows immediate adaptation to a more complex, contact-rich task without fine-tuning. RT-Cache turns experience into an append-only memory, offering a simple, scalable path to few-shot deployment today and a foundation for multimodal keys and optional integration with high-level policies.

Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is a key component of smart devices, enabling efficient and intuitive audio interaction. However, standard KWS systems deployed on embedded devices often suffer performance degradation under real-world operating conditions. Resilient KWS systems address this issue by enabling dynamic adaptation, with applications such as adding or replacing keywords, adjusting to specific users, and improving noise robustness. However, deploying resilient, standalone KWS systems with low latency on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to limited memory and computational resources. This study proposes a low computational approach for continuous noise adaptation of pretrained neural networks used for KWS classification, requiring only 1-shot learning and one epoch. The proposed method was assessed using two pretrained models and three real-world noise sources at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) ranging from 24 to -3 dB. The adapted models consistently outperformed the pretrained models across all scenarios, especially at SNR $\leq$ 18 dB, achieving accuracy improvements of 4.9% to 46.0%. These results highlight the efficacy of the proposed methodology while being lightweight enough for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and robustness of autonomous driving systems necessitates a comprehensive evaluation in safety-critical scenarios. However, these safety-critical scenarios are rare and difficult to collect from real-world driving data, posing significant challenges to effectively assessing the performance of autonomous vehicles. Typical existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and lack user-friendliness, as extensive expert knowledge is essentially required. To address these challenges, we propose LD-Scene, a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for user-controllable adversarial scenario generation through natural language. Our approach comprises an LDM that captures realistic driving trajectory distributions and an LLM-based guidance module that translates user queries into adversarial loss functions, facilitating the generation of scenarios aligned with user queries. The guidance module integrates an LLM-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) code generator and an LLM-based code debugger, enhancing the controllability and robustness in generating guidance functions. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that LD-Scene achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, diverse, and effective adversarial scenarios. Furthermore, our framework provides fine-grained control over adversarial behaviors, thereby facilitating more effective testing tailored to specific driving scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents JARVIS, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and domain expertise to generate high-quality scripts for specialized Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tasks. By combining a domain-specific LLM trained with synthetically generated data, a custom compiler for structural verification, rule enforcement, code fixing capabilities, and advanced retrieval mechanisms, our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art domain-specific models. Our framework addresses the challenges of data scarcity and hallucination errors in LLMs, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in specialized engineering domains. We evaluate our framework on multiple benchmarks and show that it outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy and reliability. Our work sets a new precedent for the application of LLMs in EDA and paves the way for future innovations in this field.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning these models with human preferences and values is critical to ensuring ethical and safe applications. However, existing alignment techniques such as RLHF or DPO often require direct fine-tuning on LLMs with billions of parameters, resulting in substantial computational costs and inefficiencies. To address this, we propose Micro token-level Accept-Reject Aligning (MARA) approach designed to operate independently of the language models. MARA simplifies the alignment process by decomposing sentence-level preference learning into token-level binary classification, where a compact three-layer fully-connected network determines whether candidate tokens are "Accepted" or "Rejected" as part of the response. Extensive experiments across seven different LLMs and three open-source datasets show that MARA achieves significant improvements in alignment performance while reducing computational costs. The source code and implementation details are publicly available at https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/MARA, and the trained models are released at https://huggingface.co/IAAR-Shanghai/MARA_AGENTS.

Abstract: Extragalactic foregrounds in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations are both a source of cosmological and astrophysical information and a nuisance to the CMB. Effective field-level modeling that captures their non-Gaussian statistical distributions is increasingly important for optimal information extraction, particularly given the precise and low-noise observations from current and upcoming experiments. We explore the use of Wavelet Flow (WF) models to tackle the novel task of modeling the field-level probability distributions of multi-component CMB secondaries and foreground. Specifically, we jointly train correlated CMB lensing convergence ($\kappa$) and cosmic infrared background (CIB) maps with a WF model and obtain a network that statistically recovers the input to high accuracy -- the trained network generates samples of $\kappa$ and CIB fields whose average power spectra are within a few percent of the inputs across all scales, and whose Minkowski functionals are similarly accurate compared to the inputs. Leveraging the multiscale architecture of these models, we fine-tune both the model parameters and the priors at each scale independently, optimizing performance across different resolutions. These results demonstrate that WF models can accurately simulate correlated components of CMB secondaries, supporting improved analysis of cosmological data. Our code and trained models can be found here (https://github.com/matiwosm/HybridPriorWavletFlow.git).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, LLaMA, and Claude achieve remarkable performance in text generation but remain opaque in their decision-making processes, limiting trust and accountability in high-stakes applications. We present gSMILE (generative SMILE), a model-agnostic, perturbation-based framework for token-level interpretability in LLMs. Extending the SMILE methodology, gSMILE uses controlled prompt perturbations, Wasserstein distance metrics, and weighted linear surrogates to identify input tokens with the most significant impact on the output. This process enables the generation of intuitive heatmaps that visually highlight influential tokens and reasoning paths. We evaluate gSMILE across leading LLMs (OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct, Meta's LLaMA 3.1 Instruct Turbo, and Anthropic's Claude 2.1) using attribution fidelity, attribution consistency, attribution stability, attribution faithfulness, and attribution accuracy as metrics. Results show that gSMILE delivers reliable human-aligned attributions, with Claude 2.1 excelling in attention fidelity and GPT-3.5 achieving the highest output consistency. These findings demonstrate gSMILE's ability to balance model performance and interpretability, enabling more transparent and trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Humans excel at analogical reasoning - applying knowledge from one task to a related one with minimal relearning. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically require extensive retraining even when new tasks share structural similarities with previously learned ones. In this work, we propose MAGIK, a novel framework that enables RL agents to transfer knowledge to analogous tasks without interacting with the target environment. Our approach leverages an imagination mechanism to map entities in the target task to their analogues in the source domain, allowing the agent to reuse its original policy. Experiments on custom MiniGrid and MuJoCo tasks show that MAGIK achieves effective zero-shot transfer using only a small number of human-labelled examples. We compare our approach to related baselines and highlight how it offers a novel and effective mechanism for knowledge transfer via imagination-based analogy mapping.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) offer a powerful framework for sampling graphs in proportion to their rewards. However, existing approaches suffer from systematic biases due to inaccuracies in state transition probability computations. These biases, rooted in the inherent symmetries of graphs, impact both atom-based and fragment-based generation schemes. To address this challenge, we introduce Symmetry-Aware GFlowNets (SA-GFN), a method that incorporates symmetry corrections into the learning process through reward scaling. By integrating bias correction directly into the reward structure, SA-GFN eliminates the need for explicit state transition computations. Empirical results show that SA-GFN enables unbiased sampling while enhancing diversity and consistently generating high-reward graphs that closely match the target distribution.

Abstract: Building capable household and industrial robots requires mastering the control of versatile, high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems such as mobile manipulators. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for autonomously acquiring robot control policies, scaling it to high-DoF embodiments remains challenging. Direct RL in the real world demands both safe exploration and high sample efficiency, which are difficult to achieve in practice. Sim-to-real RL, on the other hand, is often brittle due to the reality gap. This paper introduces SLAC, a method that renders real-world RL feasible for complex embodiments by leveraging a low-fidelity simulator to pretrain a task-agnostic latent action space. SLAC trains this latent action space via a customized unsupervised skill discovery method designed to promote temporal abstraction, disentanglement, and safety, thereby facilitating efficient downstream learning. Once a latent action space is learned, SLAC uses it as the action interface for a novel off-policy RL algorithm to autonomously learn downstream tasks through real-world interactions. We evaluate SLAC against existing methods on a suite of bimanual mobile manipulation tasks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLAC learns contact-rich whole-body tasks in under an hour of real-world interactions, without relying on any demonstrations or hand-crafted behavior priors.

Abstract: Recent attempts at source tracing for codec-based deepfake speech (CodecFake), generated by neural audio codec-based speech generation (CoSG) models, have exhibited suboptimal performance. However, how to train source tracing models using simulated CoSG data while maintaining strong performance on real CoSG-generated audio remains an open challenge. In this paper, we show that models trained solely on codec-resynthesized data tend to overfit to non-speech regions and struggle to generalize to unseen content. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce the Semantic-Acoustic Source Tracing Network (SASTNet), which jointly leverages Whisper for semantic feature encoding and Wav2vec2 with AudioMAE for acoustic feature encoding. Our proposed SASTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoSG test set of the CodecFake+ dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness for reliable source tracing.

Abstract: Computing classical centrality measures such as betweenness and closeness is computationally expensive on large-scale graphs. In this work, we introduce an efficient force layout algorithm that embeds a graph into a low-dimensional space, where the radial distance from the origin serves as a proxy for various centrality measures. We evaluate our method on multiple graph families and demonstrate strong correlations with degree, PageRank, and paths-based centralities. As an application, it turns out that the proposed embedding allows to find high-influence nodes in a network, and provides a fast and scalable alternative to the standard greedy algorithm.

<title>Generative Modeling of Full-Atom Protein Conformations using Latent Diffusion on Graph Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.

<title>OrthoRank: Token Selection via Sink Token Orthogonality for Efficient LLM inference</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03865</link>

arXiv:2507.03865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms are central to the success of large language models (LLMs), enabling them to capture intricate token dependencies and implicitly assign importance to each token. Recent studies have revealed the sink token, which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper, the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput, while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.

Abstract: The proliferation of fine-tuned language model experts for specific tasks and domains signals the need for efficient selection and combination methods. We propose LoRA-Augmented Generation (LAG) for leveraging large libraries of knowledge and task-specific LoRA adapters. LAG requires no additional training or access to data, and efficiently filters, retrieves, and applies experts on a per-token and layer basis. We evaluate LAG on various knowledge-intensive tasks, achieving superior performance over existing data-free methods. We explore scenarios where additional data is available, demonstrating LAG's compatibility with alternative solutions such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

<title>Information Must Flow: Recursive Bootstrapping for Information Bottleneck in Optimal Transport</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10443</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.10443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), a unified framework that models cognition as the directed flow of information between high-entropy context and low-entropy content. Inference emerges as a cycle of bidirectional interactions, bottom-up contextual disambiguation paired with top-down content reconstruction, which resolves the Information Bottleneck in Optimal Transport (iBOT). Implemented via Rao-Blackwellized variational entropy minimization, CCUP steers representations toward minimal joint uncertainty while preserving inferential directionality. Local cycle completion underpins temporal bootstrapping, chaining simulations to refine memory, and spatial bootstrapping, enabling compositional hierarchical inference. We prove a Delta Convergence Theorem showing that recursive entropy minimization yields delta-like attractors in latent space, stabilizing perceptual schemas and motor plans. Temporal bootstrapping through perception-action loops and sleep-wake consolidation further transforms episodic traces into semantic knowledge. Extending CCUP, each hierarchical level performs delta-seeded inference: low-entropy content seeds diffuse outward along goal-constrained paths shaped by top-down priors and external context, confining inference to task-relevant manifolds and circumventing the curse of dimensionality. Building on this, we propose that language emerges as a symbolic transport system, externalizing latent content to synchronize inference cycles across individuals. Together, these results establish iBOT as a foundational principle of information flow in both individual cognition and collective intelligence, positioning recursive inference as the structured conduit through which minds adapt, align, and extend.

arXiv:2507.13543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function $h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.

arXiv:2507.21412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a trained machine learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific query instances were included in the dataset. We classify existing MIAs into adaptive or non-adaptive, depending on whether the adversary is allowed to train shadow models on membership queries. In the adaptive setting, where the adversary can train shadow models after accessing query instances, we highlight the importance of exploiting membership dependencies between instances and propose an attack-agnostic framework called Cascading Membership Inference Attack (CMIA), which incorporates membership dependencies via conditional shadow training to boost membership inference performance.
  In the non-adaptive setting, where the adversary is restricted to training shadow models before obtaining membership queries, we introduce Proxy Membership Inference Attack (PMIA). PMIA employs a proxy selection strategy that identifies samples with similar behaviors to the query instance and uses their behaviors in shadow models to perform a membership posterior odds test for membership inference. We provide theoretical analyses for both attacks, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that CMIA and PMIA substantially outperform existing MIAs in both settings, particularly in the low false-positive regime, which is crucial for evaluating privacy risks.

arXiv:2508.04711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale recommendation systems are pivotal to process an immense volume of daily user interactions, requiring the effective modeling of high cardinality and heterogeneous features to ensure accurate predictions. In prior work, we introduced Hierarchical Sequential Transducers (HSTU), an attention-based architecture for modeling high cardinality, non-stationary streaming recommendation data, providing good scaling law in the generative recommender framework (GR). Recent studies and experiments demonstrate that attending to longer user history sequences yields significant metric improvements. However, scaling sequence length is activation-heavy, necessitating parallelism solutions to effectively shard activation memory. In transformer-based LLMs, context parallelism (CP) is a commonly used technique that distributes computation along the sequence-length dimension across multiple GPUs, effectively reducing memory usage from attention activations. In contrast, production ranking models typically utilize jagged input tensors to represent user interaction features, introducing unique CP implementation challenges. In this work, we introduce context parallelism with jagged tensor support for HSTU attention, establishing foundational capabilities for scaling up sequence dimensions. Our approach enables a 5.3x increase in supported user interaction sequence length, while achieving a 1.55x scaling factor when combined with Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP).

Abstract: We explore machine learning techniques for predicting Curie temperatures of magnetic materials using the NEMAD database. By augmenting the dataset with composition-based and domain-aware descriptors, we evaluate the performance of several machine learning models. We find that the Extra Trees Regressor delivers the best performance reaching an R^2 score of up to 0.85 $\pm$ 0.01 (cross-validated) for a balanced dataset. We employ the k-means clustering algorithm to gain insights into the performance of chemically distinct material groups. Furthermore, we perform the SHAP analysis to identify key physicochemical drivers of Curie behavior, such as average atomic number and magnetic moment. By employing explainable AI techniques, this analysis offers insights into the model's predictive behavior, thereby advancing scientific interpretability.

Abstract: Voice anonymization protects speaker privacy by concealing identity while preserving linguistic and paralinguistic content. Self-supervised learning (SSL) representations encode linguistic features but preserve speaker traits. We propose a novel speaker-embedding-free framework called SEF-MK. Instead of using a single k-means model trained on the entire dataset, SEF-MK anonymizes SSL representations for each utterance by randomly selecting one of multiple k-means models, each trained on a different subset of speakers. We explore this approach from both attacker and user perspectives. Extensive experiments show that, compared to a single k-means model, SEF-MK with multiple k-means models better preserves linguistic and emotional content from the user's viewpoint. However, from the attacker's perspective, utilizing multiple k-means models boosts the effectiveness of privacy attacks. These insights can aid users in designing voice anonymization systems to mitigate attacker threats.

<title>AugLift: Boosting Generalization in Lifting-based 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07112</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lifting-based methods for 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which predict 3D poses from detected 2D keypoints, often generalize poorly to new datasets and real-world settings. To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly improves generalization performance without requiring additional data collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models (e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures.
  Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$, while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: As the particle physics community needs higher and higher precisions in order to test our current model of the subatomic world, larger and larger datasets are necessary. With upgrades scheduled for the detectors of colliding-beam experiments around the world, and specifically at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, more collisions and more complex interactions are expected. This directly implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering, known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies as high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine learning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates. In this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for charged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The pipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely on GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms currently in production at LHCb. The pipeline was also accelerated on the FPGA architecture, and its performance in terms of power consumption and processing speed was compared against the GPU implementation.

Summary:
DSperse is a modular framework for distributed machine learning inference that incorporates strategic cryptographic verification. It operates within the realm of distributed zero-knowledge machine learning, offering targeted verification of specific subcomputations known as "slices". These slices can cover various parts of the inference pipeline, with global consistency enforced through audit, replication, or economic incentives. The architecture of DSperse supports a form of trust minimization by localizing zero-knowledge proofs to components where they are most beneficial. The framework was evaluated using multiple proving systems, with emphasis on memory usage, runtime, and circuit behavior in both sliced and unsliced configurations. By allowing proof boundaries to align with the logical structure of the model, DSperse facilitates scalable and targeted verification strategies to address diverse deployment needs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: DSperse is a modular framework for distributed machine learning inference with strategic cryptographic verification. Operating within the emerging paradigm of distributed zero-knowledge machine learning, DSperse avoids the high cost and rigidity of full-model circuitization by enabling targeted verification of strategically chosen subcomputations. These verifiable segments, or "slices", may cover part or all of the inference pipeline, with global consistency enforced through audit, replication, or economic incentives. This architecture supports a pragmatic form of trust minimization, localizing zero-knowledge proofs to the components where they provide the greatest value. We evaluate DSperse using multiple proving systems and report empirical results on memory usage, runtime, and circuit behavior under sliced and unsliced configurations. By allowing proof boundaries to align flexibly with the model's logical structure, DSperse supports scalable, targeted verification strategies suited to diverse deployment needs.

Abstract: Since the Fourth Industrial Revolution, AI technology has been widely used in many fields, but there are several limitations that need to be overcome, including overfitting/underfitting, class imbalance, and the limitations of representation (hypothesis space) due to the characteristics of different models. As a method to overcome these problems, ensemble, commonly known as model combining, is being extensively used in the field of machine learning. Among ensemble learning methods, voting ensembles have been studied with various weighting methods, showing performance improvements. However, the existing methods that reflect the pre-information of classifiers in weights consider only one evaluation criterion, which limits the reflection of various information that should be considered in a model realistically. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of making decisions considering various information through cooperative games in multi-criteria situations. Using this method, various types of information known beforehand in classifiers can be simultaneously considered and reflected, leading to appropriate weight distribution and performance improvement. The machine learning algorithms were applied to the Open-ML-CC18 dataset and compared with existing ensemble weighting methods. The experimental results showed superior performance compared to other weighting methods.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable reasoning capabilities across domains like code, math and other enterprise tasks, their significant memory and computational costs often preclude their use in practical enterprise settings. To this end, we introduce Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter model in the ServiceNow Apriel SLM series that achieves performance against medium sized state-of-the-art models such as o1-mini, QWQ32B, and EXAONE-Deep-32B while maintaining only half the memory footprint of those alternatives. Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker model is trained in a four stage training pipeline including 1) Base Model upscaling, 2) Continual Pre-training 3) Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and 4) Reinforcement Learning using GRPO. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite of benchmarks consistently demonstrate that our Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker model matches or exceeds the performance of its 32-billion parameter counterparts, despite being less than half their size.

Summary: 
This research paper introduces a prompt-based continual learning (PCL) approach for medical AI models, addressing data sharing constraints in the medical domain. With a unified prompt pool and minimal expansion strategy, the proposed method reduces computational overhead while balancing retention and adaptation. Experimental results on diabetic retinopathy datasets show that the model improves final classification accuracy and F1-score significantly compared to existing methods, while also lowering inference cost. The study aims to drive sustainable advancements in medical AI, facilitating real-time diagnosis, patient monitoring, and telemedicine applications in distributed healthcare settings.

Abstract: Modern AI models achieve state-of-the-art performance with large-scale, high-quality datasets; however, ethical, social, and institutional constraints in the medical domain severely restrict data sharing, rendering centralized learning nearly impossible. Each institution must incrementally update models using only local data. Traditional training overfits new samples and suffers from catastrophic forgetting, losing previously acquired knowledge. Medical data distributions also shift due to varying diagnostic equipment and demographics. Although continual learning (CL) has advanced, most methods address natural images, leaving medical-domain-specific CL underexplored. We propose a prompt-based continual learning (PCL) approach featuring a unified prompt pool with a minimal expansion strategy: by expanding and freezing a subset of prompts, our method reduces computational overhead, and a novel regularization term balances retention and adaptation. Experiments on three diabetic retinopathy datasets Aptos2019, LI2019, and Diabetic Retinopathy Detection show our model improves final classification accuracy by at least 10% and F1-score by 9 points over state-of-the-art approaches while lowering inference cost. We anticipate this study will drive sustainable medical AI advances, enabling real-time diagnosis, patient monitoring, and telemedicine applications in distributed healthcare.

Summary: 
Retro-Expert is a new interpretable retrosynthesis framework that combines the reasoning strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialized models through reinforcement learning. It offers natural language explanations rooted in chemical logic by using specialized models for shallow reasoning, LLM-driven critical reasoning for predictions and reasoning paths, and reinforcement learning for optimizing decision policy. In experiments, Retro-Expert outperforms LLM-based and specialized models, providing expert-aligned explanations that enhance understanding and bridge the gap between AI predictions and practical chemical insights. <div>

Abstract: Retrosynthesis prediction aims to infer the reactant molecule based on a given product molecule, which is a fundamental task in chemical synthesis. However, existing models rely on static pattern-matching paradigm, which limits their ability to perform effective logic decision-making, leading to black-box decision-making. Building on this, we propose Retro-Expert, an interpretable retrosynthesis framework that performs collaborative reasoning by combining the complementary reasoning strengths of Large Language Models and specialized models via reinforcement learning. It outputs natural language explanations grounded in chemical logic through three components: (1) specialized models perform shallow reasoning to construct high-quality chemical decision space, (2) LLM-driven critical reasoning to generate predictions and corresponding interpretable reasoning path, and (3) reinforcement learning optimizing interpretable decision policy. Experiments show that Retro-Expert not only surpasses both LLM-based and specialized models across different metrics but also provides expert-aligned explanations that bridge the gap between AI predictions and actionable chemical insights.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have shown that simply scaling data quantity eventually leads to diminishing returns, hitting a data wall. In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged as a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this, the factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that produces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly extends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and Nemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1 percentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of 14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web data and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for 180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token budget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on synthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to rephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality. Overall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating high-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly optimizing many factors, a challenging task that requires rigorous science and practical expertise. Naive approaches can yield modest improvements, potentially at great cost, while well-executed methods can yield transformative improvements, as exemplified by BeyondWeb.

<div> Keywords: Text-to-image models, model selection, fine-tuning, pretrained models, performance indication

Summary:
The paper introduces a model selection framework, M&amp;C, for efficiently choosing a pretrained Text-to-image (T2I) model from a model platform for fine-tuning on a target dataset. M&amp;C utilizes a matching graph that includes nodes representing available models and datasets, with edges capturing performance and data similarity. By considering model/data features and graph embeddings, M&amp;C predicts the best model for fine-tuning on the target domain. Evaluation on ten T2I models and 32 datasets shows that M&amp;C successfully predicts the best model in 61.3% of cases. This framework addresses the challenge of selecting the most suitable pretrained T2I model for specific target data domains, helping users streamline the process of building AI applications for generating media contents. The results highlight the effectiveness of M&amp;C in guiding model selection for optimal performance in T2I tasks.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models based on diffusion and transformer architectures advance rapidly. They are often pretrained on large corpora, and openly shared on a model platform, such as HuggingFace. Users can then build up AI applications, e.g., generating media contents, by adopting pretrained T2I models and fine-tuning them on the target dataset. While public pretrained T2I models facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new challenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain? Model selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known in (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target domain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&amp;C, which enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model platform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The core of M&amp;C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available models and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs capturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We then build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and, critically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph, predicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target domain. We evaluate M&amp;C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets against three baselines. Our results show that M&amp;C successfully predicts the best model for fine-tuning in 61.3% of the cases and a closely performing model for the rest.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models, Entropy, Exploration, Exploitation

Summary:
CURE (Critical-token-gUided Re concatenation for Entropy-collapse prevention) is introduced to address the issue of low diversity model behavior in Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR). The framework balances exploration and exploitation through a two-stage process. In the first stage, critical tokens are regenerated at high entropy to steer the model towards novel yet coherent contexts. This process results in better performance on math reasoning tasks while sustaining high-level entropy for exploration. In the second stage, training continues with static initial-state sampling to strengthen exploitation gradually. Experiments on Qwen-2.5-Math-7B demonstrate that CURE outperforms other RLVR methods, achieving a 5% performance gain across six math benchmarks. The framework establishes state-of-the-art performance in both entropy and accuracy. The effectiveness of CURE is further validated through a series of experiments. The code for CURE is available on GitHub at https://github.com/CURE-Project/CURE.

arXiv:2508.11016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) have driven the emergence of more sophisticated cognitive behaviors in large language models (LLMs), thereby enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, in prior RLVR pipelines, the repeated use of static initial-state sampling drawn exactly from the dataset distribution during each sampling phase produced overly deterministic, low diversity model behavior, which manifested as rapid entropy collapse and hindered sustained performance gains during prolonged training. To address this issue, we introduce CURE (Critical-token-gUided Re concatenation for Entropy-collapse prevention), a two-stage framework that balances exploration and exploitation. Specifically, in the first stage, to deliberately steer the model toward novel yet coherent contexts, we re-generate at high-entropy critical tokens and jointly optimize the original and the branched trajectories. The further comparison with vanilla DAPO shows that the regeneration process achieves a better performance on math reasoning tasks while sustaining a high-level entropy degree for exploration. In the second stage, we continue training with static initial-state sampling by DAPO, intentionally placing the model in a familiar state to gradually strengthen exploitation. Extensive experiments on Qwen-2.5-Math-7B show that, compared to other RLVR methods, CURE achieves a 5% performance gain across six math benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance in both entropy and accuracy. A series of experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is available at https://github.com/CURE-Project/CURE.

<div> quantization, neural networks, pruning, strong lottery ticket hypothesis, finite-precision

Summary:
Using insights from the Random Subset Sum Problem and Number Partitioning Problem, this work extends the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH) framework to finite-precision neural networks. The study demonstrates that in the quantized setting, certain target discrete neural networks can be represented exactly through pruning, with optimal bounds on necessary overparameterization. Previous theoretical work on the SLTH framework primarily focused on the continuous setting, but this research expands these findings to the quantized setting, providing valuable insights into the construction of efficient neural networks with limited precision. The results highlight the potential for achieving exact representations of target networks through pruning strategies, shedding light on the theoretical foundations of quantization in neural networks. <div>
arXiv:2508.11020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization is an essential technique for making neural networks more efficient, yet our theoretical understanding of it remains limited. Previous works demonstrated that extremely low-precision networks, such as binary networks, can be constructed by pruning large, randomly-initialized networks, and showed that the ratio between the size of the original and the pruned networks is at most polylogarithmic.
  The specific pruning method they employed inspired a line of theoretical work known as the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH), which leverages insights from the Random Subset Sum Problem. However, these results primarily address the continuous setting and cannot be applied to extend SLTH results to the quantized setting.
  In this work, we build on foundational results by Borgs et al. on the Number Partitioning Problem to derive new theoretical results for the Random Subset Sum Problem in a quantized setting.
  Using these results, we then extend the SLTH framework to finite-precision networks. While prior work on SLTH showed that pruning allows approximation of a certain class of neural networks, we demonstrate that, in the quantized setting, the analogous class of target discrete neural networks can be represented exactly, and we prove optimal bounds on the necessary overparameterization of the initial network as a function of the precision of the target network.

Summary:<br />
- Conformal prediction is an uncertainty quantification method that enhances base predictors with statistically valid prediction sets.
- Current methods are computationally expensive and data-intensive, requiring an uncertainty model before calibration.
- Zono-conformal prediction introduces zonotopes as prediction sets to capture dependencies in multi-dimensional outputs.
- It constructs zono-conformal predictors via a single, data-efficient linear program, particularly focusing on feed-forward neural networks.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a popular uncertainty quantification method that augments a base predictor with prediction sets with statistically valid coverage guarantees. However, current methods are often computationally expensive and data-intensive, as they require constructing an uncertainty model before calibration. Moreover, existing approaches typically represent the prediction sets with intervals, which limits their ability to capture dependencies in multi-dimensional outputs. We address these limitations by introducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval predictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs prediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty sets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors can be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program. While we can apply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we focus on feed-forward neural networks in this work. Aside from regression tasks, we also construct optimal zono-conformal predictors in classification settings where the output of an uncertain predictor is a set of possible classes. We provide probabilistic coverage guarantees and present methods for detecting outliers in the identification data. In extensive numerical experiments, we show that zono-conformal predictors are less conservative than interval predictor models and standard conformal prediction methods, while achieving a similar coverage over the test data.

<div> trust, belief, confidence, learning rates, probability

Summary:
The article explores the concept of confidence in learning and belief updating processes. It distinguishes confidence from probability or likelihood, highlighting its significance in understanding the impact of incoming information on the belief state. The notion of learner's confidence is formalized through axioms and can be measured on a continuum. Confidence encompasses familiar concepts such as learning rates, training epochs, Shafer's weight of evidence, and Kalman gain. It is shown that confidence can always be represented in certain ways and, under specific assumptions, more concise representations of confidence-based learning can be derived using vector fields and loss functions. These representations lead to an extended language involving compound "parallel" observations. The article also links Bayes Rule to an optimizing learner with a linear expectation loss representation. <div>

Abstract: We characterize a notion of confidence that arises in learning or updating beliefs: the amount of trust one has in incoming information and its impact on the belief state. This learner's confidence can be used alongside (and is easily mistaken for) probability or likelihood, but it is fundamentally a different concept -- one that captures many familiar concepts in the literature, including learning rates and number of training epochs, Shafer's weight of evidence, and Kalman gain. We formally axiomatize what it means to learn with confidence, give two canonical ways of measuring confidence on a continuum, and prove that confidence can always be represented in this way. Under additional assumptions, we derive more compact representations of confidence-based learning in terms of vector fields and loss functions. These representations induce an extended language of compound "parallel" observations. We characterize Bayes Rule as the special case of an optimizing learner whose loss representation is a linear expectation.

Summary: <br />
- The paper discusses how for general non-Gaussian distributions, the covariance and precision matrices do not convey the independence structure of variables like they do for the multivariate Gaussian distribution.
- It focuses on a class of non-Gaussian distributions derived from diagonal transformations of a Gaussian, known as the generalized nonparanormal, where conditional independence information can be inferred from the precision matrix under specific criteria.
- The transformations defining these distributions can be arbitrary in nature.

arXiv:2508.11050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For general non-Gaussian distributions, the covariance and precision matrices do not encode the independence structure of the variables, as they do for the multivariate Gaussian. This paper builds on previous work to show that for a class of non-Gaussian distributions -- those derived from diagonal transformations of a Gaussian -- information about the conditional independence structure can still be inferred from the precision matrix, provided the data meet certain criteria, analogous to the Gaussian case. We call such transformations of the Gaussian as the generalized nonparanormal. The functions that define these transformations are, in a broad sense, arbitrary. We also provide a simple and computationally efficient algorithm that leverages this theory to recover conditional independence structure from the generalized nonparanormal data. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated via synthetic experiments and applications to real-world data.

Abstract: Post hoc explanation methods, such as LIME and SHAP, provide interpretable insights into black-box classifiers and are increasingly used to assess model biases and generalizability. However, these methods are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, potentially concealing harmful biases. Building on the work of Slack et al. (2020), we investigate the susceptibility of LIME and SHAP to biased models and evaluate strategies for improving robustness. We first replicate the original COMPAS experiment to validate prior findings and establish a baseline. We then introduce a modular testing framework enabling systematic evaluation of augmented and ensemble explanation approaches across classifiers of varying performance. Using this framework, we assess multiple LIME/SHAP ensemble configurations on out-of-distribution models, comparing their resistance to bias concealment against the original methods. Our results identify configurations that substantially improve bias detection, highlighting their potential for enhancing transparency in the deployment of high-stakes machine learning systems.

Summary: <br />
The study focuses on creating sample-level embeddings for microbiome data that consider taxa abundance. Using an abundance-aware variant of the Set Transformer model, the researchers weighted sequence embeddings based on their relative abundance to construct fixed-size sample embeddings. This method, which replicates embedding vectors according to abundance and applies self-attention-based aggregation, outperformed traditional averaging and unweighted Set Transformers in microbiome classification tasks. The results showed perfect performance in some instances, highlighting the importance of incorporating abundance information for accurate and biologically meaningful microbiome representation. This approach, one of the first to integrate sequence-level abundance into Transformer-based embeddings, demonstrates the potential for robust and informative microbiome sample representation for various downstream tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.11075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbiome sample representation to input into LLMs is essential for downstream tasks such as phenotype prediction and environmental classification. While prior studies have explored embedding-based representations of each microbiome sample, most rely on simple averaging over sequence embeddings, often overlooking the biological importance of taxa abundance. In this work, we propose an abundance-aware variant of the Set Transformer to construct fixed-size sample-level embeddings by weighting sequence embeddings according to their relative abundance. Without modifying the model architecture, we replicate embedding vectors proportional to their abundance and apply self-attention-based aggregation. Our method outperforms average pooling and unweighted Set Transformers on real-world microbiome classification tasks, achieving perfect performance in some cases. These results demonstrate the utility of abundance-aware aggregation for robust and biologically informed microbiome representation. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first approaches to integrate sequence-level abundance into Transformer-based sample embeddings.

Abstract: Watch time is widely used as a proxy for user satisfaction in video recommendation platforms. However, raw watch times are influenced by confounding factors such as video duration, popularity, and individual user behaviors, potentially distorting preference signals and resulting in biased recommendation models. We propose a novel relative advantage debiasing framework that corrects watch time by comparing it to empirically derived reference distributions conditioned on user and item groups. This approach yields a quantile-based preference signal and introduces a two-stage architecture that explicitly separates distribution estimation from preference learning. Additionally, we present distributional embeddings to efficiently parameterize watch-time quantiles without requiring online sampling or storage of historical data. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to existing baseline methods.

arXiv:2508.11090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion in the size of new datasets has created a need for fast and efficient parameter-learning techniques. Compressive learning is a framework that enables efficient processing by using random, non-linear features to project large-scale databases onto compact, information-preserving representations whose dimensionality is independent of the number of samples and can be easily stored, transferred, and processed. These database-level summaries are then used to decode parameters of interest from the underlying data distribution without requiring access to the original samples, offering an efficient and privacy-friendly learning framework. However, both the encoding and decoding techniques are typically randomized and data-independent, failing to exploit the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose a framework that meta-learns both the encoding and decoding stages of compressive learning methods by using neural networks that provide faster and more accurate systems than the current state-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the potential of the presented Compressive Meta-Learning framework, we explore multiple applications -- including neural network-based compressive PCA, compressive ridge regression, compressive k-means, and autoencoders.

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel approach to tackle the challenge of early forecasting of ICD codes at the beginning of a patient's stay in the hospital. By leveraging a multimodal system that combines clinical notes and tabular events from electronic health records, the model utilizes pre-trained encoders, feature pooling, and cross-modal attention to optimize representation learning across modalities. Additionally, a weighted temporal loss function is proposed to dynamically adjust its contribution at each temporal point, enhancing the predictive performance of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that these strategies outperform existing state-of-the-art systems in early prediction accuracy. This advancement could have significant implications in identifying health risks, recommending effective treatments, and improving resource allocation in healthcare settings.

Abstract: While the ICD code assignment problem has been widely studied, most works have focused on post-discharge document classification. Models for early forecasting of this information could be used for identifying health risks, suggesting effective treatments, or optimizing resource allocation. To address the challenge of predictive modeling using the limited information at the beginning of a patient stay, we propose a multimodal system to fuse clinical notes and tabular events captured in electronic health records. The model integrates pre-trained encoders, feature pooling, and cross-modal attention to learn optimal representations across modalities and balance their presence at every temporal point. Moreover, we present a weighted temporal loss that adjusts its contribution at each point in time. Experiments show that these strategies enhance the early prediction model, outperforming the current state-of-the-art systems.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the fashion industry and the growing variety of products have made it challenging for users to find compatible items on e-commerce platforms. Effective fashion recommendation systems are crucial for filtering irrelevant items and suggesting suitable ones. However, simultaneously addressing outfit compatibility and personalized recommendations remains a significant challenge, as these aspects are often treated independently in existing studies, often overlooking the complex interactions between items and user preferences. This research introduces a new framework named FGAT, inspired by the HFGN model, which leverages graph neural networks and graph attention mechanisms to tackle this issue. The proposed framework constructs a three-tier hierarchical graph of users, outfits, and items, integrating visual and textual features to simultaneously model outfit compatibility and user preferences. A graph attention mechanism dynamically weights node importance during representation propagation, enabling the capture of key interactions and generating precise representations for both user preferences and outfit compatibility. Evaluated on the POG dataset, FGAT outperforms baseline models such as HFGN, achieving improved results in precision, HR, recall, NDCG, and accuracy.These results demonstrate that combining multimodal visual-textual features with a hierarchical graph structure and attention mechanisms significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of personalized fashion recommendation systems.

Summary:<br /> 
This article discusses the use of piecewise-affine regularization (PAR) in optimization problems over discrete or quantized variables, particularly in supervised learning. The authors show that in the overparameterized regime, critical points of PAR-regularized loss functions exhibit high degrees of quantization. They also derive closed-form proximal mappings for various PARs and provide methods for solving PAR-regularized problems using gradient-based approaches. Statistical guarantees for PAR-regularized linear regression problems are studied, demonstrating that PAR can approximate traditional regularization techniques and achieve similar statistical guarantees with quantized solutions. Theoretical foundations of PAR are investigated from optimization and statistical perspectives, showcasing its flexibility and computational advantages in dealing with combinatorial search spaces. <div>

Abstract: Optimization problems over discrete or quantized variables are very challenging in general due to the combinatorial nature of their search space. Piecewise-affine regularization (PAR) provides a flexible modeling and computational framework for quantization based on continuous optimization. In this work, we focus on the setting of supervised learning and investigate the theoretical foundations of PAR from optimization and statistical perspectives. First, we show that in the overparameterized regime, where the number of parameters exceeds the number of samples, every critical point of the PAR-regularized loss function exhibits a high degree of quantization. Second, we derive closed-form proximal mappings for various (convex, quasi-convex, and non-convex) PARs and show how to solve PAR-regularized problems using the proximal gradient method, its accelerated variant, and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. Third, we study statistical guarantees of PAR-regularized linear regression problems; specifically, we can approximate classical formulations of $\ell_1$-, squared $\ell_2$-, and nonconvex regularizations using PAR and obtain similar statistical guarantees with quantized solutions.

Summary:
Clustered Transfer Residual Learning (CTRL) is introduced as a meta-learning method for machine learning tasks that involve large-scale data from multiple distinct sources. CTRL combines cross-domain residual learning and adaptive pooling/clustering to enhance overall accuracy while maintaining source-level heterogeneity. The method addresses challenges such as distributional shifts between data sources and varying sample sizes. The paper provides theoretical insights into how CTRL manages the trade-off between data quantity and quality. Evaluation on 5 datasets, including one from the national asylum program in Switzerland, shows that CTRL outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of predictive accuracy and performance with different base learners. The algorithmic geographic assignment of asylum seekers in Switzerland is currently being piloted using this method. <div>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) tasks often utilize large-scale data that is drawn from several distinct sources, such as different locations, treatment arms, or groups. In such settings, practitioners often desire predictions that not only exhibit good overall accuracy, but also remain reliable within each source and preserve the differences that matter across sources. For instance, several asylum and refugee resettlement programs now use ML-based employment predictions to guide where newly arriving families are placed within a host country, which requires generating informative and differentiated predictions for many and often small source locations. However, this task is made challenging by several common characteristics of the data in these settings: the presence of numerous distinct data sources, distributional shifts between them, and substantial variation in sample sizes across sources. This paper introduces Clustered Transfer Residual Learning (CTRL), a meta-learning method that combines the strengths of cross-domain residual learning and adaptive pooling/clustering in order to simultaneously improve overall accuracy and preserve source-level heterogeneity. We provide theoretical results that clarify how our objective navigates the trade-off between data quantity and data quality. We evaluate CTRL alongside other state-of-the-art benchmarks on 5 large-scale datasets. This includes a dataset from the national asylum program in Switzerland, where the algorithmic geographic assignment of asylum seekers is currently being piloted. CTRL consistently outperforms the benchmarks across several key metrics and when using a range of different base learners.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel approach to designing high-order Bayesian network classifiers by learning distributional representations for feature values. This method addresses the parameter explosion and data sparsity issues faced by conventional Bayesian network classifiers, allowing for better extrapolation of occurrence probabilities in complex real-world data. The proposed NeuralKDB classifier extends the K-dependence Bayesian classifier into a neural version, incorporating a neural network architecture to learn distributional representations of feature values and parameterize conditional probabilities between interdependent features. Through extensive classification experiments on 60 UCI datasets, the NeuralKDB classifier demonstrates superior capabilities in capturing high-order feature dependencies, outperforming conventional Bayesian network classifiers and competing neural network-based classifiers lacking distributional representation learning capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Bayesian network classifiers provide a feasible solution to tabular data classification, with a number of merits like high time and memory efficiency, and great explainability. However, due to the parameter explosion and data sparsity issues, Bayesian network classifiers are restricted to low-order feature dependency modeling, making them struggle in extrapolating the occurrence probabilities of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning distributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in word embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional representations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different features through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which then serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new test samples. As a classifier design realization, we remake the K-dependence Bayesian classifier (KDB) by extending it into a neural version, i.e., NeuralKDB, where a novel neural network architecture is designed to learn distributional representations of feature values and parameterize the conditional probabilities between interdependent features. A stochastic gradient descent based algorithm is designed to train the NeuralKDB model efficiently. Extensive classification experiments on 60 UCI datasets demonstrate that the proposed NeuralKDB classifier excels in capturing high-order feature dependencies and significantly outperforms the conventional Bayesian network classifiers, as well as other competitive classifiers, including two neural network based classifiers without distributional representation learning.

Summary:
In the realm of Internet of Things (IoT), the generation of vast amounts of multimodal data from various sources has led to the development of edge intelligence, enabling local processing of diverse data types. To effectively handle this data, a distributed online learning framework known as Multimodal Online Federated Learning (MMO-FL) has been introduced. However, the instability of IoT devices often causes imbalances in the quantity and quality of data modalities, which can hinder learning performance. In response to this challenge, the Modality Quantity and Quality Rebalanced (QQR) algorithm has been proposed to address the issues of modality imbalance during data collection. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on real-world datasets, the QQR algorithm has demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods, showcasing its efficacy in handling modality imbalance and enhancing learning outcomes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem produces massive volumes of multimodal data from diverse sources, including sensors, cameras, and microphones. With advances in edge intelligence, IoT devices have evolved from simple data acquisition units into computationally capable nodes, enabling localized processing of heterogeneous multimodal data. This evolution necessitates distributed learning paradigms that can efficiently handle such data. Furthermore, the continuous nature of data generation and the limited storage capacity of edge devices demand an online learning framework. Multimodal Online Federated Learning (MMO-FL) has emerged as a promising approach to meet these requirements. However, MMO-FL faces new challenges due to the inherent instability of IoT devices, which often results in modality quantity and quality imbalance (QQI) during data collection. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of QQI within the MMO-FL framework and present a comprehensive theoretical analysis quantifying how both types of imbalance degrade learning performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Modality Quantity and Quality Rebalanced (QQR) algorithm, a prototype learning based method designed to operate in parallel with the training process. Extensive experiments on two real-world multimodal datasets show that the proposed QQR algorithm consistently outperforms benchmarks under modality imbalance conditions with promising learning performance.

Summary: <br />
The article discusses a new semi-supervised generative model for multi-view learning, addressing the challenges of missing views and labels in real-life datasets. Prior approaches used probabilistic methods and the information bottleneck (IB) principle but were fully supervised and unable to leverage unlabeled data. The proposed model combines labeled and unlabeled samples to learn a shared latent space, maximizing the likelihood of unlabeled samples and performing cross-view mutual information maximization. The model outperforms existing approaches in predictive and imputation performance on image and multi-omics data with missing views and limited labeled samples. <div>
arXiv:2508.11180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view learning is widely applied to real-life datasets, such as multiple omics biological data, but it often suffers from both missing views and missing labels. Prior probabilistic approaches addressed the missing view problem by using a product-of-experts scheme to aggregate representations from present views and achieved superior performance over deterministic classifiers, using the information bottleneck (IB) principle. However, the IB framework is inherently fully supervised and cannot leverage unlabeled data. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised generative model that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled samples in a unified framework. Our method maximizes the likelihood of unlabeled samples to learn a latent space shared with the IB on labeled data. We also perform cross-view mutual information maximization in the latent space to enhance the extraction of shared information across views. Compared to existing approaches, our model achieves better predictive and imputation performance on both image and multi-omics data with missing views and limited labeled samples.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Quantum Boltzmann Machine-Variational Autoencoder (QBM-VAE) as a hybrid quantum-classical architecture that leverages a quantum processor to efficiently sample from the Boltzmann distribution. This approach overcomes the limitations of Gaussian priors in probabilistic deep learning by capturing complex non-Gaussian data landscapes, particularly in challenging domains like complex biological data. The QBM-VAE outperforms conventional deep learning models in tasks such as omics data integration, cell-type classification, and trajectory inference, demonstrating a practical quantum advantage in deep learning on large-scale scientific problems. By incorporating a physics prior into deep learning, the model acquires scientific discovery capabilities that break through data limitations. This work serves as a blueprint for developing hybrid quantum AI models and showcases the potential of quantum approaches in improving the fidelity and accuracy of deep generative models for scientific research. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental limitation of probabilistic deep learning is its predominant reliance on Gaussian priors. This simplistic assumption prevents models from accurately capturing the complex, non-Gaussian landscapes of natural data, particularly in demanding domains like complex biological data, severely hindering the fidelity of the model for scientific discovery. The physically-grounded Boltzmann distribution offers a more expressive alternative, but it is computationally intractable on classical computers. To date, quantum approaches have been hampered by the insufficient qubit scale and operational stability required for the iterative demands of deep learning. Here, we bridge this gap by introducing the Quantum Boltzmann Machine-Variational Autoencoder (QBM-VAE), a large-scale and long-time stable hybrid quantum-classical architecture. Our framework leverages a quantum processor for efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, enabling its use as a powerful prior within a deep generative model. Applied to million-scale single-cell datasets from multiple sources, the QBM-VAE generates a latent space that better preserves complex biological structures, consistently outperforming conventional Gaussian-based deep learning models like VAE and SCVI in essential tasks such as omics data integration, cell-type classification, and trajectory inference. It also provides a typical example of introducing a physics priori into deep learning to drive the model to acquire scientific discovery capabilities that breaks through data limitations. This work provides the demonstration of a practical quantum advantage in deep learning on a large-scale scientific problem and offers a transferable blueprint for developing hybrid quantum AI models.

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel modulation-based meta-learning framework for dynamics modeling that enables scalable and generalizable learning across parametric families of dynamical systems. The framework conditions structure-preserving models on compact latent representations of potentially unknown system parameters, eliminating the need for explicit knowledge of system parameters and costly retraining. By applying novel modulation strategies to parametric energy-conserving and dissipative systems, the approach achieves accurate predictions in few-shot learning settings. The models maintain essential physical constraints for dynamical stability and demonstrate effective generalization performance across parameter space. Experimental results on standard benchmark problems validate the approach's ability to accurately predict system behavior and adapt to new parameter settings with minimal training data. Overall, the framework offers a promising solution for efficient and robust dynamics modeling in scenarios with varying system parameters.

Abstract: Structure-preserving approaches to dynamics modeling have demonstrated great potential for modeling physical systems due to their strong inductive biases that enforce conservation laws and dissipative behavior. However, the resulting models are typically trained for fixed system configurations, requiring explicit knowledge of system parameters as well as costly retraining for each new set of parameters -- a major limitation in many-query or parameter-varying scenarios. Meta-learning offers a potential solution, but existing approaches like optimization-based meta-learning often suffer from training instability or limited generalization capability. Inspired by ideas from computer vision, we introduce a modulation-based meta-learning framework that directly conditions structure-preserving models on compact latent representations of potentially unknown system parameters, avoiding the need for gray-box system knowledge and explicit optimization during adaptation. Through the application of novel modulation strategies to parametric energy-conserving and dissipative systems, we enable scalable and generalizable learning across parametric families of dynamical systems. Experiments on standard benchmark problems demonstrate that our approach achieves accurate predictions in few-shot learning settings, without compromising on the essential physical constraints necessary for dynamical stability and effective generalization performance across parameter space.

Summary:  
The study proposes a new framework called Borrowing From the Future (BFF) for improving prediction performance in early-stage risk assessments for pediatric populations. BFF is a contrastive multi-modal framework that leverages information from later stages to enhance predictions at earlier stages. By treating each time window as a distinct modality, BFF allows the model to borrow informative signals from future stages to improve performance in early risk assessments. The framework was validated on two real-world pediatric outcome prediction tasks, showing consistent improvements in early risk assessments. The code for BFF is available on GitHub for reference and further research. <div>
arXiv:2508.11210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risk assessments for a pediatric population are often conducted across multiple stages. For example, clinicians may evaluate risks prenatally, at birth, and during Well-Child visits. Although predictions made at later stages typically achieve higher precision, it is clinically desirable to make reliable risk assessments as early as possible. Therefore, this study focuses on improving prediction performance in early-stage risk assessments. Our solution, \textbf{Borrowing From the Future (BFF)}, is a contrastive multi-modal framework that treats each time window as a distinct modality. In BFF, a model is trained on all available data throughout the time while performing a risk assessment using up-to-date information. This contrastive framework allows the model to ``borrow'' informative signals from later stages (e.g., Well-Child visits) to implicitly supervise the learning at earlier stages (e.g., prenatal/birth stages). We validate BFF on two real-world pediatric outcome prediction tasks, demonstrating consistent improvements in early risk assessments. The code is available at https://github.com/scotsun/bff.

Summary:
In this article, the authors explore the implementation of computations over representations within a system through the lens of causality, specifically focusing on the theory of causal abstraction. They discuss how classical philosophical ideas about computation and cognition are relevant to contemporary machine learning, particularly in the context of deep learning with artificial neural networks. The authors propose an account of computational implementation rooted in causal abstraction and examine the role of representation in this framework. They argue that these issues are best understood in relation to generalization and prediction, highlighting the importance of considering these factors when studying cognitive behavior and computational processes. Overall, the article underscores the significance of causal abstraction in understanding how systems implement computations over representations and the implications for advancing our understanding of cognitive behavior.

Abstract: Explanations of cognitive behavior often appeal to computations over representations. What does it take for a system to implement a given computation over suitable representational vehicles within that system? We argue that the language of causality -- and specifically the theory of causal abstraction -- provides a fruitful lens on this topic. Drawing on current discussions in deep learning with artificial neural networks, we illustrate how classical themes in the philosophy of computation and cognition resurface in contemporary machine learning. We offer an account of computational implementation grounded in causal abstraction, and examine the role for representation in the resulting picture. We argue that these issues are most profitably explored in connection with generalization and prediction.

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces a hybrid CNN-LSTM model for predicting PM2.5 concentration in the context of global climate change. The model combines CNN for local spatial features and LSTM for temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional models with an RMSE of 5.236. The dataset used covers hourly records of various atmospheric factors from an industrial area in Beijing. The model forecasts average PM2.5 concentration over 6-hour intervals, showing great potential for applications like air pollution early warning systems. However, its high computational demand and need for optimization in handling diverse atmospheric factors require further research. Future work aims to enhance scalability and support more complex multivariate weather prediction tasks. <div>

Abstract: With the intensification of global climate change, accurate prediction of air quality indicators, especially PM2.5 concentration, has become increasingly important in fields such as environmental protection, public health, and urban management. To address this, we propose an air quality PM2.5 index prediction model based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The model effectively combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for local spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies in time series data. Using a multivariate dataset collected from an industrial area in Beijing between 2010 and 2015 -- which includes hourly records of PM2.5 concentration, temperature, dew point, pressure, wind direction, wind speed, and precipitation -- the model predicts the average PM2.5 concentration over 6-hour intervals. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.236, outperforming traditional time series models in both accuracy and generalization. This demonstrates its strong potential in real-world applications such as air pollution early warning systems. However, due to the complexity of multivariate inputs, the model demands high computational resources, and its ability to handle diverse atmospheric factors still requires optimization. Future work will focus on enhancing scalability and expanding support for more complex multivariate weather prediction tasks.

arXiv:2508.11249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in developing diffusion-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), building on the connections between message passing mechanisms in GNNs and physical diffusion processes. However, existing methods suffer from three critical limitations: (1) they rely on homogeneous diffusion with static dynamics, limiting adaptability to diverse graph structures; (2) their depth is constrained by computational overhead and diminishing interpretability; and (3) theoretical understanding of their convergence behavior remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose GODNF, a Generalized Opinion Dynamics Neural Framework, which unifies multiple opinion dynamics models into a principled, trainable diffusion mechanism. Our framework captures heterogeneous diffusion patterns and temporal dynamics via node-specific behavior modeling and dynamic neighborhood influence, while ensuring efficient and interpretable message propagation even at deep layers. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating GODNF's ability to model diverse convergence configurations. Extensive empirical evaluations of node classification and influence estimation tasks confirm GODNF's superiority over state-of-the-art GNNs.

Summary:
In this new article, a framework is proposed for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via prompting. The LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and probabilistic predictions are used to elicit features for fair classification. The framework allows for the training of lightweight fair classifiers in a post-hoc manner. Experiments on five datasets show strong accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for classifiers derived from both open-weight and closed-weight LLMs. The framework is data-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings or from scratch on raw tabular features. This approach addresses the challenge of enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers under the in-context learning setting, making it applicable to advanced commercial models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. <div>
arXiv:2508.11258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) enable a simple zero-shot or few-shot prompting paradigm, also known as in-context learning, for building prediction models. This convenience, combined with continued advances in LLM capability, has the potential to drive their adoption across a broad range of domains, including high-stakes applications where group fairness -- preventing disparate impacts across demographic groups -- is essential. The majority of existing approaches to enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers rely on traditional fair algorithms applied via model fine-tuning or head-tuning on final-layer embeddings, but they are no longer applicable to closed-weight LLMs under the in-context learning setting, which include some of the most capable commercial models today, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. In this paper, we propose a framework for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via prompting: the LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and features are elicited from its probabilistic predictions (e.g., token log probabilities) using prompts strategically designed for the specified fairness criterion to obtain sufficient statistics for fair classification; a fair algorithm is then applied to these features to train a lightweight fair classifier in a post-hoc manner. Experiments on five datasets, including three tabular ones, demonstrate strong accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for the classifiers derived by our framework from both open-weight and closed-weight LLMs; in particular, our framework is data-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings (i.e., head-tuning) or from scratch on raw tabular features.

Summary: 
- The study investigates the vulnerability of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to adversarial perturbations and introduces the concept of temporal ensembling for analyzing their robustness.
- Two main challenges are identified: the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the transfer of adversarial vulnerabilities across time.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising direction for energy-efficient and brain-inspired computing, yet their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the adversarial robustness of SNNs through the lens of temporal ensembling, treating the network as a collection of evolving sub-networks across discrete timesteps. This formulation uncovers two critical but underexplored challenges-the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the tendency for adversarial vulnerabilities to transfer across time. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE), a training framework that improves the robustness of each sub-network while reducing the temporal transferability of adversarial perturbations. RTE integrates both objectives into a unified loss and employs a stochastic sampling strategy for efficient optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that RTE consistently outperforms existing training methods in robust-accuracy trade-off. Additional analyses reveal that RTE reshapes the internal robustness landscape of SNNs, leading to more resilient and temporally diversified decision boundaries. Our study highlights the importance of temporal structure in adversarial learning and offers a principled foundation for building robust spiking models.

<div> Keywords: graph pre-training, prompt-tuning, spectral specificity, HS-GPPT model, knowledge transfer <br />
Summary: <br />
Graph "pre-training and prompt-tuning" aims to align downstream tasks with pre-trained objectives for efficient knowledge transfer with limited supervision. However, existing methods struggle with diverse spectral distributions in real-world graphs due to varying homophily levels. The spectral specificity principle suggests that optimal knowledge transfer requires alignment between pre-trained spectral filters and downstream graph spectra. The HS-GPPT model addresses this challenge by ensuring spectral alignment through both pre-training and prompt-tuning. It leverages hybrid spectral filter backbones and local-global contrastive learning to acquire comprehensive spectral knowledge. Prompts are designed to align spectral distributions with pretexts, enabling effective spectral knowledge transfer across homophily and heterophily. Extensive experiments validate the model's effectiveness under transductive and inductive learning settings. <div>

Abstract: Graph ``pre-training and prompt-tuning'' aligns downstream tasks with pre-trained objectives to enable efficient knowledge transfer under limited supervision. However, existing methods rely on homophily-based low-frequency knowledge, failing to handle diverse spectral distributions in real-world graphs with varying homophily. Our theoretical analysis reveals a spectral specificity principle: optimal knowledge transfer requires alignment between pre-trained spectral filters and the intrinsic spectrum of downstream graphs. Under limited supervision, large spectral gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks impede effective adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose the HS-GPPT model, a novel framework that ensures spectral alignment throughout both pre-training and prompt-tuning. We utilize a hybrid spectral filter backbone and local-global contrastive learning to acquire abundant spectral knowledge. Then we design prompt graphs to align the spectral distribution with pretexts, facilitating spectral knowledge transfer across homophily and heterophily. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness under both transductive and inductive learning settings. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HS-GPPT-62D2/.

<div> Keywords: RegimeNAS, differentiable architecture search, cryptocurrency trading, market regime awareness, Bayesian search space<br />
Summary: <br />
RegimeNAS is introduced as a differentiable architecture search framework tailored for cryptocurrency trading with a focus on market regime awareness. It incorporates Bayesian search space optimization with provable convergence properties. The framework includes specialized neural modules for different market conditions and a multi-objective loss function with market-specific penalties. Regime identification is enhanced through multi-head attention across multiple timeframes for improved accuracy. Empirical evaluation shows that RegimeNAS outperforms existing benchmarks, reducing Mean Absolute Error by 80.3% and converging faster in fewer epochs. Ablation studies and regime-specific analysis highlight the importance of each component, especially the regime-aware adaptation mechanism. This work emphasizes the necessity of integrating domain-specific knowledge, such as market regimes, into architecture search processes to create robust and adaptive models for complex financial applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We introduce RegimeNAS, a novel differentiable architecture search framework specifically designed to enhance cryptocurrency trading performance by explicitly integrating market regime awareness. Addressing the limitations of static deep learning models in highly dynamic financial environments, RegimeNAS features three core innovations: (1) a theoretically grounded Bayesian search space optimizing architectures with provable convergence properties; (2) specialized, dynamically activated neural modules (Volatility, Trend, and Range blocks) tailored for distinct market conditions; and (3) a multi-objective loss function incorporating market-specific penalties (e.g., volatility matching, transition smoothness) alongside mathematically enforced Lipschitz stability constraints. Regime identification leverages multi-head attention across multiple timeframes for improved accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Rigorous empirical evaluation on extensive real-world cryptocurrency data demonstrates that RegimeNAS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving an 80.3% Mean Absolute Error reduction compared to the best traditional recurrent baseline and converging substantially faster (9 vs. 50+ epochs). Ablation studies and regime-specific analysis confirm the critical contribution of each component, particularly the regime-aware adaptation mechanism. This work underscores the imperative of embedding domain-specific knowledge, such as market regimes, directly within the NAS process to develop robust and adaptive models for challenging financial applications.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular method for uncertainty quantification that converts a pretrained model's point prediction into a prediction set, with the set size reflecting the model's confidence. Although existing CP methods are guaranteed to achieve marginal coverage, they often exhibit imbalanced coverage across classes under long-tail label distributions, tending to over cover the head classes at the expense of under covering the remaining tail classes. This under coverage is particularly concerning, as it undermines the reliability of the prediction sets for minority classes, even with coverage ensured on average. In this paper, we propose the Tail-Aware Conformal Prediction (TACP) method to mitigate the under coverage of the tail classes by utilizing the long-tail structure and narrowing the head-tail coverage gap. Theoretical analysis shows that it consistently achieves a smaller head-tail coverage gap than standard methods. To further improve coverage balance across all classes, we introduce an extension of TACP: soft TACP (sTACP) via a reweighting mechanism. The proposed framework can be combined with various non-conformity scores, and experiments on multiple long-tail benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.11348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing incorporation of deep neural network (DNN) models into modern software systems, the prohibitive construction costs have become a significant challenge. Model reuse has been widely applied to reduce training costs, but indiscriminately reusing entire models may incur significant inference overhead. Consequently, DNN modularization has gained attention, enabling module reuse by decomposing DNN models. The emerging modularizing-while-training (MwT) paradigm, which incorporates modularization into training, outperforms modularizing-after-training approaches. However, existing MwT methods focus on small-scale CNN models at the convolutional kernel level and struggle with diverse DNNs and large-scale models, particularly Transformer-based models. To address these limitations, we propose NeMo, a scalable and generalizable MwT approach. NeMo operates at the neuron level fundamental component common to all DNNs-ensuring applicability to Transformers and various architectures. We design a contrastive learning-based modular training method with an effective composite loss function, enabling scalability to large-scale models. Comprehensive experiments on two Transformer-based models and four CNN models across two classification datasets demonstrate NeMo's superiority over state-of-the-art MwT methods. Results show average gains of 1.72% in module classification accuracy and 58.10% reduction in module size, demonstrating efficacy across both CNN and large-scale Transformer-based models. A case study on open-source projects shows NeMo's potential benefits in practical scenarios, offering a promising approach for scalable and generalizable DNN modularization.

<div> Dataset, afforestation, reforestation, carbon sequestration, location data integrity score
Summary: 
- A dataset on global afforestation and reforestation efforts has been compiled from primary information and satellite imagery to enhance data reliability and project integrity.
- The dataset covers 1,289,068 planting sites from 45,628 projects spanning 33 years.
- A standardized assessment of location data integrity is introduced through the Location Data Integrity Score (LDIS), with approximately 79% of planting sites failing on at least 1 out of 10 LDIS indicators.
- 15% of monitored projects lack machine-readable georeferenced data.
- The dataset not only improves accountability in the voluntary carbon market but also serves as valuable training data for computer vision tasks with millions of linked satellite images.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Afforestation and reforestation are popular strategies for mitigating climate change by enhancing carbon sequestration. However, the effectiveness of these efforts is often self-reported by project developers, or certified through processes with limited external validation. This leads to concerns about data reliability and project integrity. In response to increasing scrutiny of voluntary carbon markets, this study presents a dataset on global afforestation and reforestation efforts compiled from primary (meta-)information and augmented with time-series satellite imagery and other secondary data. Our dataset covers 1,289,068 planting sites from 45,628 projects spanning 33 years. Since any remote sensing-based validation effort relies on the integrity of a planting site's geographic boundary, this dataset introduces a standardized assessment of the provided site-level location information, which we summarize in one easy-to-communicate key indicator: LDIS -- the Location Data Integrity Score. We find that approximately 79\% of the georeferenced planting sites monitored fail on at least 1 out of 10 LDIS indicators, while 15\% of the monitored projects lack machine-readable georeferenced data in the first place. In addition to enhancing accountability in the voluntary carbon market, the presented dataset also holds value as training data for e.g. computer vision-related tasks with millions of linked Sentinel-2 and Planetscope satellite images.

HGD aims to prevent under-fitting for minor classes, improving balance in online learning without requiring additional data-buffer or parameters. The algorithm operates seamlessly within models utilizing gradient descent for optimization. Theoretical analysis demonstrates HGD's ability to achieve a sub-linear regret bound under common assumptions. Comparison with existing online imbalance learning methods in various scenarios highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of HGD in handling imbalanced data streams. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm the algorithm's success in mitigating imbalance issues and achieving balanced learning outcomes. HGD presents a promising approach to tackling the challenges posed by imbalanced data streams in real-world applications.

Abstract: Many real-world data are sequentially collected over time and often exhibit skewed class distributions, resulting in imbalanced data streams. While existing approaches have explored several strategies, such as resampling and reweighting, for imbalanced data stream learning, our work distinguishes itself by addressing the imbalance problem through training modification, particularly focusing on gradient descent techniques. We introduce the harmonized gradient descent (HGD) algorithm, which aims to equalize the norms of gradients across different classes. By ensuring the gradient norm balance, HGD mitigates under-fitting for minor classes and achieves balanced online learning. Notably, HGD operates in a streamlined implementation process, requiring no data-buffer, extra parameters, or prior knowledge, making it applicable to any learning models utilizing gradient descent for optimization. Theoretical analysis, based on a few common and mild assumptions, shows that HGD achieves a satisfied sub-linear regret bound. The proposed algorithm are compared with the commonly used online imbalance learning methods under several imbalanced data stream scenarios. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of HGD in learning imbalanced data streams.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have yielded significant improvements in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, these models remain heavily dependent on annotated data and exhibit limited adaptability in unsupervised scenarios. To address these limitations, test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) has been proposed, which enables self-optimization by leveraging model-generated pseudo-labels. Despite its promise, TTRL faces several key challenges, including high inference costs due to parallel rollouts and early-stage estimation bias that fosters overconfidence, reducing output diversity and causing performance plateaus. To address these challenges, we introduce an entropy-based mechanism to enhance the exploration-exploitation balance in test-time reinforcement learning through two strategies: Entropy-fork Tree Majority Rollout (ETMR) and Entropy-based Advantage Reshaping (EAR). Compared with the baseline, our approach enables Llama3.1-8B to achieve a 68 percent relative improvement in Pass at 1 metric on the AIME 2024 benchmark, while consuming only 60 percent of the rollout tokens budget. This highlights our method's ability to effectively optimize the trade-off between inference efficiency, diversity, and estimation robustness, thereby advancing unsupervised reinforcement learning for open-domain reasoning tasks.

Summary: <br /> 
The paper introduces PTSM, a novel framework for EEG decoding across different subjects in brain-computer interface research. PTSM utilizes personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns through dual-branch masking to capture individual-specific neural characteristics while extracting task-relevant features. By factorizing masks across temporal and spatial dimensions, PTSM can modulate dynamic EEG patterns efficiently. Information-theoretic constraints are enforced to separate latent embeddings into task-related and subject-related subspaces, improving zero-shot generalization. The model is trained end-to-end with a multi-objective loss function, incorporating classification, contrastive, and disentanglement objectives. Experimental results on cross-subject motor imagery datasets demonstrate PTSM's superior performance compared to existing methods, showcasing the effectiveness of disentangled neural representations for personalized and transferable decoding in non-stationary neurophysiological settings. <div>

Abstract: Cross-subject electroencephalography (EEG) decoding remains a fundamental challenge in brain-computer interface (BCI) research due to substantial inter-subject variability and the scarcity of subject-invariant representations. This paper proposed PTSM (Physiology-aware and Task-invariant Spatio-temporal Modeling), a novel framework for interpretable and robust EEG decoding across unseen subjects. PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism that independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns, enabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while extracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized across temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of dynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead. To further address representational entanglement, PTSM enforces information-theoretic constraints that decompose latent embeddings into orthogonal task-related and subject-related subspaces. The model is trained end-to-end via a multi-objective loss integrating classification, contrastive, and disentanglement objectives. Extensive experiments on cross-subject motor imagery datasets demonstrate that PTSM achieves strong zero-shot generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without subject-specific calibration. Results highlight the efficacy of disentangled neural representations for achieving both personalized and transferable decoding in non-stationary neurophysiological settings.

Abstract: We present Dual-Feedback Actor (DFA), a reinforcement learning algorithm that fuses both individual rewards and pairwise preferences (if available) into a single update rule. DFA uses the policy's log-probabilities directly to model the preference probability, avoiding a separate reward-modeling step. Preferences can be provided by human-annotators (at state-level or trajectory-level) or be synthesized online from Q-values stored in an off-policy replay buffer. Under a Bradley-Terry model, we prove that minimizing DFA's preference loss recovers the entropy-regularized Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) policy. Our simulation results show that DFA trained on generated preferences matches or exceeds SAC on six control environments and demonstrates a more stable training process. With only a semi-synthetic preference dataset under Bradley-Terry model, our algorithm outperforms reward-modeling reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) baselines in a stochastic GridWorld and approaches the performance of an oracle with true rewards.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper discusses Decision-focused learning (DFL), which aims to train ML models to predict optimization problem parameters to minimize decision regret and maximize decision quality. It highlights the challenges in computing the gradient in optimization problems like linear programs where the regret gradient is zero in most cases. Existing approaches either smooth the problem or minimize surrogate losses to address this issue. The paper proposes minimizing surrogate losses even when a differentiable optimization layer is used, showing comparable or better regret results than existing methods. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach with DYS-Net, a differentiable optimization technique for LPs. By minimizing surrogate losses with DYS-Net, the study achieves state-of-the-art regret levels while significantly reducing training time. <div>
arXiv:2508.11365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) trains a machine learning (ML) model to predict parameters of an optimization problem, to directly minimize decision regret, i.e., maximize decision quality. Gradient-based DFL requires computing the derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the predicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear programs (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted parameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches for LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP into a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer and then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that have informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former approach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the regret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address this, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable optimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly. Our experiments demonstrate that minimizing surrogate losses allows differentiable optimization layers to achieve regret comparable to or better than surrogate-loss based DFL methods. Further, we demonstrate that this also holds for DYS-Net, a recently proposed differentiable optimization technique for LPs, that computes approximate solutions and gradients through operations that can be performed using feedforward neural network layers. Because DYS-Net executes the forward and the backward pass very efficiently, by minimizing surrogate losses using DYS-Net, we are able to attain regret on par with the state-of-the-art while reducing training time by a significant margin.

Summary: <br />
This article introduces a structural lifting strategy for Graph Neural Networks using Forman-Ricci curvature to capture higher-order topological domains. Geometric and Topological Deep Learning addresses complex interactions in real-world networks by transforming basic graph forms to more expressive topologies. Forman-Ricci curvature reveals local and global graph properties, highlighting backbones that form connections between major communities. These backbones, represented as hyperedges, help model information flows between clusters across large distances, preventing information distortion and graph bottlenecks. The proposed approach aims to remedy the problem of over-squashing in message passing across long distances, enhancing the performance of GNN models in capturing complex network structures. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.11390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks are highly effective at learning from relational data, leveraging node and edge features while maintaining the symmetries inherent to graph structures. However, many real-world systems, such as social or biological networks, exhibit complex interactions that are more naturally represented by higher-order topological domains. The emerging field of Geometric and Topological Deep Learning addresses this challenge by introducing methods that utilize and benefit from higher-order structures. Central to TDL is the concept of lifting, which transforms data representations from basic graph forms to more expressive topologies before the application of GNN models for learning. In this work, we propose a structural lifting strategy using Forman-Ricci curvature, which defines an edge-based network characteristic based on Riemannian geometry. Curvature reveals local and global properties of a graph, such as a network's backbones, i.e. coarse, structure-preserving graph geometries that form connections between major communities - most suitably represented as hyperedges to model information flows between clusters across large distances in the network. To this end, our approach provides a remedy to the problem of information distortion in message passing across long distances and graph bottlenecks - a phenomenon known in graph learning as over-squashing.

Summary: <br /><br /> The study introduces the CHORD framework, which integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs). CHORD reframes SFT as a dynamically weighted auxiliary objective within on-policy RL and incorporates a dual-control mechanism to balance off-policy imitation and on-policy exploration. By utilizing a global coefficient and token-wise weighting function, CHORD effectively harmonizes expert data with exploration, leading to stable and efficient learning processes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CHORD outperforms baseline methods, showcasing significant improvements in performance. The implementation of CHORD is made available on GitHub to facilitate further research in this area. <div>
arXiv:2508.11408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two prominent post-training paradigms for refining the capabilities and aligning the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches that integrate SFT and RL often face the risk of disrupting established model patterns and inducing overfitting to expert data. To address this, we present a novel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy versus on-policy lens. We propose CHORD, a framework for the Controllable Harmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic Weighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically weighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an analysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular levels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the framework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the transition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies a token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from expert tokens, which preserves on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from off-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, providing empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient learning process. By effectively harmonizing off-policy expert data with on-policy exploration, CHORD demonstrates significant improvements over baselines.

<div> Keywords: deep generative models, antibody sequence, structure optimization, latent space, property optimization<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Advancements in deep generative models have allowed for the joint modeling of antibody sequence and structure, with the antigen-antibody complex as context. However, current methods for optimizing complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are inefficient due to costly evaluations in the raw data space. To address this issue, the LatEnt blAck-box Design (LEAD) framework is proposed, optimizing sequence and structure within a shared latent space. By optimizing shared latent codes, LEAD overcomes limitations of existing methods and ensures sync between different modality designs. A black-box guidance strategy is designed for scenarios where property evaluators are non-differentiable. Experimental results show that LEAD outperforms baseline methods in property optimization, reducing query consumption by half. The code for LEAD is available at https://github.com/EvaFlower/LatEnt-blAck-box-Design. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Advancements in deep generative models have enabled the joint modeling of antibody sequence and structure, given the antigen-antibody complex as context. However, existing approaches for optimizing complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) to improve developability properties operate in the raw data space, leading to excessively costly evaluations due to the inefficient search process. To address this, we propose LatEnt blAck-box Design (LEAD), a sequence-structure co-design framework that optimizes both sequence and structure within their shared latent space. Optimizing shared latent codes can not only break through the limitations of existing methods, but also ensure synchronization of different modality designs. Particularly, we design a black-box guidance strategy to accommodate real-world scenarios where many property evaluators are non-differentiable. Experimental results demonstrate that our LEAD achieves superior optimization performance for both single and multi-property objectives. Notably, LEAD reduces query consumption by a half while surpassing baseline methods in property optimization. The code is available at https://github.com/EvaFlower/LatEnt-blAck-box-Design.

Summary:
Contractive Convolutional Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) leverage contraction theory to enhance robustness against input noise and adversarial attacks. By inducing contractivity during training through regularization terms related to the system dynamics, these networks exhibit improved resilience to slight input perturbations. Weight regularization techniques can also be employed to promote contractivity, particularly for NODEs with restricted activation function slopes, while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regularization methods in enhancing the robustness of Contractive Convolutional NODEs against various forms of noise and attacks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Neural networks can be fragile to input noise and adversarial attacks.
  In this work, we consider Convolutional Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), a family of continuous-depth neural networks represented by dynamical systems, and propose to use contraction theory to improve their robustness.
  For a contractive dynamical system two trajectories starting from different initial conditions converge to each other exponentially fast.
  Contractive Convolutional NODEs can enjoy increased robustness as slight perturbations of the features do not cause a significant change in the output.
  Contractivity can be induced during training by using a regularization term involving the Jacobian of the system dynamics.
  To reduce the computational burden, we show that it can also be promoted using carefully selected weight regularization terms for a class of NODEs with slope-restricted activation functions.
  The performance of the proposed regularizers is illustrated through benchmark image classification tasks on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, where images are corrupted by different kinds of noise and attacks.

<div> Reservoir Computing, Brain templates, BOLD signals, Multi-sensory, Cognitive<br />
Summary:<br /> 
The article introduces mCOCO, a framework that uses Reservoir Computing to learn population-level functional Connectional Brain Templates (CBTs) from BOLD signals. mCOCO addresses limitations of existing methods by enhancing interpretability, tracking state changes, and modeling brain dynamics. It integrates multi-sensory inputs to capture how brain regions process information and adapt to cognitive tasks efficiently. The framework involves mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional connectomes and aggregating them into a group-level CBT. It then incorporates multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive reservoir to endow the CBT with cognitive traits, enhancing its performance in terms of centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory memory retention compared to GNN-based CBT. The source code is available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.11436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of connectional brain templates (CBTs) has recently garnered significant attention for its potential to identify unique connectivity patterns shared across individuals. However, existing methods for CBT learning such as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are hindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due to their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive focus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the generated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory COgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC) to learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD (Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow for tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling the modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By integrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO captures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process information and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a computationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases: (1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional connectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to the best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity studies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive reservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show that our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms of centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory memory retention. Our source code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/mCOCO.

<br />
Summary: In this paper, the authors propose a learning-theory-based framework to evaluate the informativeness of explanations provided by local post-hoc explanation algorithms for complex machine learning models. They define an explanation as informative if it reduces the complexity of plausible decision functions. The study demonstrates that popular explanation algorithms may not be informative when applied to complex decision functions, offering a mathematical rejection of the assumption that all models can be explained. The authors establish conditions under which different explanation algorithms become informative and reveal that modifications may be necessary to achieve informativeness. For example, gradient and counterfactual explanations are non-informative for differentiable functions, while SHAP and anchor explanations lack informativeness for decision trees. These findings have significant implications for the practical applicability of explanation algorithms in auditing, regulation, and high-risk AI applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Many researchers have suggested that local post-hoc explanation algorithms can be used to gain insights into the behavior of complex machine learning models. However, theoretical guarantees about such algorithms only exist for simple decision functions, and it is unclear whether and under which assumptions similar results might exist for complex models. In this paper, we introduce a general, learning-theory-based framework for what it means for an explanation to provide information about a decision function. We call an explanation informative if it serves to reduce the complexity of the space of plausible decision functions. With this approach, we show that many popular explanation algorithms are not informative when applied to complex decision functions, providing a rigorous mathematical rejection of the idea that it should be possible to explain any model. We then derive conditions under which different explanation algorithms become informative. These are often stronger than what one might expect. For example, gradient explanations and counterfactual explanations are non-informative with respect to the space of differentiable functions, and SHAP and anchor explanations are not informative with respect to the space of decision trees. Based on these results, we discuss how explanation algorithms can be modified to become informative. While the proposed analysis of explanation algorithms is mathematical, we argue that it holds strong implications for the practical applicability of these algorithms, particularly for auditing, regulation, and high-risk applications of AI.

Summary:
This study investigates six probabilistic machine learning algorithms on their ability to estimate class probability and uncertainty. Through rigorous testing on synthetic datasets, the algorithms were evaluated for properties such as calibration and the ability to reflect uncertainty for out-of-distribution data points. The findings reveal that all algorithms were well calibrated, but deep learning-based algorithms did not consistently provide uncertainties that accurately reflected evidence for out-of-distribution data points. The study serves as a valuable example for researchers working on uncertainty estimation in data-driven modeling for scientific discoveries. <div>

Abstract: Rigorous statistical methods, including parameter estimation with accompanying uncertainties, underpin the validity of scientific discovery, especially in the natural sciences. With increasingly complex data models such as deep learning techniques, uncertainty quantification has become exceedingly difficult and a plethora of techniques have been proposed. In this case study, we use the unifying framework of approximate Bayesian inference combined with empirical tests on carefully created synthetic classification datasets to investigate qualitative properties of six different probabilistic machine learning algorithms for class probability and uncertainty estimation: (i) a neural network ensemble, (ii) neural network ensemble with conflictual loss, (iii) evidential deep learning, (iv) a single neural network with Monte Carlo Dropout, (v) Gaussian process classification and (vi) a Dirichlet process mixture model. We check if the algorithms produce uncertainty estimates which reflect commonly desired properties, such as being well calibrated and exhibiting an increase in uncertainty for out-of-distribution data points. Our results indicate that all algorithms are well calibrated, but none of the deep learning based algorithms provide uncertainties that consistently reflect lack of experimental evidence for out-of-distribution data points. We hope our study may serve as a clarifying example for researchers developing new methods of uncertainty estimation for scientific data-driven modeling.

This study introduces a curated dataset from Ohio encompassing over 3 million people involved in accidents from 2017 to 2022. By employing Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and explainable artificial intelligence (AI), the study identifies key risk factors in severe crashes. The Ridge Logistic Regression model achieved an AUC-ROC of 85.6% on the training set and 84.9% on the test set, highlighting 17 influential predictors across demographic, environmental, vehicle, human, and operational categories. Notably, traditional factors like alcohol impairment were less influential compared to location type, posted speed, minimum occupant age, and pre-crash action. The study emphasizes transparency and interpretability to support Vision Zero initiatives, providing a framework for data-driven traffic safety policies. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Motor vehicle crashes remain a leading cause of injury and death worldwide, necessitating data-driven approaches to understand and mitigate crash severity. This study introduces a curated dataset of more than 3 million people involved in accidents in Ohio over six years (2017-2022), aggregated to more than 2.3 million vehicle-level records for predictive analysis. The primary contribution is a transparent and reproducible methodology that combines Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and interpret key risk factors associated with severe crashes. Using the JADBio AutoML platform, predictive models were constructed to distinguish between severe and non-severe crash outcomes. The models underwent rigorous feature selection across stratified training subsets, and their outputs were interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to quantify the contribution of individual features. A final Ridge Logistic Regression model achieved an AUC-ROC of 85.6% on the training set and 84.9% on a hold-out test set, with 17 features consistently identified as the most influential predictors. Key features spanned demographic, environmental, vehicle, human, and operational categories, including location type, posted speed, minimum occupant age, and pre-crash action. Notably, certain traditionally emphasized factors, such as alcohol or drug impairment, were less influential in the final model compared to environmental and contextual variables. Emphasizing methodological rigor and interpretability over mere predictive performance, this study offers a scalable framework to support Vision Zero with aligned interventions and advanced data-informed traffic safety policy.

<title>Towards Faithful Class-level Self-explainability in Graph Neural Networks by Subgraph Dependencies</title>

arXiv:2508.11513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the interpretability of graph neural networks (GNNs) is crucial to ensure their safe and fair deployment. Recent work has introduced self-explainable GNNs that generate explanations as part of training, improving both faithfulness and efficiency. Some of these models, such as ProtGNN and PGIB, learn class-specific prototypes, offering a potential pathway toward class-level explanations. However, their evaluations focus solely on instance-level explanations, leaving open the question of whether these prototypes meaningfully generalize across instances of the same class. In this paper, we introduce GraphOracle, a novel self-explainable GNN framework designed to generate and evaluate class-level explanations for GNNs. Our model jointly learns a GNN classifier and a set of structured, sparse subgraphs that are discriminative for each class. We propose a novel integrated training that captures graph$\unicode{x2013}$subgraph$\unicode{x2013}$prediction dependencies efficiently and faithfully, validated through a masking-based evaluation strategy. This strategy enables us to retroactively assess whether prior methods like ProtGNN and PGIB deliver effective class-level explanations. Our results show that they do not. In contrast, GraphOracle achieves superior fidelity, explainability, and scalability across a range of graph classification tasks. We further demonstrate that GraphOracle avoids the computational bottlenecks of previous methods$\unicode{x2014}$like Monte Carlo Tree Search$\unicode{x2014}$by using entropy-regularized subgraph selection and lightweight random walk extraction, enabling faster and more scalable training. These findings position GraphOracle as a practical and principled solution for faithful class-level self-explainability in GNNs.

<title>DiCriTest: Testing Scenario Generation for Decision-Making Agents Considering Diversity and Criticality</title>

arXiv:2508.11514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing deployment of decision-making agents in dynamic environments increases the demand for safety verification. While critical testing scenario generation has emerged as an appealing verification methodology, effectively balancing diversity and criticality remains a key challenge for existing methods, particularly due to local optima entrapment in high-dimensional scenario spaces. To address this limitation, we propose a dual-space guided testing framework that coordinates scenario parameter space and agent behavior space, aiming to generate testing scenarios considering diversity and criticality. Specifically, in the scenario parameter space, a hierarchical representation framework combines dimensionality reduction and multi-dimensional subspace evaluation to efficiently localize diverse and critical subspaces. This guides dynamic coordination between two generation modes: local perturbation and global exploration, optimizing critical scenario quantity and diversity. Complementarily, in the agent behavior space, agent-environment interaction data are leveraged to quantify behavioral criticality/diversity and adaptively support generation mode switching, forming a closed feedback loop that continuously enhances scenario characterization and exploration within the parameter space. Experiments show our framework improves critical scenario generation by an average of 56.23\% and demonstrates greater diversity under novel parameter-behavior co-driven metrics when tested on five decision-making agents, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

arXiv:2508.11522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural tangent kernels (NTKs) are a powerful tool for analyzing deep, non-linear neural networks. In the infinite-width limit, NTKs can easily be computed for most common architectures, yielding full analytic control over the training dynamics. However, at infinite width, important properties of training such as NTK evolution or feature learning are absent. Nevertheless, finite width effects can be included by computing corrections to the Gaussian statistics at infinite width. We introduce Feynman diagrams for computing finite-width corrections to NTK statistics. These dramatically simplify the necessary algebraic manipulations and enable the computation of layer-wise recursive relations for arbitrary statistics involving preactivations, NTKs and certain higher-derivative tensors (dNTK and ddNTK) required to predict the training dynamics at leading order. We demonstrate the feasibility of our framework by extending stability results for deep networks from preactivations to NTKs and proving the absence of finite-width corrections for scale-invariant nonlinearities such as ReLU on the diagonal of the Gram matrix of the NTK. We validate our results with numerical experiments.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a physics-informed diffusion model for multivariate time series data. Over the past years, diffusion model has demonstrated its effectiveness in forecasting, imputation, generation, and anomaly detection in the time series domain. In this paper, we present a new approach for learning the physics-dependent temporal distribution of multivariate time series data using a weighted physics-informed loss during diffusion model training. A weighted physics-informed loss is constructed using a static weight schedule. This approach enables a diffusion model to accurately approximate underlying data distribution, which can influence the unsupervised anomaly detection performance. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that physics-informed training improves the F1 score in anomaly detection; it generates better data diversity and log-likelihood. Our model outperforms baseline approaches, additionally, it surpasses prior physics-informed work and purely data-driven diffusion models on a synthetic dataset and one real-world dataset while remaining competitive on others.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping science and industry, yet many users still regard its models as opaque "black boxes". Conventional explainable artificial-intelligence methods clarify individual predictions but overlook the upstream decisions and downstream quality checks that determine whether insights can be trusted. In this work, we present Holistic Explainable Artificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embeds explanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors those explanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up, learning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into a single taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts, data analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs; our survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded in theories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction and findings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics that make explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable. A comprehensive taxonomy operationalises these insights, reducing terminological ambiguity and enabling rigorous coverage analysis of existing toolchains. We further demonstrate how AI agents that embed large-language models can orchestrate diverse explanation techniques, translating technical artifacts into stakeholder-specific narratives that bridge the gap between AI developers and domain experts. Departing from traditional surveys or perspective articles, this work melds concepts from multiple disciplines, lessons from real-world projects and a critical synthesis of the literature to advance a novel, end-to-end viewpoint on transparency, trustworthiness and responsible AI deployment.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has emerged as a robust distributed paradigm that circumvents the single-point-of-failure and communication bottleneck risks of centralized architectures. However, a significant challenge arises as existing DFL optimization strategies, primarily designed for tasks such as computer vision, fail to address the unique topological information inherent in the local subgraph. Notably, while Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is tailored for graph data, it is predominantly implemented in a centralized server-client model, failing to leverage the benefits of decentralization.To bridge this gap, we propose DFed-SST, a decentralized federated graph learning framework with adaptive communication. The core of our method is a dual-topology adaptive communication mechanism that leverages the unique topological features of each client's local subgraph to dynamically construct and optimize the inter-client communication topology. This allows our framework to guide model aggregation efficiently in the face of heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of DFed-SST, achieving 3.26% improvement in average accuracy over baseline methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven, nested Operator Inference (OpInf) approach for learning physics-informed reduced-order models (ROMs) from snapshot data of high-dimensional dynamical systems. The approach exploits the inherent hierarchy within the reduced space to iteratively construct initial guesses for the OpInf learning problem that prioritize the interactions of the dominant modes. The initial guess computed for any target reduced dimension corresponds to a ROM with provably smaller or equal snapshot reconstruction error than with standard OpInf. Moreover, our nested OpInf algorithm can be warm-started from previously learned models, enabling versatile application scenarios involving dynamic basis and model form updates. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a cubic heat conduction problem, with nested OpInf achieving a four times smaller error than standard OpInf at a comparable offline time. Further, we apply nested OpInf to a large-scale, parameterized model of the Greenland ice sheet where, despite model form approximation errors, it learns a ROM with, on average, 3% error and computational speed-up factor above 19,000.

Abstract: We introduce SeamlessFlow, a server based reinforcement learning (RL) framework that addresses two core challenges in industrial scale RL: (1) decoupling RL training from the complex execution flow of agents; (2) maximizing GPU utilization with minimal idle time while preserving the stability and scalability required for large-scale deployments. First, SeamlessFlow introduces a data plane that decouples the RL trainer from diverse, complex agent implementations while sustaining high throughput. A central trajectory manager maintains complete interaction histories and supports partial rollout, allowing rollout to pause for weight updates and resume seamlessly, keeping agents unaware of service interruptions. Second, we propose a tag driven scheduling paradigm that abstracts hardware into capability tagged resources, unifying colocated and disaggregated architectures. Based on this, SeamlessFlow introduces a spatiotemporal multiplexing pipeline that dynamically reassigns idle training nodes to rollout in a train rollout separated setup, eliminating pipeline bubbles and fully exploiting heterogeneous cluster resources. By combining these innovations, SeamlessFlow delivers both stability and high performance, making it well suited for multi agent, long horizon, and other complex RL tasks.

Abstract: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects typically involve a diverse array of stakeholders or players from public, private, and regulatory sectors, each with different objectives and responsibilities. Given the complexity, scale, and long-term nature of CCS operations, determining whether individual stakeholders can independently maximize their interests or whether collaborative coalition agreements are needed remains a central question for effective CCS project planning and management. CCS projects are often implemented in geologically connected sites, where shared geological features such as pressure space and reservoir pore capacity can lead to competitive behavior among stakeholders. Furthermore, CO2 storage sites are often located in geologically mature basins that previously served as sites for hydrocarbon extraction or wastewater disposal in order to leverage existing infrastructures, which makes unilateral optimization even more complicated and unrealistic.
  In this work, we propose a paradigm based on Markov games to quantitatively investigate how different coalition structures affect the goals of stakeholders. We frame this multi-stakeholder multi-site problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem with safety constraints. Our approach enables agents to learn optimal strategies while compliant with safety regulations. We present an example where multiple operators are injecting CO2 into their respective project areas in a geologically connected basin. To address the high computational cost of repeated simulations of high-fidelity models, a previously developed surrogate model based on the Embed-to-Control (E2C) framework is employed. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in addressing optimal management of CO2 storage when multiple stakeholders with various objectives and goals are involved.

Abstract: Converging evidence suggests that common complex diseases with the same or similar clinical manifestations could have different underlying genetic etiologies. While current research interests have shifted toward uncovering rare variants and structural variations predisposing to human diseases, the impact of heterogeneity in genetic studies of complex diseases has been largely overlooked. Most of the existing statistical methods assume the disease under investigation has a homogeneous genetic effect and could, therefore, have low power if the disease undergoes heterogeneous pathophysiological and etiological processes. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneity weighted U (HWU) method for association analyses considering genetic heterogeneity. HWU can be applied to various types of phenotypes (e.g., binary and continuous) and is computationally effcient for high- dimensional genetic data. Through simulations, we showed the advantage of HWU when the underlying genetic etiology of a disease was heterogeneous, as well as the robustness of HWU against different model assumptions (e.g., phenotype distributions). Using HWU, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of nicotine dependence from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environments (SAGE) dataset. The genome-wide analysis of nearly one million genetic markers took 7 hours, identifying heterogeneous effects of two new genes (i.e., CYP3A5 and IKBKB) on nicotine dependence.

Abstract: Sequencing-based studies are emerging as a major tool for genetic association studies of complex diseases. These studies pose great challenges to the traditional statistical methods (e.g., single-locus analyses based on regression methods) because of the high-dimensionality of data and the low frequency of genetic variants. In addition, there is a great interest in biology and epidemiology to identify genetic risk factors contributed to multiple disease phenotypes. The multiple phenotypes can often follow different distributions, which violates the assumptions of most current methods. In this paper, we propose a generalized similarity U test, referred to as GSU. GSU is a similarity-based test and can handle high-dimensional genotypes and phenotypes. We studied the theoretical properties of GSU, and provided the efficient p-value calculation for association test as well as the sample size and power calculation for the study design. Through simulation, we found that GSU had advantages over existing methods in terms of power and robustness to phenotype distributions. Finally, we used GSU to perform a multivariate analysis of sequencing data in the Dallas Heart Study and identified a joint association of 4 genes with 5 metabolic related phenotypes.

Abstract: With advancements in next generation sequencing technology, a massive amount of sequencing data are generated, offering a great opportunity to comprehensively investigate the role of rare variants in the genetic etiology of complex diseases. Nevertheless, this poses a great challenge for the statistical analysis of high-dimensional sequencing data. The association analyses based on traditional statistical methods suffer substantial power loss because of the low frequency of genetic variants and the extremely high dimensionality of the data. We developed a weighted U statistic, referred to as WU-seq, for the high-dimensional association analysis of sequencing data. Based on a non-parametric U statistic, WU-SEQ makes no assumption of the underlying disease model and phenotype distribution, and can be applied to a variety of phenotypes. Through simulation studies and an empirical study, we showed that WU-SEQ outperformed a commonly used SKAT method when the underlying assumptions were violated (e.g., the phenotype followed a heavy-tailed distribution). Even when the assumptions were satisfied, WU-SEQ still attained comparable performance to SKAT. Finally, we applied WU-seq to sequencing data from the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), and detected an association between ANGPTL 4 and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol.

<title>Trees Assembling Mann Whitney Approach for Detecting Genome-wide Joint Association among Low Marginal Effect loci</title>

Abstract: Common complex diseases are likely influenced by the interplay of hundreds, or even thousands, of genetic variants. Converging evidence shows that genetic variants with low marginal effects (LME) play an important role in disease development. Despite their potential significance, discovering LME genetic variants and assessing their joint association on high dimensional data (e.g., genome wide association studies) remain a great challenge. To facilitate joint association analysis among a large ensemble of LME genetic variants, we proposed a computationally efficient and powerful approach, which we call Trees Assembling Mann whitney (TAMW). Through simulation studies and an empirical data application, we found that TAMW outperformed multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and the likelihood ratio based Mann whitney approach (LRMW) when the underlying complex disease involves multiple LME loci and their interactions. For instance, in a simulation with 20 interacting LME loci, TAMW attained a higher power (power=0.931) than both MDR (power=0.599) and LRMW (power=0.704). In an empirical study of 29 known Crohn's disease (CD) loci, TAMW also identified a stronger joint association with CD than those detected by MDR and LRMW. Finally, we applied TAMW to Wellcome Trust CD GWAS to conduct a genome wide analysis. The analysis of 459K single nucleotide polymorphisms was completed in 40 hours using parallel computing, and revealed a joint association predisposing to CD (p-value=2.763e-19). Further analysis of the newly discovered association suggested that 13 genes, such as ATG16L1 and LACC1, may play an important role in CD pathophysiological and etiological processes.

Abstract: Second generation sequencing technologies are being increasingly used for genetic association studies, where the main research interest is to identify sets of genetic variants that contribute to various phenotype. The phenotype can be univariate disease status, multivariate responses and even high-dimensional outcomes. Considering the genotype and phenotype as two complex objects, this also poses a general statistical problem of testing association between complex objects. We here proposed a similarity-based test, generalized similarity U (GSU), that can test the association between complex objects. We first studied the theoretical properties of the test in a general setting and then focused on the application of the test to sequencing association studies. Based on theoretical analysis, we proposed to use Laplacian kernel based similarity for GSU to boost power and enhance robustness. Through simulation, we found that GSU did have advantages over existing methods in terms of power and robustness. We further performed a whole genome sequencing (WGS) scan for Alzherimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, identifying three genes, APOE, APOC1 and TOMM40, associated with imaging phenotype. We developed a C++ package for analysis of whole genome sequencing data using GSU. The source codes can be downloaded at https://github.com/changshuaiwei/gsu.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced global weather forecasting, outperforming traditional numerical models in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Nevertheless, extending predictions beyond subseasonal timescales requires the development of deep learning (DL)-based ocean-atmosphere coupled models that can realistically simulate complex oceanic responses to atmospheric forcing. This study presents KIST-Ocean, a DL-based global three-dimensional ocean general circulation model using a U-shaped visual attention adversarial network architecture. KIST-Ocean integrates partial convolution, adversarial training, and transfer learning to address coastal complexity and predictive distribution drift in auto-regressive models. Comprehensive evaluations confirmed the model's robust ocean predictive skill and efficiency. Moreover, it accurately captures realistic ocean response, such as Kelvin and Rossby wave propagation in the tropical Pacific, and vertical motions induced by cyclonic and anticyclonic wind stress, demonstrating its ability to represent key ocean-atmosphere coupling mechanisms underlying climate phenomena, including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. These findings reinforce confidence in DL-based global weather and climate models and their extending DL-based approaches to broader Earth system modeling, offering potential for enhancing climate prediction capabilities.

Abstract: Indigenous communities face ongoing challenges in preserving their cultural heritage, particularly in the face of systemic marginalization and urban development. In Brazil, the Museu Nacional dos Povos Indigenas through the Tainacan platform hosts the country's largest online collection of Indigenous objects and iconographies, providing a critical resource for cultural engagement. Using publicly available data from this repository, we present a data-driven initiative that applies artificial intelligence to enhance accessibility, interpretation, and exploration. We develop two semantic pipelines: a visual pipeline that models image-based similarity and a textual pipeline that captures semantic relationships from item descriptions. These embedding spaces are projected into two dimensions and integrated into an interactive visualization tool we also developed. In addition to similarity-based navigation, users can explore the collection through temporal and geographic lenses, enabling both semantic and contextualized perspectives. The system supports curatorial tasks, aids public engagement, and reveals latent connections within the collection. This work demonstrates how AI can ethically contribute to cultural preservation practices.

Abstract: As the demand for more efficient and adaptive computing grows, nature-inspired architectures offer promising alternatives to conventional electronic designs. Microfluidic platforms, drawing on biological forms and fluid dynamics, present a compelling foundation for low-power, high-resilience computing in environments where electronics are unsuitable. This study explores a hybrid reservoir computing system based on a dragonfly-wing inspired microfluidic chip, which encodes temporal input patterns as fluid interactions within the micro channel network.
  The system operates with three dye-based inlet channels and three camera-monitored detection areas, transforming discrete spatial patterns into dynamic color output signals. These reservoir output signals are then modified and passed to a simple and trainable readout layer for pattern classification. Using a combination of raw reservoir outputs and synthetically generated outputs, we evaluated system performance, system clarity, and data efficiency. The results demonstrate consistent classification accuracies up to $91\%$, even with coarse resolution and limited training data, highlighting the viability of the microfluidic reservoir computing.

Abstract: Identifying risks associated with a company is important to investors and the well-being of the overall financial market. In this study, we build a computational framework to automatically extract company risk factors from news articles. Our newly proposed schema comprises seven distinct aspects, such as supply chain, regulations, and competitions. We sample and annotate 744 news articles and benchmark various machine learning models. While large language models have achieved huge progress in various types of NLP tasks, our experiment shows that zero-shot and few-shot prompting state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g. LLaMA-2) can only achieve moderate to low performances in identifying risk factors. And fine-tuned pre-trained language models are performing better on most of the risk factors. Using this model, we analyze over 277K Bloomberg news articles and demonstrate that identifying risk factors from news could provide extensive insight into the operations of companies and industries.

<title>CleanCTG: A Deep Learning Model for Multi-Artefact Detection and Reconstruction in Cardiotocography</title>

Abstract: Cardiotocography (CTG) is essential for fetal monitoring but is frequently compromised by diverse artefacts which obscure true fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns and can lead to misdiagnosis or delayed intervention. Current deep-learning approaches typically bypass comprehensive noise handling, applying minimal preprocessing or focusing solely on downstream classification, while traditional methods rely on simple interpolation or rule-based filtering that addresses only missing samples and fail to correct complex artefact types. We present CleanCTG, an end-to-end dual-stage model that first identifies multiple artefact types via multi-scale convolution and context-aware cross-attention, then reconstructs corrupted segments through artefact-specific correction branches. Training utilised over 800,000 minutes of physiologically realistic, synthetically corrupted CTGs derived from expert-verified "clean" recordings. On synthetic data, CleanCTG achieved perfect artefact detection (AU-ROC = 1.00) and reduced mean squared error (MSE) on corrupted segments to 2.74 x 10^-4 (clean-segment MSE = 2.40 x 10^-6), outperforming the next best method by more than 60%. External validation on 10,190 minutes of clinician-annotated segments yielded AU-ROC = 0.95 (sensitivity = 83.44%, specificity 94.22%), surpassing six comparator classifiers. Finally, when integrated with the Dawes-Redman system on 933 clinical CTG recordings, denoised traces increased specificity (from 80.70% to 82.70%) and shortened median time to decision by 33%. These findings suggest that explicit artefact removal and signal reconstruction can both maintain diagnostic accuracy and enable shorter monitoring sessions, offering a practical route to more reliable CTG interpretation.

<title>HQ-OV3D: A High Box Quality Open-World 3D Detection Framework based on Diffision Model</title>

Abstract: Traditional closed-set 3D detection frameworks fail to meet the demands of open-world applications like autonomous driving. Existing open-vocabulary 3D detection methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of pseudo-label generation followed by semantic alignment. While vision-language models (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of pseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision, remains commonly neglected.To address this issue, we propose a High Box Quality Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate and refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The framework comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA) Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D can serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also as a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary detection or annotation pipelines.

Abstract: Learning and generating various types of data based on conditional diffusion models has been a research hotspot in recent years. Although conditional diffusion models have made considerable progress in improving acceleration algorithms and enhancing generation quality, the lack of non-asymptotic properties has hindered theoretical research. To address this gap, we focus on a conditional diffusion model within the domains of classification and regression (CARD), which aims to learn the original distribution with given input x (denoted as Y|X). It innovatively integrates a pre-trained model f_{\phi}(x) into the original diffusion model framework, allowing it to precisely capture the original conditional distribution given f (expressed as Y|f_{\phi}(x)). Remarkably, when f_{\phi}(x) performs satisfactorily, Y|f_{\phi}(x) closely approximates Y|X. Theoretically, we deduce the stochastic differential equations of CARD and establish its generalized form predicated on the Fokker-Planck equation, thereby erecting a firm theoretical foundation for analysis. Mainly under the Lipschitz assumptions, we utilize the second-order Wasserstein distance to demonstrate the upper error bound between the original and the generated conditional distributions. Additionally, by appending assumptions such as light-tailedness to the original distribution, we derive the convergence upper bound between the true value analogous to the score function and the corresponding network-estimated value.

Abstract: Potholes on the roads are a serious hazard and maintenance burden. This poses a significant threat to road safety and vehicle longevity, especially on the diverse and under-maintained roads of India. In this paper, we present a complete end-to-end system called iWatchRoad for automated pothole detection, Global Positioning System (GPS) tagging, and real time mapping using OpenStreetMap (OSM). We curated a large, self-annotated dataset of over 7,000 frames captured across various road types, lighting conditions, and weather scenarios unique to Indian environments, leveraging dashcam footage. This dataset is used to fine-tune, Ultralytics You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to perform real time pothole detection, while a custom Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module was employed to extract timestamps directly from video frames. The timestamps are synchronized with GPS logs to geotag each detected potholes accurately. The processed data includes the potholes' details and frames as metadata is stored in a database and visualized via a user friendly web interface using OSM. iWatchRoad not only improves detection accuracy under challenging conditions but also provides government compatible outputs for road assessment and maintenance planning through the metadata visible on the website. Our solution is cost effective, hardware efficient, and scalable, offering a practical tool for urban and rural road management in developing regions, making the system automated. iWatchRoad is available at https://smlab.niser.ac.in/project/iwatchroad

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDMs) have recently gained traction as a viable generative framework for natural language. This can be attributed to its scalability and ease of training compared to other diffusion model paradigms for discrete data, establishing itself as the state-of-the-art non-autoregressive generator for discrete data. Diffusion models, in general, have shown excellent ability to improve the generation quality by leveraging inference-time scaling either by increasing the number of denoising steps or by using external verifiers on top of the outputs of each step to guide the generation. In this work, we propose a verifier-based inference-time scaling method that aids in finding a better candidate generation during the denoising process of the MDM. Our experiments demonstrate the application of MDMs for standard text-style transfer tasks and establish MDMs as a better alternative to autoregressive language models. Additionally, we show that a simple soft-value-based verifier setup for MDMs using off-the-shelf pre-trained embedding models leads to significant gains in generation quality even when used on top of typical classifier-free guidance setups in the existing literature.

Abstract: We propose a Buckley James (BJ) Boost Q learning framework for estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimes under right censored survival data, tailored for longitudinal randomized clinical trial settings. The method integrates accelerated failure time models with iterative boosting techniques, including componentwise least squares and regression trees, within a counterfactual Q learning framework. By directly modeling conditional survival time, BJ Boost Q learning avoids the restrictive proportional hazards assumption and enables unbiased estimation of stage specific Q functions. Grounded in potential outcomes, this framework ensures identifiability of the optimal treatment regime under standard causal assumptions. Compared to Cox based Q learning, which relies on hazard modeling and may suffer from bias under misspecification, our approach provides robust and flexible estimation. Simulation studies and analysis of the ACTG175 HIV trial demonstrate that BJ Boost Q learning yields higher accuracy in treatment decision making, especially in multistage settings where bias can accumulate.

Abstract: A Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach leverages generative AI to enhance personalized learning by directly integrating student feedback into AI-generated solutions. Students critique and modify AI responses using predefined feedback tags, fostering deeper engagement and understanding. This empowers students to actively shape their learning, with AI serving as an adaptive partner. The system uses a tagging technique and prompt engineering to personalize content, informing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant educational material and adjust explanations in real time. This builds on existing research in adaptive learning, demonstrating how student-driven feedback loops can modify AI-generated responses for improved student retention and engagement, particularly in STEM education. Preliminary findings from a study with STEM students indicate improved learning outcomes and confidence compared to traditional AI tools. This work highlights AI's potential to create dynamic, feedback-driven, and personalized learning environments through iterative refinement.

Abstract: While progress has been made in identifying common genetic variants associated with human diseases, for most of common complex diseases, the identified genetic variants only account for a small proportion of heritability. Challenges remain in finding additional unknown genetic variants predisposing to complex diseases. With the advance in next-generation sequencing technologies, sequencing studies have become commonplace in genetic research. The ongoing exome-sequencing and whole-genome-sequencing studies generate a massive amount of sequencing variants and allow researchers to comprehensively investigate their role in human diseases. The discovery of new disease-associated variants can be enhanced by utilizing powerful and computationally efficient statistical methods. In this paper, we propose a functional analysis of variance (FANOVA) method for testing an association of sequence variants in a genomic region with a qualitative trait. The FANOVA has a number of advantages: (1) it tests for a joint effect of gene variants, including both common and rare; (2) it fully utilizes linkage disequilibrium and genetic position information; and (3) allows for either protective or risk-increasing causal variants. Through simulations, we show that FANOVA outperform two popularly used methods - SKAT and a previously proposed method based on functional linear models (FLM), - especially if a sample size of a study is small and/or sequence variants have low to moderate effects. We conduct an empirical study by applying three methods (FANOVA, SKAT and FLM) to sequencing data from Dallas Heart Study. While SKAT and FLM respectively detected ANGPTL 4 and ANGPTL 3 associated with obesity, FANOVA was able to identify both genes associated with obesity.

Abstract: Proton PBS treatment planning for H&amp;N cancers involves numerous conflicting objectives, requiring significant effort from human planners to balance and satisfy multiple clinical goals during planning. To achieve this, experience-demanding objective parameter adjustment and computationally expensive inverse optimization are performed iteratively. Extensive efforts have been made to automatically adjust objective parameters, but the most time-consuming component, i.e., inverse optimization, still relies heavily on theory-driven approaches. We propose a data-driven inverse optimizer and integrate it into a PPO-based automatic treatment planning framework to automatically generate high-quality plans within a clinical acceptable planning time. The inverse optimizer is a L2O method that predicts update steps by learning from the task-specific data distribution. For the first time, we integrate techniques designed for long-context processing, originally developed for LLMs, into a Transformer-based L2O framework to address the scalability issue of existing L2O methods. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop virtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy network, and the dose predictor is used to initialize objective parameters. The inner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable MU values based on objectives refined by the PPO policy network. 97 patients are collected in this study, and compared with L-BFGSB, our L2O-based inverse optimizer improves the effectiveness and efficiency by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively. In conjunction with the PPO-based learned virtual planner, plans generated by our framework within an average of 2.55 hours show improved or comparable OAR sparing with superior target coverage for patients with different prescription dose levels, number of target volumes, beam angles, etc., compared with human-generated plans.

Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) uses quantum dynamics to efficiently process temporal data. In this work, we investigate a QRC framework based on two coupled Kerr nonlinear oscillators, a system well-suited for time-series prediction tasks due to its complex nonlinear interactions and potentially high-dimensional state space. We explore how its performance in time-series prediction depends on key physical parameters: input drive strength, Kerr nonlinearity, and oscillator coupling, and analyze the role of entanglement in improving the reservoir's computational performance, focusing on its effect on predicting non-trivial time series. Using logarithmic negativity to quantify entanglement and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) to evaluate predictive accuracy, our results suggest that entanglement provides a computational advantage on average-up to a threshold in the input frequency-that persists under some levels of dissipation and dephasing. In particular, we find that higher dissipation rates can enhance performance. While the entanglement advantage manifests as improvements in both average and worst-case performance, it does not lead to improvements in the best-case error. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of quantum reservoirs for high performance, efficient quantum machine learning and time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate and scalable cancer diagnosis remains a critical challenge in modern pathology, particularly for malignancies such as breast, prostate, bone, and cervical, which exhibit complex histological variability. In this study, we propose a transformer-based deep learning framework for multi-class tumor classification in histopathological images. Leveraging a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, our method addresses key limitations of conventional convolutional neural networks, offering improved performance, reduced preprocessing requirements, and enhanced scalability across tissue types. To adapt the model for histopathological cancer images, we implement a streamlined preprocessing pipeline that converts tiled whole-slide images into PyTorch tensors and standardizes them through data normalization. This ensures compatibility with the ViT architecture and enhances both convergence stability and overall classification performance. We evaluate our model on four benchmark datasets: ICIAR2018 (breast), SICAPv2 (prostate), UT-Osteosarcoma (bone), and SipakMed (cervical) dataset -- demonstrating consistent outperformance over existing deep learning methods. Our approach achieves classification accuracies of 99.32%, 96.92%, 95.28%, and 96.94% for breast, prostate, bone, and cervical cancers respectively, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores exceeding 99% across all datasets. These results confirm the robustness, generalizability, and clinical potential of transformer-based architectures in digital pathology. Our work represents a significant advancement toward reliable, automated, and interpretable cancer diagnosis systems that can alleviate diagnostic burdens and improve healthcare outcomes.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detectors, while effective on data from one ego camera height, struggle with unseen or out-of-distribution camera heights. Existing methods often rely on Plucker embeddings, image transformations or data augmentation. This paper takes a step towards this understudied problem by first investigating the impact of camera height variations on state-of-the-art (SoTA) Mono3D models. With a systematic analysis on the extended CARLA dataset with multiple camera heights, we observe that depth estimation is a primary factor influencing performance under height variations. We mathematically prove and also empirically observe consistent negative and positive trends in mean depth error of regressed and ground-based depth models, respectively, under camera height changes. To mitigate this, we propose Camera Height Robust Monocular 3D Detector (CHARM3R), which averages both depth estimates within the model. CHARM3R improves generalization to unseen camera heights by more than $45\%$, achieving SoTA performance on the CARLA dataset. Codes and Models at https://github.com/abhi1kumar/CHARM3R

Abstract: Detecting multimodal misinformation on social media remains challenging due to inconsistencies between modalities, changes in temporal patterns, and substantial class imbalance. Many existing methods treat posts independently and fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time and modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for robustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into pseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then processes each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual features are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via intra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal attention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form contextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal evolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a trend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode narrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event level, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To address class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates adaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example mining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments on Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrate its robustness, generalizability, and practical applicability across diverse misinformation scenarios.

<title>A CLIP-based Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) Framework for Pedestrian Re-Identification in Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches. While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: This paper establishes the first polynomial convergence rates for Gaussian kernel ridge regression (KRR) with a fixed hyperparameter in both the uniform and the $L^{2}$-norm. The uniform convergence result closes a gap in the theoretical understanding of KRR with the Gaussian kernel, where no such rates were previously known. In addition, we prove a polynomial $L^{2}$-convergence rate in the case, where the Gaussian kernel's width parameter is fixed. This also contributes to the broader understanding of smooth kernels, for which previously only sub-polynomial $L^{2}$-rates were known in similar settings. Together, these results provide new theoretical justification for the use of Gaussian KRR with fixed hyperparameters in nonparametric regression.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful, improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the visual domain.

Abstract: While deploying large language models on edge devices promises low-latency and privacy-preserving AI services, it is hindered by limited device resources. Although pipeline parallelism facilitates distributed inference, existing approaches often ignore the cold-start latency caused by on-demand model loading. In this paper, we propose a latency-aware scheduling framework that overlaps model loading with computation and communication to minimize total inference latency. Based on device and model parameters, the framework dynamically adjusts layer partitioning and allocation to effectively hide loading time, thereby eliminating as many idle periods as possible. We formulate the problem as a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Program and design an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to optimize model partitioning and device assignment. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces cold-start latency compared to baseline strategies.

Abstract: The integration of wireless communications and Large Language Models (LLMs) is poised to unlock ubiquitous intelligent services, yet deploying them in wireless edge-device collaborative environments presents a critical trade-off between inference quality and end-to-end latency. A fundamental mismatch exists between task complexity and resource allocation: offloading simple queries invites prohibitive latency, while on-device models lack the capacity for demanding computations. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic, quality-latency aware routing framework that orchestrates inference between a lightweight model on the mobile device and a powerful model on the edge server. Our framework employs two distinct cost models: for single-turn queries, it fuses a BERT-predicted semantic score with communication and computation overheads; for multi-turn dialogues, it further quantifies context-aware costs arising from model switching and KV-cache management. While maintaining full inference quality, extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework cuts average response latency by 5-15% and reduces large model invocations by 10-20% against competitive baselines on MMLU, GSM8K, and MT-Bench-101 benchmarks.

Abstract: This article explores novel data-driven modeling approaches for analyzing and approximating the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), a physiologically-based metric integrating multiple atmospheric variables to assess thermal comfort. Given the nonlinear, multivariate structure of UTCI, we investigate symbolic and sparse regression techniques as tools for interpretable and efficient function approximation. In particular, we highlight the benefits of using orthogonal polynomial bases-such as Legendre polynomials-in sparse regression frameworks, demonstrating their advantages in stability, convergence, and hierarchical interpretability compared to standard polynomial expansions. We demonstrate that our models achieve significantly lower root-mean squared losses than the widely used sixth-degree polynomial benchmark-while using the same or fewer parameters. By leveraging Legendre polynomial bases, we construct models that efficiently populate a Pareto front of accuracy versus complexity and exhibit stable, hierarchical coefficient structures across varying model capacities. Training on just 20% of the data, our models generalize robustly to the remaining 80%, with consistent performance under bootstrapping. The decomposition effectively approximates the UTCI as a Fourier-like expansion in an orthogonal basis, yielding results near the theoretical optimum in the L2 (least squares) sense. We also connect these findings to the broader context of equation discovery in environmental modeling, referencing probabilistic grammar-based methods that enforce domain consistency and compactness in symbolic expressions. Taken together, these results illustrate how combining sparsity, orthogonality, and symbolic structure enables robust, interpretable modeling of complex environmental indices like UTCI - and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approximation in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: The impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on methamphetamine (METH) users' craving levels is often assessed using questionnaires. This study explores the feasibility of using neural signals to obtain more objective results. EEG signals recorded from 20 METH-addicted participants Before and After rTMS (MBT and MAT) and from 20 healthy participants (HC) are analyzed. In each EEG paradigm, participants are shown 15 METH-related and 15 neutral pictures randomly, and the relative band power (RBP) of each EEG sub-band frequency is derived. The average RBP across all 31 channels, as well as individual brain regions, is analyzed. Statistically, MAT's alpha, beta, and gamma RBPs are more like those of HC compared to MBT, as indicated by the power topographies. Utilizing a random forest (RF), the gamma RBP is identified as the optimal frequency band for distinguishing between MBT and HC with a 90% accuracy. The performance of classifying MAT versus HC is lower than that of MBT versus HC, suggesting that the efficacy of rTMS can be validated using RF with gamma RBP. Furthermore, the gamma RBP recorded by the TP10 and CP2 channels dominates the classification task of MBT versus HC when receiving METH-related image cues. The gamma RBP during exposure to METH-related cues can serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between MBT and HC and for evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS. Therefore, real-time monitoring of gamma RBP variations holds promise as a parameter for implementing a customized closed-loop neuromodulation system for treating METH addiction.

Abstract: In targeted adversarial attacks on vision models, the selection of the target label is a critical yet often overlooked determinant of attack success. This target label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model to predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model predictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability, reproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided framework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge transfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity sources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect to the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our experiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these models consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static lexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class relationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \textit{a priori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models for constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial benchmarks across architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods aim to represent entities and relations in a low-dimensional space, primarily focusing on static graphs. However, real-world KGs are dynamically evolving with the constant addition of entities, relations and facts. To address such dynamic nature of KGs, several continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) methods have been developed to efficiently update KG embeddings to accommodate new facts while maintaining learned knowledge. As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world scenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of updates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In this paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for CKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on the update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly. The Dynamic Distillation mechanism is further employed to balance the preservation of learned knowledge and the incorporation of new facts. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmarks, and the results show that SAGE consistently outperforms existing baselines, with a notable improvement of 1.38% in MRR, 1.25% in H@1 and 1.6% in H@10. Furthermore, experiments comparing SAGE with methods using fixed embedding dimensions show that SAGE achieves optimal performance on every snapshot, demonstrating the importance of adaptive embedding dimensions in CKGE. The codes of SAGE are publicly available at: https://github.com/lyfxjtu/Dynamic-Embedding.

Abstract: RETFound is a well-known foundation model (FM) developed for fundus camera and optical coherence tomography images. It has shown promising performance across multiple datasets in diagnosing diseases, both eye-specific and systemic, from retinal images. However, to our best knowledge, it has not been used for other tasks. We present the first adaptation of RETFound for optic disc segmentation, a ubiquitous and foundational task in retinal image analysis. The resulting segmentation system outperforms state-of-the-art, segmentation-specific baseline networks after training a head with only a very modest number of task-specific examples. We report and discuss results with four public datasets, IDRID, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, and a private dataset, GoDARTS, achieving about 96% Dice consistently across all datasets. Overall, our method obtains excellent performance in internal verification, domain generalization and domain adaptation, and exceeds most of the state-of-the-art baseline results. We discuss the results in the framework of the debate about FMs as alternatives to task-specific architectures. The code is available at: [link to be added after the paper is accepted]

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation is crucial for optimizing face recognition models for deployment in computationally limited settings, such as edge devices. Traditional KD methods, such as Raw L2 Feature Distillation or Feature Consistency loss, often fail to capture both fine-grained instance-level details and complex relational structures, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose a unified approach that integrates two novel loss functions, Instance-Level Embedding Distillation and Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity Distillation. Instance-Level Embedding Distillation focuses on aligning individual feature embeddings by leveraging a dynamic hard mining strategy, thereby enhancing learning from challenging examples. Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity Distillation captures relational information through pairwise similarity relationships, employing a memory bank mechanism and a sample mining strategy. This unified framework ensures both effective instance-level alignment and preservation of geometric relationships between samples, leading to a more comprehensive distillation process. Our unified framework outperforms state-of-the-art distillation methods across multiple benchmark face recognition datasets, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations. Interestingly, when using strong teacher networks compared to the student, our unified KD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's accuracy.

Abstract: Concurrent to the rapid progress in the development of neural-network based models in areas like natural language processing and computer vision, the need for creating explanations for the predictions of these black-box models has risen steadily. We propose a new method to generate extractive explanations for predictions made by neural networks, that is based on masking parts of the input which the model does not consider to be indicative of the respective class. The masking is done using gradient-based optimization combined with a new regularization scheme that enforces sufficiency, comprehensiveness and compactness of the generated explanation, three properties that are known to be desirable from the related field of rationale extraction in natural language processing. In this way, we bridge the gap between model interpretability and rationale extraction, thereby proving that the latter of which can be performed without training a specialized model, only on the basis of a trained classifier. We further apply the same method to image inputs and obtain high quality explanations for image classifications, which indicates that the conditions proposed for rationale extraction in natural language processing are more broadly applicable to different input types.

Abstract: We propose an end-to-end differentiable training paradigm for stable training of a rationalized transformer classifier. Our approach results in a single model that simultaneously classifies a sample and scores input tokens based on their relevance to the classification. To this end, we build on the widely-used three-player-game for training rationalized models, which typically relies on training a rationale selector, a classifier and a complement classifier. We simplify this approach by making a single model fulfill all three roles, leading to a more efficient training paradigm that is not susceptible to the common training instabilities that plague existing approaches. Further, we extend this paradigm to produce class-wise rationales while incorporating recent advances in parameterizing and regularizing the resulting rationales, thus leading to substantially improved and state-of-the-art alignment with human annotations without any explicit supervision.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have become the go-to method for biomedical instance segmentation. Generalist models like Cellpose demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse cellular data, though their effectiveness often degrades on domains that differ from their training data. While supervised fine-tuning can address this limitation, it requires annotated data that may not be readily available. We propose SelfAdapt, a method that enables the adaptation of pre-trained cell segmentation models without the need for labels. Our approach builds upon student-teacher augmentation consistency training, introducing L2-SP regularization and label-free stopping criteria. We evaluate our method on the LiveCell and TissueNet datasets, demonstrating relative improvements in AP0.5 of up to 29.64% over baseline Cellpose. Additionally, we show that our unsupervised adaptation can further improve models that were previously fine-tuned with supervision. We release SelfAdapt as an easy-to-use extension of the Cellpose framework. The code for our method is publicly available at https: //github.com/Kainmueller-Lab/self_adapt.

Abstract: Insider threat detection aims to identify malicious user behavior by analyzing logs that record user interactions. Due to the lack of fine-grained behavior-level annotations, detecting specific behavior-level anomalies within user behavior sequences is challenging. Unsupervised methods face high false positive rates and miss rates due to the inherent ambiguity between normal and anomalous behaviors. In this work, we instead introduce weak labels of behavior sequences, which have lower annotation costs, i.e., the training labels (anomalous or normal) are at sequence-level instead of behavior-level, to enhance the detection capability for behavior-level anomalies by learning discriminative features. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called Robust Multi-sphere Learning (RMSL). RMSL uses multiple hyper-spheres to represent the normal patterns of behaviors. Initially, a one-class classifier is constructed as a good anomaly-supervision-free starting point. Building on this, using multiple instance learning and adaptive behavior-level self-training debiasing based on model prediction confidence, the framework further refines hyper-spheres and feature representations using weak sequence-level labels. This approach enhances the model's ability to distinguish between normal and anomalous behaviors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMSL significantly improves the performance of behavior-level insider threat detection.

Abstract: Historical handwritten text recognition (HTR) is essential for unlocking the cultural and scholarly value of archival documents, yet digitization is often hindered by scarce transcriptions, linguistic variation, and highly diverse handwriting styles. In this study, we apply TrOCR, a state-of-the-art transformer-based HTR model, to 16th-century Latin manuscripts authored by Rudolf Gwalther. We investigate targeted image preprocessing and a broad suite of data augmentation techniques, introducing four novel augmentation methods designed specifically for historical handwriting characteristics. We also evaluate ensemble learning approaches to leverage the complementary strengths of augmentation-trained models. On the Gwalther dataset, our best single-model augmentation (Elastic) achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.86, while a top-5 voting ensemble achieves a CER of 1.60 - representing a 50% relative improvement over the best reported TrOCR_BASE result and a 42% improvement over the previous state of the art. These results highlight the impact of domain-specific augmentations and ensemble strategies in advancing HTR performance for historical manuscripts.

Abstract: Reliable autonomous navigation across the unstructured terrains of distant planetary surfaces is a critical enabler for future space exploration. However, the deployment of learning-based controllers is hindered by the inherent sim-to-real gap, particularly for the complex dynamics of wheel interactions with granular media. This work presents a complete sim-to-real framework for developing and validating robust control policies for dynamic waypoint tracking on such challenging surfaces. We leverage massively parallel simulation to train reinforcement learning agents across a vast distribution of procedurally generated environments with randomized physics. These policies are then transferred zero-shot to a physical wheeled rover operating in a lunar-analogue facility. Our experiments systematically compare multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and action smoothing filters to identify the most effective combinations for real-world deployment. Crucially, we provide strong empirical evidence that agents trained with procedural diversity achieve superior zero-shot performance compared to those trained on static scenarios. We also analyze the trade-offs of fine-tuning with high-fidelity particle physics, which offers minor gains in low-speed precision at a significant computational cost. Together, these contributions establish a validated workflow for creating reliable learning-based navigation systems, marking a critical step towards deploying autonomous robots in the final frontier.

Abstract: Deep Learning has emerged as a promising approach for skin lesion analysis. However, existing methods mostly rely on fully supervised learning, requiring extensive labeled data, which is challenging and costly to obtain. To alleviate this annotation burden, this study introduces a novel semi-supervised deep learning approach that integrates ensemble learning with online knowledge distillation for enhanced skin lesion classification. Our methodology involves training an ensemble of convolutional neural network models, using online knowledge distillation to transfer insights from the ensemble to its members. This process aims to enhance the performance of each model within the ensemble, thereby elevating the overall performance of the ensemble itself. Post-training, any individual model within the ensemble can be deployed at test time, as each member is trained to deliver comparable performance to the ensemble. This is particularly beneficial in resource-constrained environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the knowledge-distilled individual model performs better than independently trained models. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on both the \emph{International Skin Imaging Collaboration} 2018 and 2019 public benchmark datasets, surpassing current state-of-the-art results. By leveraging ensemble learning and online knowledge distillation, our method reduces the need for extensive labeled data while providing a more resource-efficient solution for skin lesion classification in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting clinical diagnosis. However, achieving efficient and high-accuracy image classification in resource-constrained computational environments remains challenging. This study proposes a medical image classification method based on an improved ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture. Through structural optimization and loss function design, the proposed method enhances feature extraction capability and classification performance while reducing computational complexity. Specifically, the method introduces a dual global pooling (Global Average Pooling and Global Max Pooling) feature fusion strategy into the ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to simultaneously preserve global statistical features and salient response information. A lightweight channel attention module, termed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve the adaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead. Additionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss function to enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance. Under CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximum classification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs, exhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves medical image classification performance in resource-limited settings, providing a feasible and efficient solution for the deployment and promotion of medical imaging analysis models.

Abstract: Determining the optimal data mixture for large language model training remains a challenging problem with an outsized impact on performance. In practice, language model developers continue to rely on heuristic exploration since no learning-based approach has emerged as a reliable solution. In this work, we propose to view the selection of training data mixtures as a black-box hyperparameter optimization problem, for which Bayesian Optimization is a well-established class of appropriate algorithms. Firstly, we cast data mixture learning as a sequential decision-making problem, in which we aim to find a suitable trade-off between the computational cost of training exploratory (proxy-) models and final mixture performance. Secondly, we systematically explore the properties of transferring mixtures learned at a small scale to larger-scale experiments, providing insights and highlighting opportunities for research at a modest scale. By proposing Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization as a suitable method in this common scenario, we introduce a natural framework to balance experiment cost with model fit, avoiding the risks of overfitting to smaller scales while minimizing the number of experiments at high cost. We present results for pre-training and instruction finetuning across models ranging from 1 million to 7 billion parameters, varying from simple architectures to state-of-the-art models and benchmarks spanning dozens of datasets. We demonstrate consistently strong results relative to a wide range of benchmarks, showingspeed-ups of over 500% in determining the best data mixture on our largest experiments relative to recent baselines. In addition, we broaden access to research by sharing ADMIRE IFT Runs, a dataset of 460 full training & evaluation runs across various model sizes worth over 13,000 GPU hours, greatly reducing the cost of conducting research in this area.

Abstract: Deploying multiple machine learning models on resource-constrained robotic platforms for different perception tasks often results in redundant computations, large memory footprints, and complex integration challenges. In response, this work presents Visual Perception Engine (VPEngine), a modular framework designed to enable efficient GPU usage for visual multitasking while maintaining extensibility and developer accessibility. Our framework architecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image representations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU memory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared to sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine offers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint while allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during runtime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++ (Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse robotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time performance at $\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized models.

Abstract: Effective and efficient agricultural manipulation and harvesting depend on accurately understanding the current state of the grasp. The agricultural environment presents unique challenges due to its complexity, clutter, and occlusion. Additionally, fruit is physically attached to the plant, requiring precise separation during harvesting. Selecting appropriate sensors and modeling techniques is critical for obtaining reliable feedback and correctly identifying grasp states. This work investigates a set of key sensors, namely inertial measurement units (IMUs), infrared (IR) reflectance, tension, tactile sensors, and RGB cameras, integrated into a compliant gripper to classify grasp states. We evaluate the individual contribution of each sensor and compare the performance of two widely used classification models: Random Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our results demonstrate that a Random Forest classifier, trained in a controlled lab environment and tested on real cherry tomato plants, achieved 100% accuracy in identifying slip, grasp failure, and successful picks, marking a substantial improvement over baseline performance. Furthermore, we identify a minimal viable sensor combination, namely IMU and tension sensors that effectively classifies grasp states. This classifier enables the planning of corrective actions based on real-time feedback, thereby enhancing the efficiency and reliability of fruit harvesting operations.

<title>Nonparametric learning of stochastic differential equations from sparse and noisy data</title>

arXiv:2508.11597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper proposes a systematic framework for building data-driven stochastic differential equation (SDE) models from sparse, noisy observations. Unlike traditional parametric approaches, which assume a known functional form for the drift, our goal here is to learn the entire drift function directly from data without strong structural assumptions, making it especially relevant in scientific disciplines where system dynamics are partially understood or highly complex. We cast the estimation problem as minimization of the penalized negative log-likelihood functional over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In the sparse observation regime, the presence of unobserved trajectory segments makes the SDE likelihood intractable. To address this, we develop an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that employs a novel Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method to approximate the filtering distribution and generate Monte Carlo estimates of the E-step objective. The M-step then reduces to a penalized empirical risk minimization problem in the RKHS, whose minimizer is given by a finite linear combination of kernel functions via a generalized representer theorem. To control model complexity across EM iterations, we also develop a hybrid Bayesian variant of the algorithm that uses shrinkage priors to identify significant coefficients in the kernel expansion. We establish important theoretical convergence results for both the exact and approximate EM sequences. The resulting EM-SMC-RKHS procedure enables accurate estimation of the drift function of stochastic dynamical systems in low-data regimes and is broadly applicable across domains requiring continuous-time modeling under observational constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a series of numerical experiments.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it is becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation methods.

<title>Enabling Differentially Private Federated Learning for Speech Recognition: Benchmarks, Adaptive Optimizers and Gradient Clipping</title>

Abstract: While federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) have been extensively studied, their application to automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains largely unexplored due to the challenges in training large transformer models. Specifically, large models further exacerbate issues in FL as they are particularly susceptible to gradient heterogeneity across layers, unlike the relatively uniform gradient behavior observed in shallow models. As a result, prior works struggle to converge with standard optimization techniques, even in the absence of DP mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work establishes a competitive, practical recipe for FL with DP in the context of ASR. To address this gap, we establish \textbf{the first benchmark for FL with DP in end-to-end ASR}. Our approach centers on per-layer clipping and layer-wise gradient normalization: theoretical analysis reveals that these techniques together mitigate clipping bias and gradient heterogeneity across layers in deeper models. Consistent with these theoretical insights, our empirical results show that FL with DP is viable under strong privacy guarantees, provided a population of at least several million users. Specifically, we achieve user-level (7.2, $10^{-9}$)-DP (resp. (4.5, $10^{-9}$)-DP) with only a 1.3% (resp. 4.6%) absolute drop in word error rate when extrapolating to high (resp. low) population scales for FL with DP in ASR. Although our experiments focus on ASR, the underlying principles we uncover - particularly those concerning gradient heterogeneity and layer-wise gradient normalization - offer broader guidance for designing scalable, privacy-preserving FL algorithms for large models across domains. Code of all experiments and benchmarks is available at https://github.com/apple/ml-pfl4asr.

<title>JMA: a General Algorithm to Craft Nearly Optimal Targeted Adversarial Example</title>

Abstract: Most of the approaches proposed so far to craft targeted adversarial examples against Deep Learning classifiers are highly suboptimal and typically rely on increasing the likelihood of the target class, thus implicitly focusing on one-hot encoding settings. In this paper, a more general, theoretically sound, targeted attack is proposed, which resorts to the minimization of a Jacobian-induced Mahalanobis distance term, taking into account the effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of the input sample in a given direction. The minimization is solved by exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm (referred to as JMA) provides an optimal solution to a linearised version of the adversarial example problem originally introduced by Szegedy et al. The results of the experiments confirm the generality of the proposed attack which is proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes. Noticeably, JMA is also effective in a multi-label classification scenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the labels in complex multi-label classification scenarios, a capability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far. As a further advantage, JMA requires very few iterations, thus resulting more efficient than existing methods.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of distribution shifts on non-homophilous graphs Mosting existing graph neural network methods rely on the homophilous assumption that nodes from the same class are more likely to be linked. However, such assumptions of homophily do not always hold in real-world graphs, which leads to more complex distribution shifts unaccounted for in previous methods. The distribution shifts of neighborhood patterns are much more diverse on non-homophilous graphs. We propose a novel Invariant Neighborhood Pattern Learning (INPL) to alleviate the distribution shifts problem on non-homophilous graphs. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive Neighborhood Propagation (ANP) module to capture the adaptive neighborhood information, which could alleviate the neighborhood pattern distribution shifts problem on non-homophilous graphs. We propose Invariant Non-Homophilous Graph Learning (INHGL) module to constrain the ANP and learn invariant graph representation on non-homophilous graphs. Extensive experimental results on real-world non-homophilous graphs show that INPL could achieve state-of-the-art performance for learning on large non-homophilous graphs.

<title>A Spectral Framework for Evaluating Geodesic Distances Between Graphs</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a spectral framework for quantifying the differentiation between graph data samples by introducing a novel metric named Graph Geodesic Distance (GGD). For two different graphs with the same number of nodes, our framework leverages a spectral graph matching procedure to find node correspondence so that the geodesic distance between them can be subsequently computed by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem associated with their Laplacian matrices. For graphs of different sizes, a resistance-based spectral graph coarsening scheme is introduced to reduce the size of the larger graph while preserving the original spectral properties. We show that the proposed GGD metric can effectively quantify dissimilarities between two graphs by encapsulating their differences in key structural (spectral) properties, such as effective resistances between nodes, cuts, and the mixing time of random walks. Through extensive experiments comparing with state-of-the-art metrics, such as the latest Tree-Mover's Distance (TMD), the proposed GGD metric demonstrates significantly improved performance for graph classification, particularly when only partial node features are available. Furthermore, we extend the application of GGD beyond graph classification to stability analysis of GNNs and the quantification of distances between datasets, highlighting its versatility in broader machine learning contexts.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have seen great success in scientific domains thanks to spline activation functions, becoming an alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, spline functions may not respect symmetry in tasks, which is crucial prior knowledge in machine learning. In this paper, we propose Equivariant Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (EKAN), a method for incorporating arbitrary matrix group equivariance into KANs, aiming to broaden their applicability to more fields. We first construct gated spline basis functions, which form the EKAN layer together with equivariant linear weights, and then define a lift layer to align the input space of EKAN with the feature space of the dataset, thereby building the entire EKAN architecture. Compared with baseline models, EKAN achieves higher accuracy with smaller datasets or fewer parameters on symmetry-related tasks, such as particle scattering and the three-body problem, often reducing test MSE by several orders of magnitude. Even in non-symbolic formula scenarios, such as top quark tagging with three jet constituents, EKAN achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art equivariant architectures using fewer than 40% of the parameters, while KANs do not outperform MLPs as expected. Code and data are available at https://github.com/hulx2002/EKAN .

Abstract: Recent methods aim to merge neural networks (NNs) with identical architectures trained on different tasks into a single multi-task model. While most works focus on the simpler setup of merging NNs initialized from a common pre-trained network, we target the harder problem of merging large transformers trained on different tasks from distinct initializations. We show that traditional merging methods fail catastrophically in this setup, while Knowledge Distillation (KD) achieves much better results, though at a higher cost. However, KD is data-inefficient, as it does not exploit the original models' weights. To solve this, we introduce "Foldable SuperNet Merge" (FS-Merge), which trains a SuperNet containing the original models (with frozen weights) using a feature reconstruction objective. After training, the SuperNet is folded back to the size of a single original model. FS-Merge is simple, data-efficient, has a computational cost comparable to KD, and is proven to have superior expressiveness compared to traditional merging methods on MLP models. It achieves SOTA results when tested on MLPs and transformers across various sizes, tasks, modalities, and distribution shifts, especially in low-data scenarios.

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse suggests actions to individuals who have been adversely affected by automated decision-making, helping them to achieve the desired outcome. Knowing the recourse, however, does not guarantee that users can implement it perfectly, either due to environmental variability or personal choices. Recourse generation should thus anticipate its sub-optimal or noisy implementation. While several approaches construct recourse that is robust to small perturbations -- e.g., arising due to its noisy implementation -- they assume that the entire recourse is implemented in a single step, thus model the noise as one-off and uniform. But these assumptions are unrealistic since recourse often entails multiple sequential steps, which makes it harder to implement and subject to increasing noise. In this work, we consider recourse under plausible noise that adheres to the local data geometry and accumulates at every step of the way. We frame this problem as a Markov Decision Process and demonstrate that such a distribution of plausible noise satisfies the Markov property. We then propose the RObust SEquential (ROSE) recourse generator for tabular data; our method produces a series of steps leading to the desired outcome even when they are implemented imperfectly. Given plausible modelling of sub-optimal human actions and greater recourse robustness to accumulated uncertainty, ROSE provides users with a high chance of success while maintaining low recourse cost. Empirical evaluation shows that our algorithm effectively navigates the inherent trade-off between recourse robustness and cost while ensuring its sparsity and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Conventional model compression techniques for LLMs address high memory consumption and slow inference challenges but typically require computationally expensive retraining to preserve accuracy. In contrast, one-shot compression methods eliminate retraining cost, but struggle to achieve accuracy comparable to dense models. This paper presents SLIM, a new one-shot compression framework that holistically integrates hardware-friendly quantization, sparsity, and low-rank approximation into a unified process. First, we formulate the quantization process using a probabilistic approach (SLIM-Quant) that enables us to apply uniform quantization. Then, we use an existing one-shot pruning method to apply semi-structured sparsity on top of the quantized weights. Finally, to compensate for the introduced aggregated quantization and sparsity error, we use a novel saliency function with unique invertible and additive features that enables us to mathematically compute the value of low-rank adapters. SLIM improves model accuracy by up to 5.66% (LLaMA-2-7B) for 2:4 sparsity with 4-bit weight quantization, outperforming prior methods. Models compressed with SLIM achieve up to 4.3x and 3.8x on Nvidia RTX3060 and A100 GPUs, respectively. Additionally, they achieve up to 0.23x end-to-end memory reduction in comparison to their dense counterparts. We also propose an optional PEFT recipe that further improves accuracy by up to 1.66% (LLaMA-2-13B) compared to SLIM without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Data augmentation that introduces diversity into the input data has long been used in training deep learning models. It has demonstrated benefits in improving robustness and generalization, practically aligning well with other regularization strategies such as dropout and weight decay. However, the underlying mechanism of how diverse training data contributes to model improvements remains unknown. In this paper, we investigate the impact of data diversity on the weight space of deep neural networks using Random Matrix Theory. Through spectral analysis and comparing models trained with data augmentation, dropout, and weight decay, we reveal that increasing data diversity alters the weight spectral distribution similarly to other regularization techniques, while displaying a pattern more closely aligned with dropout than with weight decay. Building on these insights, we propose a metric to explain and compare the benefits of diversity introduced by traditional data augmentations and those achieved through synthetic data.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can solve diverse tasks but often exhibit unsafe behavior. Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) address this by enforcing safety constraints, yet existing methods either sacrifice reward maximization or allow unsafe training. We introduce Constrained Trust Region Policy Optimization (C-TRPO), which reshapes the policy space geometry to ensure trust regions contain only safe policies, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction throughout training. We analyze its theoretical properties and connections to TRPO, Natural Policy Gradient (NPG), and Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO). Experiments show that C-TRPO reduces constraint violations while maintaining competitive returns.

<title>Learning-based Sketches for Frequency Estimation in Data Streams without Ground Truth</title>

Abstract: Estimating the frequency of items on the high-volume, fast data stream has been extensively studied in many areas, such as database and network measurement. Traditional sketches provide only coarse estimates under strict memory constraints. Although some learning-augmented methods have emerged recently, they typically rely on offline training with real frequencies or/and labels, which are often unavailable. Moreover, these methods suffer from slow update speeds, limiting their suitability for real-time processing despite offering only marginal accuracy improvements. To overcome these challenges, we propose UCL-sketch, a practical learning-based paradigm for per-key frequency estimation. Our design introduces two key innovations: (i) an online training mechanism based on equivalent learning that requires no ground truth (GT), and (ii) a highly scalable architecture leveraging logically structured estimation buckets to scale to real-world data stream. The UCL-sketch, which utilizes compressive sensing (CS), converges to an estimator that provably yields a error bound far lower than that of prior works, without sacrificing the speed of processing. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms previously proposed approaches regarding per-key accuracy and distribution. Notably, under extremely tight memory budgets, its quality almost matches that of an (infeasible) omniscient oracle. Moreover, compared to the existing equation-based sketch, UCL-sketch achieves an average decoding speedup of nearly 500 times. To help further research and development, our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Y-debug-sys/UCL-sketch.

Abstract: In the peer review process of top-tier machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) conferences, reviewers are assigned to papers through automated methods. These assignment algorithms consider two main factors: (1) reviewers' expressed interests indicated by their bids for papers, and (2) reviewers' domain expertise inferred from the similarity between the text of their previously published papers and the submitted manuscripts. A significant challenge these conferences face is the existence of collusion rings, where groups of researchers manipulate the assignment process to review each other's papers, providing positive evaluations regardless of their actual quality. Most efforts to combat collusion rings have focused on preventing bid manipulation, under the assumption that the text similarity component is secure. In this paper, we demonstrate that even in the absence of bidding, colluding reviewers and authors can exploit the machine learning based text-matching component of reviewer assignment used at top ML/AI venues to get assigned their target paper. We also highlight specific vulnerabilities within this system and offer suggestions to enhance its robustness.

Abstract: Many important scientific problems involve multivariate optimization coupled with slow and laborious experimental measurements. These complex, high-dimensional searches can be defined by non-convex optimization landscapes that resemble needle-in-a-haystack surfaces, leading to entrapment in local minima. Contextualizing optimizers with human domain knowledge is a powerful approach to guide searches to localized fruitful regions. However, this approach is susceptible to human confirmation bias and it is also challenging for domain experts to keep track of the rapidly expanding scientific literature. Here, we propose the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for contextualizing Bayesian optimization (BO) via a hybrid optimization framework that intelligently and economically blends stochastic inference with domain knowledge-based insights from the LLM, which is used to suggest new, better-performing areas of the search space for exploration. Our method fosters user engagement by offering real-time commentary on the optimization progress, explaining the reasoning behind the search strategies. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic benchmarks with up to 15 independent variables and demonstrate the ability of LLMs to reason in four real-world experimental tasks where context-aware suggestions boost optimization performance substantially.

Abstract: Identification of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) helps derive cellular mechanistic understanding, particularly in the context of complex conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndromes, and cancer. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in predicting protein structures and interactions via automated mining of vast biomedical literature; yet their inherent uncertainty remains a key challenge for deriving reproducible findings, critical for biomedical applications. In this study, we present an uncertainty-aware adaptation of LLMs for PPI analysis, leveraging fine-tuned LLaMA-3 and BioMedGPT models. To enhance prediction reliability, we integrate LoRA ensembles and Bayesian LoRA models for uncertainty quantification (UQ), ensuring confidence-calibrated insights into protein behavior. Our approach achieves competitive performance in PPI identification across diverse disease contexts while addressing model uncertainty, thereby enhancing trustworthiness and reproducibility in computational biology. These findings underscore the potential of uncertainty-aware LLM adaptation for advancing precision medicine and biomedical research.

Abstract: Diffusion Models~(DMs) have emerged as the dominant approach in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), owing to their remarkable performance in tasks such as text-to-image synthesis. However, practical DMs, such as stable diffusion, are typically trained on massive datasets and thus usually require large storage. At the same time, many steps may be required, i.e., recursively evaluating the trained neural network, to generate a high-quality image, which results in significant computational costs during sample generation. As a result, distillation methods on pre-trained DM have become widely adopted practices to develop smaller, more efficient models capable of rapid, few-step generation in low-resource environment. When these distillation methods are developed from different perspectives, there is an urgent need for a systematic survey, particularly from a methodological perspective. In this survey, we review distillation methods through three aspects: output loss distillation, trajectory distillation and adversarial distillation. We also discuss current challenges and outline future research directions in the conclusion.

<title>An Analytical Theory of Spectral Bias in the Learning Dynamics of Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: We develop an analytical framework for understanding how the generated distribution evolves during diffusion model training. Leveraging a Gaussian-equivalence principle, we solve the full-batch gradient-flow dynamics of linear and convolutional denoisers and integrate the resulting probability-flow ODE, yielding analytic expressions for the generated distribution. The theory exposes a universal inverse-variance spectral law: the time for an eigen- or Fourier mode to match its target variance scales as $\tau\propto\lambda^{-1}$, so high-variance (coarse) structure is mastered orders of magnitude sooner than low-variance (fine) detail. Extending the analysis to deep linear networks and circulant full-width convolutions shows that weight sharing merely multiplies learning rates accelerating but not eliminating the bias whereas local convolution introduces a qualitatively different bias. Experiments on Gaussian and natural-image datasets confirm the spectral law persists in deep MLP-based UNet. Convolutional U-Nets, however, display rapid near-simultaneous emergence of many modes, implicating local convolution in reshaping learning dynamics. These results underscore how data covariance governs the order and speed with which diffusion models learn, and they call for deeper investigation of the unique inductive biases introduced by local convolution.

<title>SAND: One-Shot Feature Selection with Additive Noise Distortion</title>

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in data-driven applications, reducing input dimensionality to enhance learning accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Existing state-of-the-art methods often require post-selection retraining and extensive hyperparameter tuning, complicating their adoption. We introduce a novel, non-intrusive feature selection layer that, given a target feature count $k$, automatically identifies and selects the $k$ most informative features during neural network training. Our method is uniquely simple, requiring no alterations to the loss function, network architecture, or post-selection retraining. The layer is mathematically elegant and can be fully described by: \begin{align} \nonumber \tilde{x}_i = a_i x_i + (1-a_i)z_i \end{align} where $x_i$ is the input feature, $\tilde{x}_i$ the output, $z_i$ a Gaussian noise, and $a_i$ trainable gain such that $\sum_i{a_i^2}=k$. This formulation induces an automatic clustering effect, driving $k$ of the $a_i$ gains to $1$ (selecting informative features) and the rest to $0$ (discarding redundant ones) via weighted noise distortion and gain normalization. Despite its extreme simplicity, our method delivers state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark datasets and a novel real-world dataset, outperforming or matching existing approaches without requiring hyperparameter search for $k$ or retraining. Theoretical analysis in the context of linear regression further validates its efficacy. Our work demonstrates that simplicity and performance are not mutually exclusive, offering a powerful yet straightforward tool for feature selection in machine learning.

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) extend standard VAEs by replacing the fully factorised Gaussian prior with a GP prior, thereby capturing richer correlations among latent variables. However, performing exact GP inference in large-scale GPVAEs is computationally prohibitive, often forcing existing approaches to rely on restrictive kernel assumptions or large sets of inducing points. In this work, we propose a neighbour-driven approximation strategy that exploits local adjacencies in the latent space to achieve scalable GPVAE inference. By confining computations to the nearest neighbours of each data point, our method preserves essential latent dependencies, allowing more flexible kernel choices and mitigating the need for numerous inducing points. Through extensive experiments on tasks including representation learning, data imputation, and conditional generation, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms other GPVAE variants in both predictive performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We aim to develop a fundamental understanding of modality collapse, a recently observed empirical phenomenon wherein models trained for multimodal fusion tend to rely only on a subset of the modalities, ignoring the rest. We show that modality collapse happens when noisy features from one modality are entangled, via a shared set of neurons in the fusion head, with predictive features from another, effectively masking out positive contributions from the predictive features of the former modality and leading to its collapse. We further prove that cross-modal knowledge distillation implicitly disentangles such representations by freeing up rank bottlenecks in the student encoder, denoising the fusion-head outputs without negatively impacting the predictive features from either modality. Based on the above findings, we propose an algorithm that prevents modality collapse through explicit basis reallocation, with applications in dealing with missing modalities. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal benchmarks validate our theoretical claims. Project page: https://abhrac.github.io/mmcollapse/.

Abstract: In constrained Markov decision processes, enforcing constraints during training is often thought of as decreasing the final return. Recently, it was shown that constraints can be incorporated directly into the policy geometry, yielding an optimization trajectory close to the central path of a barrier method, which does not compromise final return. Building on this idea, we introduce Central Path Proximal Policy Optimization (C3PO), a simple modification of the PPO loss that produces policy iterates, that stay close to the central path of the constrained optimization problem. Compared to existing on-policy methods, C3PO delivers improved performance with tighter constraint enforcement, suggesting that central path-guided updates offer a promising direction for constrained policy optimization.

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) by utilizing a networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss function $\huaL_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$ can encompass a broad spectrum of robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel-based learning schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish a learning theory and offer comprehensive convergence analysis for the algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence convergence bounds for the local approximating sequence in terms of the mean square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover, we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors) in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing robustness and ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

Abstract: Real-world time series are often governed by complex nonlinear dynamics. Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for precise future prediction. While deep learning has achieved major success in time series forecasting, many existing approaches do not explicitly model the dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepEDM, a framework that integrates nonlinear dynamical systems modeling with deep neural networks. Inspired by empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) and rooted in Takens' theorem, DeepEDM presents a novel deep model that learns a latent space from time-delayed embeddings, and employs kernel regression to approximate the underlying dynamics, while leveraging efficient implementation of softmax attention and allowing for accurate prediction of future time steps. To evaluate our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments on synthetic data of nonlinear dynamical systems as well as real-world time series across domains. Our results show that DeepEDM is robust to input noise, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting accuracy. Our code is available at: https://abrarmajeedi.github.io/deep_edm.

Abstract: Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive, disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input. Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs. By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/pspdada/Omni-DPO.

Abstract: Learning an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space of a top-down generative model offers an expressive and interpretable framework for text and image generation. However, it remains unclear how this interpretability can be used to guide model design, improve generative quality, and reduce training time. Moreover, the reliance on Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) sampling presents challenges in efficiency and sampling multimodal latent distributions. In this work, we propose a novel adaptation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem for generative modeling and introduce the Thermodynamic Kolmogorov-Arnold Model (T-KAM) to take advantage of structural and inductive biases. By constraining the prior to univariate relationships, T-KAM enables fast and exact inference via the inverse transform method. With the low dimensionality of the latent space and suitable inductive biases encoded, we demonstrate that importance sampling becomes a viable, unbiased, and highly efficient training strategy. We also introduce a training criterion using population-based LMC, which decomposes posterior sampling into a sequence of annealed distributions to improve multimodal exploration. T-KAM elegantly balances common trade-offs in generative modeling, offering fast inference, high sample quality, and stable training, while being naturally suited to upcoming Zettascale Computing Co. hardware and extendable to other high-impact research directions in generative intelligence.

Abstract: Recent research shows how diffusion models can unconditionally generate tile-based game levels, but use of diffusion models for text-to-level generation is underexplored. There are practical considerations for creating a usable model: caption/level pairs are needed, as is a text embedding model, and a way of generating entire playable levels, rather than individual scenes. We present strategies to automatically assign descriptive captions to an existing dataset, and train diffusion models using both pretrained text encoders and simple transformer models trained from scratch. Captions are automatically assigned to generated scenes so that the degree of overlap between input and output captions can be compared. We also assess the diversity and playability of the resulting level scenes. Results are compared with an unconditional diffusion model and a generative adversarial network, as well as the text-to-level approaches Five-Dollar Model and MarioGPT. Notably, the best diffusion model uses a simple transformer model for text embedding, and takes less time to train than diffusion models employing more complex text encoders, indicating that reliance on larger language models is not necessary. We also present a GUI allowing designers to construct long levels from model-generated scenes.

Abstract: Foundation models are premised on the idea that sequence prediction can uncover deeper domain understanding, much like how Kepler's predictions of planetary motion later led to the discovery of Newtonian mechanics. However, evaluating whether these models truly capture deeper structure remains a challenge. We develop a technique for evaluating foundation models that examines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated world model. Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive bias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias probe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at their training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the underlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that foundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply Newtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals that these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail to generalize.

Abstract: In ReLU networks, gradients of output units can be seen as their input-level representations, as they correspond to the units' pullbacks through the active subnetwork. However, gradients of deeper models are notoriously misaligned, significantly contributing to their black-box nature. We claim that this is because active subnetworks are inherently noisy due to the ReLU hard-gating. To tackle that noise, we propose soft-gating in the backward pass only. The resulting input-level vector field (called ''excitation pullback'') exhibits remarkable perceptual alignment, revealing high-resolution input- and target-specific features that ''just make sense'', therefore establishing a compelling novel explanation method. Furthermore, we speculate that excitation pullbacks approximate (directionally) the gradients of a simpler model, linear in the network's path space, learned implicitly during optimization and largely determining the network's decision; thus arguing for the faithfulness of the produced explanations and their overall significance.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU), i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences. This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to benefit the community.

Abstract: We introduce Sophisticated Learning (SL), a planning-to-learn algorithm that embeds active parameter learning inside the Sophisticated Inference (SI) tree-search framework of Active Inference. Unlike SI -- which optimizes beliefs about hidden states -- SL also updates beliefs about model parameters within each simulated branch, enabling counterfactual reasoning about how future observations would improve subsequent planning.
  We compared SL with Bayes-adaptive Reinforcement Learning (BARL) agents as well as with its parent algorithm, SI. Using a biologically inspired seasonal foraging task in which resources shift probabilistically over a 10x10 grid, we designed experiments that forced agents to balance probabilistic reward harvesting against information gathering.
  In early trials, where rapid learning is vital, SL agents survive, on average, 8.2% longer than SI and 35% longer than Bayes-adaptive Reinforcement Learning. While both SL and SI showed equal convergence performance, SL reached this convergence 40% faster than SI. Additionally, SL showed robust out-performance of other algorithms in altered environment configurations.
  Our results show that incorporating active learning into multi-step planning materially improves decision making under radical uncertainty, and reinforces the broader utility of Active Inference for modeling biologically relevant behavior.

Abstract: Current deep learning-based approaches to lesion segmentation in neuroimaging often depend on high-resolution images and extensive annotated data, limiting clinical applicability. This paper introduces a novel synthetic data framework tailored for stroke lesion segmentation, expanding the SynthSeg methodology to incorporate lesion-specific augmentations that simulate diverse pathological features. Using a modified nnUNet architecture, our approach trains models with label maps from healthy and stroke datasets, facilitating segmentation across both normal and pathological tissue without reliance on specific sequence-based training. Evaluation across in-domain and out-of-domain (OOD) datasets reveals that our method matches state-of-the-art performance within the training domain and significantly outperforms existing methods on OOD data. By minimizing dependence on large annotated datasets and allowing for cross-sequence applicability, our framework holds potential to improve clinical neuroimaging workflows, particularly in stroke pathology. PyTorch training code and weights are publicly available at https://github.com/liamchalcroft/SynthStroke, along with an SPM toolbox featuring a plug-and-play model at https://github.com/liamchalcroft/SynthStrokeSPM.

<title>An Efficient Deep Learning Approach for Approximating Parameter-to-Solution Maps of PDEs</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider approximating the parameter-to-solution maps of parametric partial differential equations (PPDEs) using deep neural networks (DNNs). We propose an efficient approach combining reduced collocation methods (RCMs) and DNNs. In the approximation analysis section, we rigorously derive sharp upper bounds on the complexity of the neural networks. These bounds only depend on the reduced basis dimension rather than the high-fidelity discretization dimension, thereby theoretically guaranteeing the computational efficiency of our approach. In numerical experiments, we implement the RCM using radial basis function finite differences (RBF-FD) and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and propose the POD-DNN algorithm. We consider various types of PPDEs and compare the accuracy and efficiency of different solvers. The POD-DNN has demonstrated significantly accelerated inference speeds compared with conventional numerical methods owing to the offline-online computation strategy. Furthermore, by employing the reduced basis methods (RBMs), it also outperforms standard DNNs in computational efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference methods that feature correct conditional coverage of confidence sets based on observations that have been compressed to a scalar test statistic require accurate modeling of either the p-value function or the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the test statistic. If the model of the cdf, which is typically a deep neural network, is a function of the test statistic then the derivative of the neural network with respect to the test statistic furnishes an approximation of the sampling distribution of the test statistic. We explore whether this approach to modeling conditional 1-dimensional sampling distributions is a viable alternative to the probability density-ratio method, also known as the likelihood-ratio trick. Relatively simple, yet effective, neural network models are used whose predictive uncertainty is quantified through a variety of methods.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of brain tumors in intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) images could facilitate localization of tumor tissue during resection surgery. The lack of large annotated datasets limits the current models performances. In this paper, we investigated the use of tumor annotations in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which are more accessible than annotations in iUS images, for training of deep learning models for iUS brain tumor segmentation. We used 180 annotated MRI scans with corresponding unannotated iUS images, and 29 annotated iUS images. Image registration was performed to transfer the MRI annotations to the corresponding iUS images before training the nnU-Net model with different configurations of the data and label origins. The results showed no significant difference in Dice score for a model trained with only MRI annotated tumors compared to models trained with only iUS annotations and both, and to expert annotations, indicating that MRI tumor annotations can be used as a substitute for iUS tumor annotations to train a deep learning model for automatic brain tumor segmentation in iUS images. The best model obtained an average Dice score of $0.62\pm0.31$, compared to $0.67\pm0.25$ for an expert neurosurgeon, where the performance on larger tumors were similar, but lower for the models on smaller tumors. In addition, the results showed that removing smaller tumors from the training sets improved the results. The main models are available here: https://github.com/mathildefaanes/us_brain_tumor_segmentation/tree/main

Abstract: Adequately generating and evaluating prediction models based on supervised machine learning (ML) is often challenging, especially for less experienced users in applied research areas. Special attention is required in settings where the model generation process involves hyperparameter tuning, i.e. data-driven optimization of different types of hyperparameters to improve the predictive performance of the resulting model. Discussions about tuning typically focus on the hyperparameters of the ML algorithm (e.g., the minimum number of observations in each terminal node for a tree-based algorithm). In this context, it is often neglected that hyperparameters also exist for the preprocessing steps that are applied to the data before it is provided to the algorithm (e.g., how to handle missing feature values in the data). As a consequence, users experimenting with different preprocessing options to improve model performance may be unaware that this constitutes a form of hyperparameter tuning, albeit informal and unsystematic, and thus may fail to report or account for this optimization. To illuminate this issue, this paper reviews and empirically illustrates different procedures for generating and evaluating prediction models, explicitly addressing the different ways algorithm and preprocessing hyperparameters are typically handled by applied ML users. By highlighting potential pitfalls, especially those that may lead to exaggerated performance claims, this review aims to further improve the quality of predictive modeling in ML applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in statistical learning theory have revealed profound connections between mutual information (MI) bounds, PAC-Bayesian theory, and Bayesian nonparametrics. This work introduces a novel mutual information bound for statistical models. The derived bound has wide-ranging applications in statistical inference. It yields improved contraction rates for fractional posteriors in Bayesian nonparametrics. It can also be used to study a wide range of estimation methods, such as variational inference or Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). By bridging these diverse areas, this work advances our understanding of the fundamental limits of statistical inference and the role of information in learning from data. We hope that these results will not only clarify connections between statistical inference and information theory but also help to develop a new toolbox to study a wide range of estimators.

<title>GDSR: Global-Detail Integration through Dual-Branch Network with Wavelet Losses for Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution</title>

arXiv:2501.01460v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers, and State Space Models, have achieved significant progress in Remote Sensing Image (RSI) Super-Resolution (SR). However, existing SR methods typically overlook the complementary relationship between global and local dependencies. These methods either focus on capturing local information or prioritize global information, which results in models that are unable to effectively capture both global and local features simultaneously. Moreover, their computational cost becomes prohibitive when applied to large-scale RSIs. To address these challenges, we introduce the novel application of Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) to RSI-SR, which captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity. To simultaneously model global and local features, we propose the Global-Detail dual-branch structure, GDSR, which performs SR by paralleling RWKV and convolutional operations to handle large-scale RSIs. Furthermore, we introduce the Global-Detail Reconstruction Module (GDRM) as an intermediary between the two branches to bridge their complementary roles. In addition, we propose the Dual-Group Multi-Scale Wavelet Loss, a wavelet-domain constraint mechanism via dual-group subband strategy and cross-resolution frequency alignment for enhanced reconstruction fidelity in RSI-SR. Extensive experiments under two degradation methods on several benchmarks, including AID, UCMerced, and RSSRD-QH, demonstrate that GSDR outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer-based method HAT by an average of 0.09 dB in PSNR, while using only 63% of its parameters and 51% of its FLOPs, achieving an inference speed 3.2 times faster.

Abstract: Prediction-powered inference (PPI) enables valid statistical inference by combining experimental data with machine learning predictions. When a sufficient number of high-quality predictions is available, PPI results in more accurate estimates and tighter confidence intervals than traditional methods. In this paper, we propose to inform the PPI framework with prior knowledge on the quality of the predictions. The resulting method, which we call frequentist, assisted by Bayes, PPI (FAB-PPI), improves over PPI when the observed prediction quality is likely under the prior, while maintaining its frequentist guarantees. Furthermore, when using heavy-tailed priors, FAB-PPI adaptively reverts to standard PPI in low prior probability regions. We demonstrate the benefits of FAB-PPI in real and synthetic examples.

Abstract: Reliable detection of speech deepfakes (spoofs) must remain effective when the distribution of spoofing attacks shifts. We frame the task as domain generalization and show that inserting Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters into every attention head of a self-supervised (SSL) backbone, then training only those adapters with Meta-Learning Domain Generalization (MLDG), yields strong zero-shot performance. The resulting model updates about 3.6 million parameters, roughly 1.1% of the 318 million updated in full fine-tuning, yet surpasses a fully fine-tuned counterpart on five of six evaluation corpora. A first-order MLDG loop encourages the adapters to focus on cues that persist across attack types, lowering the average EER from 8.84% for the fully fine-tuned model to 5.30% with our best MLDG-LoRA configuration. Our findings show that combining meta-learning with parameter-efficient adaptation offers an effective method for zero-shot, distribution-shift-aware speech deepfake detection.

Abstract: Test-time inference has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enabling language models to ``think'' longer and more carefully about complex challenges, much like skilled human experts. While reinforcement learning (RL) can drive self-improvement in language models on verifiable tasks, some models exhibit substantial gains while others quickly plateau. For instance, we find that Qwen-2.5-3B far exceeds Llama-3.2-3B under identical RL training for the game of Countdown. This discrepancy raises a critical question: what intrinsic properties enable effective self-improvement? We introduce a framework to investigate this question by analyzing four key cognitive behaviors -- verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining -- that both expert human problem solvers and successful language models employ. Our study reveals that Qwen naturally exhibits these reasoning behaviors, whereas Llama initially lacks them. In systematic experimentation with controlled behavioral datasets, we find that priming Llama with examples containing these reasoning behaviors enables substantial improvements during RL, matching or exceeding Qwen's performance. Importantly, the presence of reasoning behaviors, rather than correctness of answers, proves to be the critical factor -- models primed with incorrect solutions containing proper reasoning patterns achieve comparable performance to those trained on correct solutions. Finally, leveraging continued pretraining with OpenWebMath data, filtered to amplify reasoning behaviors, enables the Llama model to match Qwen's self-improvement trajectory. Our findings establish a fundamental relationship between initial reasoning behaviors and the capacity for improvement, explaining why some language models effectively utilize additional computation while others plateau.

<title>Adaptive Bayesian Optimization for Robust Identification of Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>

arXiv:2503.06381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the identification of linear stochastic dynamical systems, where the unknowns include system coefficients and noise variances. Conventional approaches that rely on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) require nontrivial gradient computations and are prone to local optima. To overcome these limitations, a sample-efficient global optimization method based on Bayesian optimization (BO) is proposed, using an ensemble Gaussian process (EGP) surrogate with weighted kernels from a predefined dictionary. This ensemble enables a richer function space and improves robustness over single-kernel BO. Each objective evaluation is efficiently performed via Kalman filter recursion. Extensive experiments across parameter settings and sampling intervals show that the EGP-based BO consistently outperforms MLE via steady-state filtering and expectation-maximization (whose derivation is a side contribution) in terms of RMSE and statistical consistency. Unlike the ensemble variant, single-kernel BO does not always yield such gains, underscoring the benefits of model averaging. Notably, the BO-based estimator achieves RMSE below the classical Cramer-Rao bound, particularly for the inverse time constant, long considered difficult to estimate. This counterintuitive outcome is attributed to a data-driven prior implicitly induced by the GP surrogate in BO.

<title>Incorporating Coupling Knowledge into Echo State Networks for Learning Spatiotemporally Chaotic Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Machine learning methods have shown promise in learning chaotic dynamical systems, enabling model-free short-term prediction and attractor reconstruction. However, when applied to large-scale, spatiotemporally chaotic systems, purely data-driven machine learning methods often suffer from inefficiencies, as they require a large learning model size and a massive amount of training data to achieve acceptable performance. To address this challenge, we incorporate the spatial coupling structure of the target system as an inductive bias in the network design. Specifically, we introduce physics-guided clustered echo state networks, leveraging the efficiency of the echo state networks as a base model. Experimental results on benchmark chaotic systems demonstrate that our physics-informed method outperforms existing echo state network models in learning the target chaotic systems. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate that leveraging coupling knowledge into ESN models can enhance their robustness to variations of training and target system conditions. We further show that our proposed model remains effective even when the coupling knowledge is imperfect or extracted directly from time series data. We believe this approach has the potential to enhance other machine-learning methods.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new privacy challenges, particularly during inference where sensitive information in prompts may be exposed to proprietary LLM APIs. In this paper, we address the problem of formally protecting the sensitive information contained in a prompt while maintaining response quality. To this end, first, we introduce a cryptographically inspired notion of a prompt sanitizer which transforms an input prompt to protect its sensitive tokens. Second, we propose Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt, a novel system that implements a prompt sanitizer. Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt categorizes sensitive tokens into two types: (1) those where the LLM's response depends solely on the format (such as SSNs, credit card numbers), for which we use format-preserving encryption (FPE); and (2) those where the response depends on specific values, (such as age, salary) for which we apply metric differential privacy (mDP). Our evaluation demonstrates that Pr$\epsilon\epsilon$mpt is a practical method to achieve meaningful privacy guarantees, while maintaining high utility compared to unsanitized prompts, and outperforming prior methods

arXiv:2505.03470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods primarily depend on photometric and geometric consistency constraints. In contrast, modern learning-based algorithms often rely on the plane sweep algorithm to infer 3D geometry, applying explicit geometric consistency (GC) checks only as a post-processing step, with no impact on the learning process itself. In this work, we introduce GC MVSNet plus plus, a novel approach that actively enforces geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views (multi view) and at various scales (multi scale) during the learning phase (see Fig. 1). This integrated GC check significantly accelerates the learning process by directly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, effectively halving the number of training iterations compared to other MVS methods. Furthermore, we introduce a densely connected cost regularization network with two distinct block designs simple and feature dense optimized to harness dense feature connections for enhanced regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state of the art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets and secures second place on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To our knowledge, GC MVSNet plus plus is the first method to enforce multi-view, multi-scale supervised geometric consistency during learning. Our code is available.

arXiv:2507.10069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend LLMs to handle images, videos, and audio by incorporating feature extractors and projection modules. However, these additional components -- combined with complex inference pipelines and heterogeneous workloads -- introduce significant inference overhead. Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge. Current tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between mixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference stages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and poor resource utilization. To address this, we introduce Elastic Multimodal Parallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource heterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we develop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into independent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a modality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables parallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling; and (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching and non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that ElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by up to 4.2x and achieving 3.2-4.5x higher throughput while meeting service-level objectives (SLOs).

Abstract: Despite progress in language model (LM) capabilities, evaluations have thus far focused on models' performance on tasks that humans have previously solved, including in programming (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Glazer et al., 2024). We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.

Abstract: Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the Average Crossing (AC) algorithm--a fully decentralized mechanism for duplicating RWs to prevent RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis establishes that (i) the RW population remains almost surely bounded under AC and (ii) RW-based stochastic gradient descent remains convergent under AC, even in the presence of Pac-Man, with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings. Furthermore, they uncover a phase transition in the extinction probability as a function of the duplication threshold. We offer theoretical insights by analyzing a simplified variant of the AC, which sheds light on the observed phase transition.

Summary: This study introduces a novel graph-based framework that combines neural networks and symbolic analysis to explore mathematical relationships in physics equations. By starting with a large set of equations and focusing on advanced physics topics, the framework successfully identifies cross-domain connections and validates established theories. The system serves a dual purpose of generating hypotheses and auditing knowledge, producing hundreds of potential connections between different physics domains. Through symbolic analysis, the framework verifies theory consistencies, synthesizes new concepts, and highlights potential research areas. The intentional over-generation of candidates ensures thorough exploration of mathematical possibilities, even identifying errors that can be used for redundancy identification and knowledge base assessment. Overall, the framework transforms complex combinatorial spaces into manageable streams of mathematical patterns for further analysis. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The vast corpus of physics equations forms an implicit network of mathematical relationships that traditional analysis cannot fully explore. This work introduces a graph-based framework combining neural networks with symbolic analysis to systematically discover and validate mathematical patterns across physics domains. Starting from 659 equations, we performed rigorous semantic disambiguation to resolve notational polysemy affecting 213 equations, then focused on 400 advanced physics equations by excluding elementary mechanics to emphasize inter-branch connections of modern physics. This corpus was represented as a weighted knowledge graph where a Graph Attention Network achieved 97.4% AUC in link prediction, significantly outperforming classical baselines. The framework's primary value emerges from its dual capability: generating hypotheses and auditing knowledge. First, it functions as a hypothesis generator, producing hundreds of candidate cross-domain connections, from blackbody radiation coupled with Navier-Stokes equations to radioactive decay linked with electromagnetic induction. Second, through symbolic analysis of 30 equation clusters, it serves as a computational auditor that verified established theory consistencies, synthesized the Magnetic Reynolds Number from electromagnetic-fluid coupling, and revealed how even parsing errors could potentially point toward legitimate research like analog gravity. This proof-of-concept intentionally over-generates candidates to ensure comprehensive exploration of mathematical possibility space. Even tautologies and errors serve scientific purposes: redundancy identification and knowledge base quality assessment. The system transforms the intractable combinatorial space into a filtered stream of mathematical patterns for human interpretation.

Reward functions in existing work are predominantly based on heuristics, manual engineering, or task-specific tuning. In this work, we introduce a semantically aligned reinforcement learning method where rewards are computed by aligning the current state with a target semantic instruction using a Sentence-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SBERT). Instead of relying on manually defined reward functions, the policy receives feedback based on the reward, which is a cosine similarity between the goal textual description and the statement description in the episode. We evaluated our approach in several environments and showed that semantic reward can guide learning to achieve competitive control behavior, even in the absence of hand-crafted reward functions. Our study demonstrates a correlation between the language embedding space and the conventional Euclidean space. This framework opens new horizons for aligning agent behavior with natural language goals and lays the groundwork for a more seamless integration of larger language models (LLMs) and fluid control applications.

<div> Reinforcement Learning, preference optimization, sample efficiency, primacy bias, LLM finetuning
Summary: 
The article introduces LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a plugin designed to improve sample efficiency in preference-based optimization frameworks. LoRR allows for training at a high replay number, maximizing the usefulness of collected data batches. To combat overfitting, LoRR incorporates a periodic reset strategy that preserves network plasticity by reusing initial data. Additionally, LoRR uses a hybrid optimization objective combining supervised fine-tuning and preference-based losses to enhance data exploitation. Experimental results show that LoRR significantly enhances the performance of preference optimization methods on math and general reasoning benchmarks. A DPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on math tasks, surpassing some complex RL-based algorithms. This demonstrates LoRR's practicality, sample efficiency, and effectiveness in improving LLM performance with limited data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and preference optimization methods, are key drivers for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, these methods are often plagued by low sample efficiency and a susceptibility to primacy bias, where overfitting to initial experiences degrades policy quality and damages the learning process. To address these challenges, we introduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful plugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based optimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay number, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the risk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a periodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network plasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective, combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further bolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR significantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods on both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative DPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging math tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based algorithms. These findings highlight that LoRR offers a practical, sample-efficient, and highly effective paradigm for LLM finetuning, unlocking greater performance from limited data.

<div> Keywords: anomaly detection, SQL, database systems, machine learning, DistilBERT

Summary:
This paper presents a two-tiered anomaly detection approach for SQL using the DistilBERT model, combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. The unsupervised method identifies out-of-scope queries by flagging embedding vectors distant from normal user behavior patterns, while the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based models to detect internal attacks with high precision through role-labeled classification. The approach minimizes the need for data labeling and effectively safeguards critical database systems from both internal and external threats. By leveraging DistilBERT's efficiency and pre-trained capabilities, this method accurately identifies anomalous activities that may resemble normal behavior, thereby addressing the limitations of existing detection methods in capturing abnormal database access behaviors. Overall, this approach provides a robust solution for combating sophisticated attacks on database systems.

Abstract: Database systems are extensively used to store critical data across various domains. However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as database intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise. Internal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it easier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external masqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the organization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect anomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences of operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent normal behavior. On the other hand, some anomalous behaviors often resemble normal activities, making them difficult for existing detection methods to identify. This paper introduces a two-tiered anomaly detection approach for Structured Query Language (SQL) using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, specifically DistilBERT, a more efficient, pre-trained version. Our method combines both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to accurately identify anomalous activities while minimizing the need for data labeling. First, the unsupervised method uses ensemble anomaly detectors that flag embedding vectors distant from learned normal patterns of typical user behavior across the database (out-of-scope queries). Second, the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based models to detect internal attacks with high precision (in-scope queries), using role-labeled classification, even on limited labeled SQL data. Our findings make a significant contribution by providing an effective solution for safeguarding critical database systems from sophisticated threats.

Abstract: Blockchain-enabled federated learning (BCFL) addresses fundamental challenges of trust, privacy, and coordination in collaborative AI systems. This chapter provides comprehensive architectural analysis of BCFL systems through a systematic four-dimensional taxonomy examining coordination structures, consensus mechanisms, storage architectures, and trust models. We analyze design patterns from blockchain-verified centralized coordination to fully decentralized peer-to-peer networks, evaluating trade-offs in scalability, security, and performance. Through detailed examination of consensus mechanisms designed for federated learning contexts, including Proof of Quality and Proof of Federated Learning, we demonstrate how computational work can be repurposed from arbitrary cryptographic puzzles to productive machine learning tasks. The chapter addresses critical storage challenges by examining multi-tier architectures that balance blockchain's transaction constraints with neural networks' large parameter requirements while maintaining cryptographic integrity. A technical case study of the TrustMesh framework illustrates practical implementation considerations in BCFL systems through distributed image classification training, demonstrating effective collaborative learning across IoT devices with highly non-IID data distributions while maintaining complete transparency and fault tolerance. Analysis of real-world deployments across healthcare consortiums, financial services, and IoT security applications validates the practical viability of BCFL systems, achieving performance comparable to centralized approaches while providing enhanced security guarantees and enabling new models of trustless collaborative intelligence.

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across $200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

Summary: 
- The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a reinforcement learning algorithm in personalizing physical activity nudges through a Fitbit app in a large-scale randomized controlled trial.
- Participants were randomized into control, random, fixed, and reinforcement learning arms, with the reinforcement learning group showing a significant increase in daily step count compared to all other groups at 1 and 2 months.
- The reinforcement learning group sustained a significant increase in daily steps compared to the control group at 2 months.
- Generalized estimating equation models also supported the sustained increase in daily steps in the reinforcement learning group compared to the control group.
- The findings highlight the potential of using a scalable, behaviorally-informed reinforcement learning approach to personalize digital health interventions for promoting physical activity.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control, random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female, baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296 steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps, p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs. control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health interventions for PA.

<div> Keywords: time series forecasting, stability, accuracy, deep learning models, ensemble models 

Summary: 
The study focuses on the importance of forecast stability in time series forecasting for supply chain demand planning. While accuracy is crucial, consistency and stability are valued by demand planners in production systems. Model-induced stochasticity, which measures the variance of forecasts produced by a single model with fixed inputs, is key to determining stability. The research evaluates the stability and accuracy of various state-of-the-art forecasting models on public datasets. Results show that ensemble models enhance stability without compromising forecast accuracy, and in some cases even improving it. The paper emphasizes the need for further research on forecast stability in models deployed in production systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements. Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST, Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising, the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars. We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly, our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains practical.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

arXiv:2508.10118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code executability over existing VLMs.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function. While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy for deep neural networks aimed at capturing complex temporal patterns in time series data. The proposed method uses rotational equiangular tight frame-classifiers and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with limited labeled samples. In addition, generative pretext tasks are integrated into the method to effectively capture temporal dynamics and enforce embedding separability. A novel sequential augmentation strategy is defined to enhance the pre-training process. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied to various types of neural network models on multivariate time series classification datasets. These findings underscore the importance of aligning pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns, to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively. In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space. Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and 25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05% AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95 across four OOD datasets

<div> population level, linear convergence, regression parameters, Euclidean distance, finite-sample level

Summary:
The paper focuses on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm's behavior in overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) models with unknown parameters. The study investigates the convergence rates and accuracy levels in population and finite-sample scenarios. Theoretical results show linear convergence of regression parameters with unbalanced initial mixing weights and sublinear convergence with balanced mixing weights. Statistical accuracies are demonstrated to be dependent on the balance of mixing weights, with different rates for unbalanced and balanced cases. The connection between population and finite-sample results is highlighted, leading to intuitive iteration complexity bounds. The analysis is further extended to the low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regime, providing insights into the behavior of the EM algorithm in the presence of model misspecification. <div>

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown $d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the $\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$ given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$ for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and $O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

Summary: 
The evaluation of reasoning language models has become crucial as they demonstrate the ability to combine existing capabilities into new ways of problem-solving. The study emphasizes that superior performance is not solely due to algorithmic enhancements or model size but also the use of impactful benchmarks as learning curricula. This approach, known as benchmark-driven selection of AI, highlights the significance of challenging benchmarks in enhancing the generalization capabilities of reasoning models. By steering the development of AI through impactful benchmarks, the evaluation process is transformed into a learning experience, where the novelty of test tasks plays a key role in measuring the model's ability to generalize. Ultimately, benchmarks are viewed as essential curricula for model training rather than merely unseen test sets. <div>

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models. Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather than unseen test sets.

Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data, including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency, Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models for sustainable livestock management.

Summary: 
An AI-driven pipeline has been developed to extract and analyze handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, providing a cost-effective and scalable source of forensic evidence for disrupting the transnational ivory trade. By analyzing 6,085 photographs from eight large seizures of ivory, over 17,000 individual markings were extracted and labeled using AI tools. 184 recurring "signature markings" were identified, with 20 of them connecting multiple seizures and establishing forensic links between traffickers involved in both shipments. This innovative approach complements traditional investigative techniques and fills gaps in data where genetic evidence is unavailable or costly. The study showcases the potential of AI in wildlife forensics and offers practical steps for integrating handwriting analysis into efforts aimed at combating organized wildlife crime.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel, scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085 photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period (2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000 individual markings, which were then labeled and described using state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings" that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

<br />
Summary: The study assesses the quality of sampling from RBMs using a local-valley (LV) centered approach on the D-Wave quantum annealer. Comparisons were made between samples obtained from D-Wave and Gibbs sampling, focusing on the number of LVs and energy of local minima. Results showed no significant increase in the number of LVs with decreased D-Wave annealing time. While D-Wave samples covered a slightly higher number of LVs compared to Gibbs, there was limited overlap in identified LVs between the two methods. Additionally, important local minima with intermediate probability values were only found by one sampling technique. The overlap between D-Wave and Gibbs decreased at later training epochs, suggesting a potential for improved sampling quality at this stage. The findings suggest the potential for enhancement through a combined classical-quantum approach. <div>
arXiv:2508.10228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch, the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

<div> Key: cirrhosis, acute kidney injury, machine learning, prediction, intensive care unit <br />
Summary: <br />
- The study developed a machine learning model for early prediction of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients with cirrhosis using clinical variables. <br />
- Data from 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis were analyzed, and LightGBM algorithm achieved the best performance with an AUROC of 0.808. <br />
- Key predictors identified for AKI risk included prolonged partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH, and altered pO2. <br />
- The model's high negative predictive value (0.911) allows safe de-escalation for low-risk patients and supports targeted prevention strategies. <br />
- The results suggest actionable targets for early intervention and highlight the importance of accurate risk stratification for AKI in cirrhotic patients in ICU settings. <br />  <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database, identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression, naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC, accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI 0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH, and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables. Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention. External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are warranted.

Summary: 
In this paper, the authors introduce a novel application of in-context learning (ICL) for cryptographic function learning, specifically focusing on mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere ciphers. These ciphers involve a hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text characters. The goal is for the model to infer the substitution given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs and decode a new cipher text word. This structured inference challenge allows for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of transformers under the ICL paradigm. The study demonstrates the ability of transformer-based language models to learn and generalize over complex cryptographic functions purely from context, without performing any parameter updates. The code for this project is freely available on GitHub for further exploration and experimentation.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of transformers under the ICL paradigm.

<div> backdoor attack, transformer, HPMI, pruning, injection<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces HPMI, a novel retraining-free backdoor attack method for transformers. HPMI does not require altering the model's architecture and only needs a small subset of original data and basic knowledge of the model architecture. By pruning the least important head and injecting a pre-trained malicious head, HPMI establishes a backdoor that is resistant to detection and removal by current defense techniques. Experimental evaluations show that HPMI maintains high attack success rates while incurring minimal clean accuracy loss, and it successfully bypasses advanced defense mechanisms. Compared to retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI demonstrates greater concealment and robustness against different defense strategies. <div>
arXiv:2508.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer. Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean accuracy.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale scheduling environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud computing environments.

Summary:
This paper introduces a new method for source component shift adaptation in data streams. Existing online learning approaches struggle to effectively utilize recurring shifts and model-pool-based methods have difficulty capturing individual source components. The proposed method combines offline decomposition and online mixing to address these challenges. By first decomposing source components offline using the EM algorithm and then adapting mixing weights online through convex optimization, the method achieves superior adaptation performance compared to existing approaches. Experimental results on real-world regression datasets show a significant reduction in cumulative test loss of up to 67.4%. The method's theoretical foundation allows it to leverage shift characteristics effectively and outperform baseline methods. <div>

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

<br />Summary: <br /> 
The article introduces a new approach to Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management using a conformal prediction framework to anticipate medication needs up to two years in advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Current approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive methods, leading to inadequate symptom control or side effects. The framework addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data and provides precise predictions for short-term planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying uncertainty, the approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving life quality. The study uses electronic health records from inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health to develop and test the framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting required medication adjustments. <div>

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from 631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving life quality.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces SynBrain, a generative framework that models the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain utilizes BrainVAE for probabilistic learning of neural representations and a Semantic-to-Neural Mapper for projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold for fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding and efficient adaptation to new subjects with limited data. SynBrain also captures functional consistency across trials and subjects, revealing interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The synthesized fMRI signals enhance data-limited fMRI-to-image decoding performance. The code for SynBrain will be publicly available. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will be made publicly available.

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces Federated Knowledge-Enhanced Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework for leveraging past knowledge to generate informed initializations for learning new tasks in healthcare settings using federated learning. FedKEI starts with global clustering to generalize knowledge across tasks and optimizes aggregation weights across and within clusters to personalize knowledge transfer for new tasks. A bi-level optimization scheme is used to collaboratively learn global intra-cluster weights and optimize local inter-cluster weights. Experiments on dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT datasets show that FedKEI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in adapting to new diseases. <div>

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities, including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning often assume homogeneous client data distributions or require a clean server dataset, limiting their practicality. The CLIP-Fed framework proposes a novel defense approach that utilizes vision-language pre-training models to tackle backdoor attacks in the presence of heterogeneous client data distributions. By incorporating both pre- and post-aggregation defense strategies, CLIP-Fed mitigates the limitations posed by Non-IID data. It constructs and augments the server dataset using multimodal language models and frequency analysis, without client samples, to address privacy concerns and enhance dataset coverage against diverse triggers. CLIP-Fed aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence to address class prototype deviations and eliminate trigger-label correlations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with reduced Attack Success Rate (ASR) and improved Model Accuracy (MA) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10-LT datasets. <div>

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies, CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness. To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

Summary: 
Fair clustering traditionally focused on equitable representation or equal clustering costs, but recent research suggests these notions may lead to suboptimal results. A welfare-centric approach, considering group utilities based on distances and representation, offers a new perspective. Two optimization objectives, Rawlsian and Utilitarian, are proposed to address this. Novel algorithms are introduced with theoretical guarantees. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing fair clustering methods. This work highlights the importance of considering group welfare in clustering algorithms for more equitable and efficient outcomes.

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However, Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform existing fair clustering baselines.

Summary: 
The article discusses the vulnerabilities of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to cyberattacks and the limitations of traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Due to the heterogeneous and resource-constrained nature of IoMT devices, running IDSs locally is often infeasible, and delays in updating models leave devices exposed to zero-day attacks. To address these challenges, the proposed multi-level IoMT IDS framework utilizes a near-Edge layer for coarse traffic filtering using meta-learning or One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm, followed by far Edge and Cloud layers for identifying attack types and novelty. Experimental results on the CICIoMT2024 dataset demonstrate high accuracy in detecting zero-day attacks and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The meta-learning approach achieves strong performance, making it suitable for real-world IoMT environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained, heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables), making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024 dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets, ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the meta-learning approach achieves high.

Summary: 
This paper examines distribution learning in semantic communication, where receivers must infer underlying meaning distributions from sequential observations. The research establishes conditions for learning source statistics when priors are unknown. It shows that the full rank of the effective transmission matrix is essential for learnability and provides insights into the convergence rate of distribution estimation. The analysis also highlights a trade-off between encoding schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance and long-term learnability. Experimental validation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates the impact of system conditioning on learning rate and performance. The results offer valuable design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with adaptation capability. <div>

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication. This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework, demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with adaptation capability.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$ fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and 2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area, 9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

It addresses the lack of evaluation frameworks in assessing ITL methods' ability to capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations. To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation framework.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces XQuant, a new algorithm that reduces memory consumption in large language models (LLMs) through low-bit quantization. By quantizing and caching layer input activations instead of using standard KV caching, XQuant achieves a 2x memory savings compared to traditional methods. XQuant also leverages the similarity of X values across layers to introduce XQuant-CL, which further compresses memory usage. XQuant-CL can achieve up to 10x memory savings with minimal perplexity degradation. By exploiting the increasing compute capabilities of hardware platforms, XQuant surpasses state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and maintains near-FP16 accuracy across various models. The approach of trading increased computation for reduced memory operations in LLM inference proves to be highly effective and efficient. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods. We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X, instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$ memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to $\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to 10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01 perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$ perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly available.

Summary: 
The study investigates Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) in tensorized models and scale-invariant settings. SAM's regularization behavior is analyzed, revealing its control over core norm imbalances through covariance between core norms and gradient magnitudes. A new method, Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS), is proposed to mimic SAM's regularization by adaptively scaling core norms based on data. Experimental results across various tasks like tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning demonstrate that DAS outperforms SAM with less computational overhead. <div>
arXiv:2508.10435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes. Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method, \emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

<div> framework, counterfactual explanations, realism, feasibility, user-centric<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces RealAC, a domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable counterfactual explanations in AI decision-making. RealAC aligns joint distributions of feature pairs to preserve inter-feature dependencies without explicit domain knowledge. It allows users to freeze attributes they don't want to change and offers realistic and feasible explanations. Evaluations show RealAC outperforms existing methods in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and realism metrics. It provides a solution for causality-aware and user-centric counterfactual generation. <div>
arXiv:2508.10455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover, they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric counterfactual generation.

Summary:
X-Node is a novel self-explaining GNN framework that ensures interpretability in decision-making processes. Each node in the GNN generates its own explanation by encoding interpretable cues like degree and feature saliency within its local topology. A Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation vector that reconstructs the node's latent embedding, generates natural language explanations, and guides the GNN through a "text-injection" mechanism. X-Node maintains competitive accuracy in classification tasks while providing faithful, per-node explanations. The framework is evaluated on graph datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrated with popular GNN backbones like GCN, GAT, and GIN. The code repository is available on GitHub for further exploration.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality, clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3) guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT, and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations. Repository: https://github.com/basiralab/X-Node.

<div> GraphFedMIG, federated graph learning, generative adversarial network, statistical heterogeneity, class imbalance <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces GraphFedMIG, a novel framework for federated graph learning to address challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity and class imbalance. GraphFedMIG utilizes a hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local generator to synthesize feature representations. Clients are grouped into clusters with dedicated discriminators, and a mutual information-guided mechanism is employed to correct generator parameters and focus on producing high-value, minority-class features. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate GraphFedMIG's superior performance compared to other baselines. <div>
arXiv:2508.10471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private, decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information, hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators. By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value, minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

<div> calibration-free BCIs, continual model adaptation, personalized decoder, neural signal drift, accuracy improvement <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces EDAPT, a novel framework for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that eliminates the need for frequent recalibration by continually adapting the model during use. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple users and then personalizes this model through supervised finetuning as neural patterns evolve over time. The framework was tested across nine datasets for three BCI tasks and consistently outperformed conventional static methods, with improvements attributed to population-level pretraining and online finetuning. Additionally, unsupervised domain adaptation provided further gains in some datasets. Importantly, EDAPT updates models efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, with decoding accuracy scaling with data budget rather than its allocation between subjects and trials. Overall, EDAPT offers a practical solution for calibration-free BCIs, addressing a key barrier to wider deployment. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

Summary:
Unobserved confounding, a common issue in observational studies, also affects recommender systems when observed features are ignored. Practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing, and modularization can introduce confounding and reduce system performance. This paper demonstrates through simulation studies how these practices can lead to biased causal effect estimates in recommendation systems. It provides practical suggestions for practitioners to minimize or eliminate the effects of confounding in real-world systems, emphasizing the importance of considering unmeasured features that may influence both the treatment and outcome. By highlighting the vulnerability of recommender systems to unobserved confounding, this paper urges practitioners to be cautious in their design and implementation to ensure accurate and reliable recommendations.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine, ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of convex constraints. Our approach, $\Pi$net, leverages operator splitting for rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems and obtain modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single problem, and significantly faster for a batch of problems. We surpass state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution quality, and robustness to hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining similar inference times. Finally, we tackle multi-vehicle motion planning with non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package implemented in JAX with effective tuning heuristics.

Summary: 
This study introduces a spectral framework to analyze and quantify the smoothness and faithfulness of explanations produced by ReLU networks. It addresses the noisy and difficult to interpret nature of vanilla gradient-based explanations by examining the trade-off between smoothness and faithfulness. The research identifies and regularizes the contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, offering a principled approach to balancing these factors. The analysis reveals how surrogate-based smoothing techniques can distort explanations, leading to an "explanation gap" that is measured across various post-hoc methods. By validating the theoretical findings across different scenarios and datasets, the study provides valuable insights into improving the interpretability of explanations generated by ReLU networks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions, sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods, such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an ``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design choices, datasets, and ablations.

Traditional ECOC methods require manual or random codebook design, which can be time-consuming and suboptimal.

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four datasets, our proposed models demonstrate superior robustness to adversarial attacks compared to two baselines.

Summary:
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System) is a modular framework that integrates multimodal understanding and generation through two distinct phases: Cognition and Deliberation. In the Cognition phase, three role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents collaborate to perform structured understanding and planning. The Deliberation phase includes a Growth-Aware Search mechanism that combines reasoning and generation in a mutually reinforcing way. MAGUS supports extensibility, any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment without joint training. Experimental results across various benchmarks show that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art systems, including surpassing the closed-source model GPT-4o on the MME benchmark. <div>

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities, enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text, image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases: Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector - engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility, scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

Summary:
This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing complex cost functions in combinatorial optimization problems using traditional MCMC algorithms. Conventional MCMC approaches struggle near computational phase transitions due to the overlap-gap property, resulting in difficulties unfreezing rigid variables and escaping suboptimal solutions. To overcome these challenges, Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms with inhomogeneous temperature profiles were introduced. This study utilizes deep reinforcement learning to train nonlocal transition policies for NMC, leveraging energy changes and landscape geometry as rewards and states, respectively. The trained policies outperform standard MCMC and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy, time-to-solution, and solution diversity. Overall, the integration of deep RL into NMC algorithms enhances performance in tackling challenging combinatorial optimization problems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy, time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

Summary:
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD) is introduced as a test-time framework that allows for constrained joint generation from multiple pre-trained diffusion models. PCD incorporates a coupled guidance term into the generative dynamics to promote coordination between diffusion models and includes a projection step at each diffusion step to enforce specific constraints. The proposed method is demonstrated to be effective in scenarios such as image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning. Results indicate improved coupling effects and guarantee constraint satisfaction without excessive computational costs. PCD addresses the challenge of generating jointly correlated samples from multiple diffusion models while enforcing task-specific constraints, providing a promising solution for various application scenarios.

arXiv:2508.10531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model. However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning. Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

arXiv:2508.10541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses, represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM, originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets to facilitate future research.

Summary:
The article addresses the challenge of reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning tasks, particularly in the context of software engineering. Existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to define meaningful immediate rewards without bias or task decomposition. The proposed SWE-oriented RL Framework supports multi-turn interaction and customizable reward functions. Additionally, the Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA) method accumulates immediate rewards only when high-level rewards meet a predefined threshold, leading to stable RL optimization. Experimental results on SWE-bench Verified and kBench show significant improvements in completion rates and modification rates, without suffering from reward misalignment issues. The study emphasizes the importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL tasks and provides a practical solution through G-RA.

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction, docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates (47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a practical solution.

Summary: 
CATE-B is introduced as an open-source co-pilot system that leverages large language models to assist in estimating treatment effects from observational data. The system guides users through the process of constructing a structural causal model, identifying robust adjustment sets, and selecting appropriate regression methods. By combining causal inference with intelligent assistance, CATE-B aims to make the task of treatment effect estimation more accessible.

CATE-B serves as a tool to lower the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and pave the way for automated treatment effect estimation benchmarks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.10581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy. While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

<div> Graph Representation, Model Unification, Generalizability, Domain-Fracture, Deep Learning

Summary:
Unified learning is proposed to address the challenge of maintaining generalizability in medical imaging deep learning models under domain-fracture scenarios. This paradigm encodes individual models into a graph representation, enabling unification in a shared graph learning space. A graph neural network (GNN) guides the optimization of these unified models, allowing for parameter sharing and knowledge transfer across varying architectures and distributions. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two MedMNIST benchmarks demonstrate that unified learning improves performance when models are trained on unique distributions and tested on mixed ones, showcasing robustness to unseen data with large distribution shifts. The code and benchmarks for this approach are available on GitHub.

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability, remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large distribution shifts.

<title>Self-Supervised Temporal Super-Resolution of Energy Data using Generative Adversarial Transformer</title>

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue, this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application scenario is improved by 13%.

<title>FreeGAD: A Training-Free yet Effective Approach for Graph Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically, it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any training or iterative optimization.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii) an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is a collaborative learning approach that improves privacy by keeping data on the client-side while sharing only the intermediate output with a server. However, the distributed nature of SL introduces new security challenges, necessitating a comprehensive exploration of potential attacks. This paper systematically reviews various attacks on SL, classifying them based on factors such as the attacker's role, the type of privacy risks, when data leaks occur, and where vulnerabilities exist. We also analyze existing defense methods, including cryptographic methods, data modification approaches, distributed techniques, and hybrid solutions. Our findings reveal security gaps, highlighting the effectiveness and limitations of existing defenses. By identifying open challenges and future directions, this work provides valuable information to improve SL privacy issues and guide further research.

<title>Variance Reduced Policy Gradient Method for Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10608</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward. This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL, policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces. In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy gradients while maintaining general assumptions.

<title>Beyond Random Sampling: Instance Quality-Based Data Partitioning via Item Response Theory</title>

Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

<title>Energy-Based Models for Predicting Mutational Effects on Proteins</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10629</link>

Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between $\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate $\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states, allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new $\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization against SARS-CoV-2.

<title>Conditional Information Bottleneck for Multimodal Fusion: Overcoming Shortcut Learning in Sarcasm Detection</title>

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut learning.

<title>SPHENIC: Topology-Informed Multi-View Clustering for Spatial Transcriptomics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14 benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

<title>Geospatial Diffusion for Land Cover Imperviousness Change Forecasting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10649</link>

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq 0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns from historical data that are significant for projecting future change. Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of different scenarios by means of driver variables.

We investigate a comprehensive class of Weisfeiler-Leman variants obtained by modifying the underlying logical framework and establish a precise theoretical characterization of their expressive power. We then test two selected variants on twelve benchmark datasets that span a range of different domains. The experiments demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art graph neural networks and graph kernels while being more time or memory efficient, depending on the dataset. We also briefly discuss directly extracting interpretable modal logic formulas from graph datasets.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function $\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning, combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural $\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and potential of the proposed framework.

<title>REFN: A Reinforcement-Learning-From-Network Framework against 1-day/n-day Exploitations</title>

arXiv:2508.10701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching (average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations. REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways (Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that translates language context (vulnerability description) into network enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22 families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1 percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of 3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n day exploitations.

Abstract: This study proposes an antenna simulation framework powered by graphics processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs. Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations. Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the simulations is sufficiently fine.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has presented a significant challenge to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL, we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial. Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model (i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover, Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a potential future direction.

This work explores combining the Erwin architecture with the Native Sparse Attention (NSA) mechanism to improve the efficiency and receptive field of transformer models for large-scale physical systems, addressing the challenge of quadratic attention complexity. We adapt the NSA mechanism for non-sequential data, implement the Erwin NSA model, and evaluate it on three datasets from the physical sciences -- cosmology simulations, molecular dynamics, and air pressure modeling -- achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of the original Erwin model. Additionally, we reproduce the experimental results from the Erwin paper to validate their implementation.

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design. Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to 64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus 3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation error.

<title>Enhancing Fairness in Autoencoders for Node-Level Graph Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks (GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements. However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed, GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data, potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection. To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose \textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods.

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\; algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty. However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior. The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets, including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP algorithm.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration. This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles, including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation), memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing, forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning (ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML). At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners, complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like "what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them broadly applicable to various attribution tasks.

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce \ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e. SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM, CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average. Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly as effective. We release our dataset at \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}, and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards. Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all evaluated tasks.

Abstract: Automating data extraction from clinical documents offers significant potential to improve efficiency in healthcare settings, yet deploying Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions presents practical challenges. Drawing upon our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations, generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health outcomes.

Abstract: Currently, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are deployed in an extensive range of applications. However, recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of adversarial attack on these models which could potentially suppress or disrupt model output. We investigate and verify the robustness of these attacks and explore if it is possible to increase their imperceptibility. We additionally find that by relaxing the optimisation objective from complete suppression to partial suppression, we can further decrease the imperceptibility of the attack. We also explore possible defences against these attacks and show a low-pass filter defence could potentially serve as an effective defence.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of enzyme kinetics literature has outpaced the curation capabilities of major biochemical databases, creating a substantial barrier to AI-driven modeling and knowledge discovery. We present zERExtractor, an automated and extensible platform for comprehensive extraction of enzyme-catalyzed reaction and activity data from scientific literature. zERExtractor features a unified, modular architecture that supports plug-and-play integration of state-of-the-art models, including large language models (LLMs), as interchangeable components, enabling continuous system evolution alongside advances in AI. Our pipeline combines domain-adapted deep learning, advanced OCR, semantic entity recognition, and prompt-driven LLM modules, together with human expert corrections, to extract kinetic parameters (e.g., kcat, Km), enzyme sequences, substrate SMILES, experimental conditions, and molecular diagrams from heterogeneous document formats. Through active learning strategies integrating AI-assisted annotation, expert validation, and iterative refinement, the system adapts rapidly to new data sources. We also release a large benchmark dataset comprising over 1,000 annotated tables and 5,000 biological fields from 270 P450-related enzymology publications. Benchmarking demonstrates that zERExtractor consistently outperforms existing baselines in table recognition (Acc 89.9%), molecular image interpretation (up to 99.1%), and relation extraction (accuracy 94.2%). zERExtractor bridges the longstanding data gap in enzyme kinetics with a flexible, plugin-ready framework and high-fidelity extraction, laying the groundwork for future AI-powered enzyme modeling and biochemical knowledge discovery.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events, or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation detection. The code and data have been released.

Abstract: When developing text classification models for real world applications, one major challenge is the difficulty to collect sufficient data for all text classes. In this work, we address this challenge by utilizing large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and using such data to improve the performance of the models without waiting for more real data to be collected and labelled. As an LLM generates different synthetic data in response to different input examples, we formulate an automated workflow, which searches for input examples that lead to more ``effective'' synthetic data for improving the model concerned. We study three search strategies with an extensive set of experiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that selects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class. Our further experiments demonstrate that this ensemble approach is more effective than each individual strategy in our automated workflow for improving classification models using LLMs.

<title>User Perception of Attention Visualizations: Effects on Interpretability Across Evidence-Based Medical Documents</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture. Beyond improving performance, attention has been proposed as a mechanism for explainability via attention weights, which are associated with input features (e.g., tokens in a document). In this context, larger attention weights may imply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based medicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and interaction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However, there is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful explanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention affects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted a user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in biomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to visualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who classified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad synthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the Transformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the attention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the predictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how attention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual effectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred more intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our results do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for explanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how they are visually presented.

To circumvent the need for costly fine-tuning, this paper proposes and evaluates the use of Bayesian fusion. The approach combines the multidimensional classification scores of a pre-trained generic LLM with those of a classifier trained on local data. The performance comparison demonstrated that the proposed fusion improves the results compared to each classifier individually, and is competitive with the LLM fine-tuning approach

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents a groundbreaking approach for collaborative health research, allowing model training on decentralized data while safeguarding patient privacy. FL offers formal security guarantees when combined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies, however, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical utility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often present in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these interconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL framework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial experiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data, resulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first integrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek Links (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically useful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using a tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear trade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the optimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal operational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong privacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high clinical utility (recall greater than 77%). Ultimately, our study provides a practical methodological blueprint for creating effective, secure, and accurate diagnostic tools that can be applied to real-world, heterogeneous healthcare data.

Abstract: Among the many challenges mothers undergo after childbirth, postpartum depression (PPD) is a severe condition that significantly impacts their mental and physical well-being. Consequently, the rapid detection of ppd and their associated risk factors is critical for in-time assessment and intervention through specialized prevention procedures. Accordingly, this work addresses the need to help practitioners make decisions with the latest technological advancements to enable real-time screening and treatment recommendations. Mainly, our work contributes to an intelligent PPD screening system that combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language Models (LLMs) towards an affordable, real-time, and non-invasive free speech analysis. Moreover, it addresses the black box problem since the predictions are described to the end users thanks to the combination of LLMs with interpretable ml models (i.e., tree-based algorithms) using feature importance and natural language. The results obtained are 90 % on ppd detection for all evaluation metrics, outperforming the competing solutions in the literature. Ultimately, our solution contributes to the rapid detection of PPD and their associated risk factors, critical for in-time and proper assessment and intervention.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable, token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning (LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4% and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH benchmark.

Abstract: Personalised text generation is essential for user-centric information systems, yet most evaluation methods overlook the individuality of users. We introduce \textbf{PREF}, a \textbf{P}ersonalised \textbf{R}eference-free \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{F}ramework that jointly measures general output quality and user-specific alignment without requiring gold personalised references. PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a large language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific guideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and completeness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these factors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and context, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage applies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring baseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of coverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability, and allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger ones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit preference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better calibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines. By enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the groundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised language generation systems.

Abstract: Jet classification in high-energy particle physics is important for understanding fundamental interactions and probing phenomena beyond the Standard Model. Jets originate from the fragmentation and hadronization of quarks and gluons, and pose a challenge for identification due to their complex, multidimensional structure. Traditional classification methods often fall short in capturing these intricacies, necessitating advanced machine learning approaches. In this paper, we employ two neural networks simultaneously as an ensemble to tag various jet types. We convert the jet data to two-dimensional histograms instead of representing them as points in a higher-dimensional space. Specifically, this ensemble approach, hereafter referred to as Ensemble Model, is used to tag jets into classes from the JetNet dataset, corresponding to: Top Quarks, Light Quarks (up or down), and W and Z bosons. For the jet classes mentioned above, we show that the Ensemble Model can be used for both binary and multi-categorical classification. This ensemble approach learns jet features by leveraging the strengths of each constituent network achieving superior performance compared to either individual network.

Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose a significant threat to smart grid infrastructures, particularly Home Area Networks (HANs), where real-time monitoring and control are highly adopted. Owing to the comparatively less stringent security controls and widespread availability of HANs, attackers view them as an attractive entry point to manipulate aggregated demand patterns, which can ultimately propagate and disrupt broader grid operations. These attacks undermine the integrity of smart meter data, enabling malicious actors to manipulate consumption values without activating conventional alarms, thereby creating serious vulnerabilities across both residential and utility-scale infrastructures. This paper presents a machine learning-based framework for both the detection and classification of FDIAs using residential energy data. A real-time detection is provided by the lightweight Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which works by using the most vital features of energy consumption, cost, and time context. For the classification of different attack types, a Bidirectional LSTM is trained to recognize normal, trapezoidal, and sigmoid attack shapes through learning sequential dependencies in the data. A synthetic time-series dataset was generated to emulate realistic household behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models are effective in identifying and classifying FDIAs, offering a scalable solution for enhancing grid resilience at the edge. This work contributes toward building intelligent, data-driven defence mechanisms that strengthen smart grid cybersecurity from residential endpoints.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for few-shot information extraction (IE), yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of in-context examples. Conventional selection strategies often fail to provide informative guidance, as they overlook a key source of model fallibility: confusion stemming not just from semantic content, but also from the generation of well-structured formats required by IE tasks. To address this, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel active prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective confusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a dual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format Uncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty (inconsistency in extracted semantics). By ranking unlabeled data with this comprehensive score, our framework actively selects the most challenging and informative samples to serve as few-shot exemplars. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, yielding significant improvements in both extraction accuracy and robustness. Our work highlights the critical importance of a fine-grained, dual-level view of model uncertainty when it comes to building effective and reliable structured generation systems.

<title>Bayesian Models for Joint Selection of Features and Auto-Regressive Lags: Theory and Applications in Environmental and Financial Forecasting</title>

Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for variable selection in linear regression with autocorrelated errors, accommodating lagged covariates and autoregressive structures. This setting occurs in time series applications where responses depend on contemporaneous or past explanatory variables and persistent stochastic shocks, including financial modeling, hydrological forecasting, and meteorological applications requiring temporal dependency capture. Our methodology uses hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors to simultaneously select relevant covariates and lagged error terms. We propose an efficient two-stage MCMC algorithm separating sampling of variable inclusion indicators and model parameters to address high-dimensional computational challenges. Theoretical analysis establishes posterior selection consistency under mild conditions, even when candidate predictors grow exponentially with sample size, common in modern time series with many potential lagged variables. Through simulations and real applications (groundwater depth prediction, S&amp;P 500 log returns modeling), we demonstrate substantial gains in variable selection accuracy and predictive performance. Compared to existing methods, our framework achieves lower MSPE, improved true model component identification, and greater robustness with autocorrelated noise, underscoring practical utility for model interpretation and forecasting in autoregressive settings.

<title>Dynamical Alignment: A Principle for Adaptive Neural Computation</title>

Abstract: The computational capabilities of a neural network are widely assumed to be determined by its static architecture. Here we challenge this view by establishing that a fixed neural structure can operate in fundamentally different computational modes, driven not by its structure but by the temporal dynamics of its input signals. We term this principle 'Dynamical Alignment'.
  Applying this principle offers a novel resolution to the long-standing paradox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform. By encoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a bimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by phase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting dynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes. In contrast, an 'expansive' mode, driven by expanding dynamics, unlocks the representational power required for SNNs to match or even exceed their artificial neural network counterparts on diverse tasks, including classification, reinforcement learning, and cognitive integration.
  We find this computational advantage emerges from a timescale alignment between input dynamics and neuronal integration. This principle, in turn, offers a unified, computable perspective on long-observed dualities in neuroscience, from stability-plasticity dilemma to segregation-integration dynamic. It demonstrates that computation in both biological and artificial systems can be dynamically sculpted by 'software' on fixed 'hardware', pointing toward a potential paradigm shift for AI research: away from designing complex static architectures and toward mastering adaptive, dynamic computation principles.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to the widespread adoption of AI-powered coding assistants integrated into a development environment. On one hand, low-latency code completion offers completion suggestions but is fundamentally constrained to the cursor's current position. On the other hand, chat-based editing can perform complex modifications, yet forces developers to stop their work, describe the intent in natural language, which causes a context-switch away from the code. This creates a suboptimal user experience, as neither paradigm proactively predicts the developer's next edit in a sequence of related edits. To bridge this gap and provide the seamless code edit suggestion, we introduce the task of Next Edit Prediction, a novel task designed to infer developer intent from recent interaction history to predict both the location and content of the subsequent edit. Specifically, we curate a high-quality supervised fine-tuning dataset and an evaluation benchmark for the Next Edit Prediction task. Then, we conduct supervised fine-tuning on a series of models and performed a comprehensive evaluation of both the fine-tuned models and other baseline models, yielding several novel findings. This work lays the foundation for a new interaction paradigm that proactively collaborate with developers by anticipating their following action, rather than merely reacting to explicit instructions.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Cancer is recognized as a complex group of diseases, contributing to the highest global mortality rates, with increasing prevalence and a trend toward affecting younger populations. It is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells, invasion of adjacent tissues, and metastasis to distant organs. Garcinia cowa, a traditional medicinal plant widely used in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, is employed to treat fever, cough, indigestion, as a laxative, and for parasitic diseases. Numerous xanthone compounds isolated from this species exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities, with some showing promise as anti cancer and antimalarial agents. Network pharmacology analysis successfully identified key bioactive compounds Rubraxanthone, Garcinone D, Norcowanin, Cowanol, and Cowaxanthone alongside their primary protein targets (TNF, CTNNB1, SRC, NFKB1, and MTOR), providing critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying their anti-cancer effects. The Graph Attention Network algorithm demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving an R2 of 0.98 and an RMSE of 0.02 after data augmentation, highlighting its accuracy in predicting pIC50 values for xanthone based compounds. Additionally, molecular docking revealed MTOR as a potential target for inducing cytotoxicity in HeLa cancer cells from Garcinia cowa.

Abstract: Cloud detection is essential for atmospheric retrievals, climate studies, and weather forecasting. We analyze infrared radiances from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) onboard Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellites to classify scenes as clear or cloudy.
  We apply the Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, based on kernel methods for non-separable data. In this study, the method is implemented for Cloud Identification (CISVM) to classify the test set using radiances or brightness temperatures, with dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and cloud-sensitive channel selection to focus on the most informative features. Our best configuration achieves 88.30 percent agreement with reference labels and shows strong consistency with cloud masks from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with the largest discrepancies in polar regions due to sensor differences.
  These results demonstrate that CISVM is a robust, flexible, and efficient method for automated cloud classification from infrared radiances, suitable for operational retrievals and future missions such as Far infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring (FORUM), the ninth European Space Agency Earth Explorer Mission.

Abstract: Prediction-powered inference (PPI) is a recent framework for valid statistical inference with partially labeled data, combining model-based predictions on a large unlabeled set with bias correction from a smaller labeled subset. We show that PPI can be extended to handle informative labeling by replacing its unweighted bias-correction term with an inverse probability weighted (IPW) version, using the classical Horvitz--Thompson or H\'ajek forms. This connection unites design-based survey sampling ideas with modern prediction-assisted inference, yielding estimators that remain valid when labeling probabilities vary across units. We consider the common setting where the inclusion probabilities are not known but estimated from a correctly specified model. In simulations, the performance of IPW-adjusted PPI with estimated propensities closely matches the known-probability case, retaining both nominal coverage and the variance-reduction benefits of PPI.

Abstract: Neural decoding of pathological and physiological states can enable patient-individualized closed-loop neuromodulation therapy. Recent advances in pre-trained large-scale foundation models offer the potential for generalized state estimation without patient-individual training. Here we present a foundation model trained on chronic longitudinal deep brain stimulation recordings spanning over 24 days. Adhering to long time-scale symptom fluctuations, we highlight the extended context window of 30 minutes. We present an optimized pre-training loss function for neural electrophysiological data that corrects for the frequency bias of common masked auto-encoder loss functions due to the 1-over-f power law. We show in a downstream task the decoding of Parkinson's disease symptoms with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation without patient-individual training.

Abstract: Shelf seas are important for carbon sequestration and carbon cycle, but available in situ, or satellite data for carbon pools in the shelf sea environment are often sparse, or highly uncertain. Alternative can be provided by reanalyses, but these are often expensive to run. We propose to use an ensemble of neural networks (NN) to learn from a coupled physics-biogeochemistry model the relationship between the directly observable variables and carbon pools. We demonstrate for North-West European Shelf (NWES) sea environment, that when the NN trained on a model free run simulation is applied to the NWES reanalysis, it is capable to reproduce the reanalysis outputs for carbon pools. Moreover, unlike the existing NWES reanalysis, the NN ensemble is also capable to provide uncertainty information for the pools. We focus on explainability of the results and demonstrate potential use of the NNs for future climate what-if scenarios. We suggest that model-informed machine learning presents a viable alternative to expensive reanalyses and could complement observational data, wherever they are missing and/or highly uncertain.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ) dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8 categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation, (ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and (iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low resource settings.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual, nonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input contexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors, {confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed prompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent paraphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts and answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine dialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure the semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score, $\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a Faithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence KL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors. These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous, confident confabulation.

Abstract: Machine unlearning work assumes a static, i.i.d training environment that doesn't truly exist. Modern ML pipelines need to learn, unlearn, and predict continuously on production streams of data. We translate the notion of the batch unlearning scenario to the online setting using notions of regret, sample complexity, and deletion capacity. We further tighten regret bounds to a logarithmic $\mathcal{O}(\ln{T})$, a first for a machine unlearning algorithm. And we swap out an expensive Hessian inversion with online variant of L-BFGS optimization, removing a memory footprint that scales linearly with time. Such changes extend the lifespan of an ML model before expensive retraining, making for a more efficient unlearning process.

Abstract: Traditional models for pricing catastrophe (CAT) bonds struggle to capture the complex, relational data inherent in these instruments. This paper introduces CATNet, a novel framework that applies a geometric deep learning architecture, the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN), to model the CAT bond primary market as a graph, leveraging its underlying network structure for spread prediction. Our analysis reveals that the CAT bond market exhibits the characteristics of a scale-free network, a structure dominated by a few highly connected and influential hubs. CATNet demonstrates high predictive performance, significantly outperforming a strong Random Forest benchmark. The inclusion of topological centrality measures as features provides a further, significant boost in accuracy. Interpretability analysis confirms that these network features are not mere statistical artifacts; they are quantitative proxies for long-held industry intuition regarding issuer reputation, underwriter influence, and peril concentration. This research provides evidence that network connectivity is a key determinant of price, offering a new paradigm for risk assessment and proving that graph-based models can deliver both state-of-the-art accuracy and deeper, quantifiable market insights.

Finally, we generalize the theorem to R\'enyi information measures, revealing a deep connection between the conditional R\'enyi divergence and the conditional Sibson's mutual information.

Abstract: Children's speech presents challenges for age and gender classification due to high variability in pitch, articulation, and developmental traits. While self-supervised learning (SSL) models perform well on adult speech tasks, their ability to encode speaker traits in children remains underexplored. This paper presents a detailed layer-wise analysis of four Wav2Vec2 variants using the PFSTAR and CMU Kids datasets. Results show that early layers (1-7) capture speaker-specific cues more effectively than deeper layers, which increasingly focus on linguistic information. Applying PCA further improves classification, reducing redundancy and highlighting the most informative components. The Wav2Vec2-large-lv60 model achieves 97.14% (age) and 98.20% (gender) on CMU Kids; base-100h and large-lv60 models reach 86.05% and 95.00% on PFSTAR. These results reveal how speaker traits are structured across SSL model depth and support more targeted, adaptive strategies for child-aware speech interfaces.

Abstract: This paper describes the solutions of the Dianping-Trust-Safety team for the META CRAG-MM challenge. The challenge requires building a comprehensive retrieval-augmented generation system capable for multi-modal multi-turn question answering. The competition consists of three tasks: (1) answering questions using structured data retrieved from an image-based mock knowledge graph, (2) synthesizing information from both knowledge graphs and web search results, and (3) handling multi-turn conversations that require context understanding and information aggregation from multiple sources. For Task 1, our solution is based on the vision large language model, enhanced by supervised fine-tuning with knowledge distilled from GPT-4.1. We further applied curriculum learning strategies to guide reinforcement learning, resulting in improved answer accuracy and reduced hallucination. For Task 2 and Task 3, we additionally leveraged web search APIs to incorporate external knowledge, enabling the system to better handle complex queries and multi-turn conversations. Our approach achieved 1st place in Task 1 with a significant lead of 52.38\%, and 3rd place in Task 3, demonstrating the effectiveness of the integration of curriculum learning with reinforcement learning in our training pipeline.

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+ benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method, showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and +1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

Abstract: Fine-tuning foundation models is critical for superior performance on personalized downstream tasks, compared to using pre-trained models. Collaborative learning can leverage local clients' datasets for fine-tuning, but limited client data and heterogeneous data distributions hinder effective collaboration. To address the challenge, we propose a flexible personalized federated learning paradigm that enables clients to engage in collaborative learning while maintaining personalized objectives. Given the limited and heterogeneous computational resources available on clients, we introduce \textbf{flexible personalized split federated learning (FlexP-SFL)}. Based on split learning, FlexP-SFL allows each client to train a portion of the model locally while offloading the rest to a server, according to resource constraints. Additionally, we propose an alignment strategy to improve personalized model performance on global data. Experimental results show that FlexP-SFL outperforms baseline models in personalized fine-tuning efficiency and final accuracy.

Abstract: Ranking product recommendations to optimize for a high click-through rate (CTR) or for high conversion, such as add-to-cart rate (ACR) and Order-Submit-Rate (OSR, view-to-purchase conversion) are standard practices in e-commerce. Optimizing for CTR appears like a straightforward choice: Training data (i.e., click data) are simple to collect and often available in large quantities. Additionally, CTR is used far beyond e-commerce, making it a generalist, easily implemented option. ACR and OSR, on the other hand, are more directly linked to a shop's business goals, such as the Gross Merchandise Value (GMV). In this paper, we compare the effects of using either of these objectives using an online A/B test. Among our key findings, we demonstrate that in our shops, optimizing for OSR produces a GMV uplift more than five times larger than when optimizing for CTR, without sacrificing new product discovery. Our results also provide insights into the different feature importances for each of the objectives.

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation, analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace. In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths, then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+ tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning.

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However, real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions, largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes. To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper, we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math 2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising generalization in mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Speech enhancement using artificial neural networks aims to remove noise from noisy speech signals while preserving the speech content. However, speech enhancement networks often introduce distortions to the speech signal, referred to as artifacts, which can degrade audio quality. In this work, we propose a post-processing neural network designed to mitigate artifacts introduced by speech enhancement models. Inspired by the analogy of making a `Putt' after an `Approach' in golf, we name our model PuttNet. We demonstrate that alternating between a speech enhancement model and the proposed Putt model leads to improved speech quality, as measured by perceptual quality scores (PESQ), objective intelligibility (STOI), and background noise intrusiveness (CBAK) scores. Furthermore, we illustrate with graphical analysis why this alternating Approach outperforms repeated application of either model alone.

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone. Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans (DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with 2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection, classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the built environment.

Abstract: We present a multi-head vision transformer approach for multi-label plant species prediction in vegetation plot images, addressing the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge. The task involves training models on single-species plant images while testing on multi-species quadrat images, creating a drastic domain shift. Our methodology leverages a pre-trained DINOv2 Vision Transformer Base (ViT-B/14) backbone with multiple classification heads for species, genus, and family prediction, utilizing taxonomic hierarchies. Key contributions include multi-scale tiling to capture plants at different scales, dynamic threshold optimization based on mean prediction length, and ensemble strategies through bagging and Hydra model architectures. The approach incorporates various inference techniques including image cropping to remove non-plant artifacts, top-n filtering for prediction constraints, and logit thresholding strategies. Experiments were conducted on approximately 1.4 million training images covering 7,806 plant species. Results demonstrate strong performance, making our submission 3rd best on the private leaderboard. Our code is available at https://github.com/geranium12/plant-clef-2025/tree/v1.0.0.

Abstract: Real-world trajectories are often sparse with low-sampling rates (i.e., long intervals between consecutive GPS points) and misaligned with road networks, yet many applications demand high-quality data for optimal performance. To improve data quality with sparse trajectories as input, we systematically study two related research problems: trajectory recovery on road network, which aims to infer missing points to recover high-sampling trajectories, and map matching, which aims to map GPS points to road segments to determine underlying routes. In this paper, we present efficient methods TRMMA and MMA for accurate trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, where MMA serves as the first step of TRMMA. In MMA, we carefully formulate a classification task to map a GPS point from sparse trajectories to a road segment over a small candidate segment set, rather than the entire road network. We develop techniques in MMA to generate effective embeddings that capture the patterns of GPS data, directional information, and road segments, to accurately align sparse trajectories to routes. For trajectory recovery, TRMMA focuses on the segments in the route returned by MMA to infer missing points with position ratios on road segments, producing high-sampling trajectories efficiently by avoiding evaluation of all road segments. Specifically, in TRMMA, we design a dual-transformer encoding process to cohesively capture latent patterns in trajectories and routes, and an effective decoding technique to sequentially predict the position ratios and road segments of missing points. We conduct extensive experiments to compare TRMMA and MMA with numerous existing methods for trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, on 4 large real-world datasets. TRMMA and MMA consistently achieve the best result quality, often by a significant margin.

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i) black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step, safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs, pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal medical agentic systems.

Abstract: Monitoring the degradation state of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) modules is essential for ensuring the reliability and longevity of power electronic systems, especially in safety-critical and high-performance applications. However, direct measurement of key degradation indicators - such as junction temperature, solder fatigue or delamination - remains challenging due to the physical inaccessibility of internal components and the harsh environment. In this context, machine learning-based virtual sensing offers a promising alternative by bridging the gap from feasible sensor placement to the relevant but inaccessible locations. This paper explores the feasibility of estimating the degradation state of solder layers, and the corresponding full temperature maps based on a limited number of physical sensors. Based on synthetic data of a specific degradation mode, we obtain a high accuracy in the estimation of the degraded solder area (1.17% mean absolute error), and are able to reproduce the surface temperature of the IGBT with a maximum relative error of 4.56% (corresponding to an average relative error of 0.37%).

Abstract: To leverage the potential computational speedup of quantum computing (QC), research in quantum machine learning (QML) has gained increasing prominence. Angle encoding techniques in QML models have been shown to generate truncated Fourier series, offering asymptotically universal function approximation capabilities. By selecting efficient feature maps (FMs) within quantum circuits, one can leverage the exponential growth of Fourier frequencies for improved approximation. In multi-dimensional settings, additional input dimensions induce further exponential scaling via mixed frequencies. In practice, however, quantum models frequently fail at regression tasks. Through two white-box experiments, we show that such failures can occur even when the relevant frequencies are present, due to an insufficient number of trainable parameters.
  In order to mitigate the double-exponential parameter growth resulting from double-exponentially growing frequencies, we propose frequency selection and dimensional separation as techniques to constrain the number of parameters, thereby improving trainability. By restricting the QML model to essential frequencies and permitting mixed frequencies only among feature dimensions with known interdependence, we expand the set of tractable problems on current hardware. We demonstrate the reduced parameter requirements by fitting two white-box functions with known frequency spectrum and dimensional interdependencies that could not be fitted with the default methods. The reduced parameter requirements permit us to perform training on a noisy quantum simulator and to demonstrate inference on real quantum hardware.

Abstract: Inverse scattering problems are critical in electromagnetic imaging and medical diagnostics but are challenged by their nonlinearity and diverse measurement scenarios. This paper proposes a physics-informed deep contrast source inversion framework (DeepCSI) for fast and accurate medium reconstruction across various measurement conditions. Inspired by contrast source inversion (CSI) and neural operator methods, a residual multilayer perceptron (ResMLP) is employed to model current distributions in the region of interest under different transmitter excitations, effectively linearizing the nonlinear inverse scattering problem and significantly reducing the computational cost of traditional full-waveform inversion. By modeling medium parameters as learnable tensors and utilizing a hybrid loss function that integrates state equation loss, data equation loss, and total variation regularization, DeepCSI establishes a fully differentiable framework for joint optimization of network parameters and medium properties. Compared with conventional methods, DeepCSI offers advantages in terms of simplicity and universal modeling capabilities for diverse measurement scenarios, including phase-less and multi-frequency observation. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that DeepCSI achieves high-precision, robust reconstruction under full-data, phaseless data, and multifrequency conditions, outperforming traditional CSI methods and providing an efficient and universal solution for complex inverse scattering problems.

Abstract: In Affective Computing, a key challenge lies in reliably linking subjective emotional experiences with objective physiological markers. This preliminary study addresses the issue of reproducibility by identifying physiological features from cardiovascular and electrodermal signals that are associated with continuous self-reports of arousal levels. Using the Continuously Annotated Signal of Emotion dataset, we analyzed 164 features extracted from cardiac and electrodermal signals of 30 participants exposed to short emotion-evoking videos. Feature selection was performed using the Terminating-Random Experiments (T-Rex) method, which performs variable selection systematically controlling a user-defined target False Discovery Rate. Remarkably, among all candidate features, only two electrodermal-derived features exhibited reproducible and statistically significant associations with arousal, achieving a 100\% confirmation rate. These results highlight the necessity of rigorous reproducibility assessments in physiological features selection, an aspect often overlooked in Affective Computing. Our approach is particularly promising for applications in safety-critical environments requiring trustworthy and reliable white box models, such as mental disorder recognition and human-robot interaction systems.

Abstract: Effective incident response (IR) is critical for mitigating cyber threats, yet security teams are overwhelmed by alert fatigue, high false-positive rates, and the vast volume of unstructured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) documents. While CTI holds immense potential for enriching security operations, its extensive and fragmented nature makes manual analysis time-consuming and resource-intensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance IR by integrating dynamically retrieved CTI. Our approach introduces a hybrid retrieval mechanism that combines NLP-based similarity searches within a CTI vector database with standardized queries to external CTI platforms, facilitating context-aware enrichment of security alerts. The augmented intelligence is then leveraged by an LLM-powered response generation module, which formulates precise, actionable, and contextually relevant incident mitigation strategies. We propose a dual evaluation paradigm, wherein automated assessment using an auxiliary LLM is systematically cross-validated by cybersecurity experts. Empirical validation on real-world and simulated alerts demonstrates that our approach enhances the accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency of IR, alleviating analyst workload and reducing response latency. This work underscores the potential of LLM-driven CTI fusion in advancing autonomous security operations and establishing a foundation for intelligent, adaptive cybersecurity frameworks.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory, processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target classification is possible.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic band structures in two-dimensional materials remains a fundamental challenge, with existing methods struggling to balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy. We present the Symmetry-Constrained Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural Network (SCMS-PINN) v35, which directly learns graphene band structures while rigorously enforcing crystallographic symmetries through a multi-head architecture. Our approach introduces three specialized ResNet-6 pathways -- K-head for Dirac physics, M-head for saddle points, and General head for smooth interpolation -- operating on 31 physics-informed features extracted from k-points. Progressive Dirac constraint scheduling systematically increases the weight parameter from 5.0 to 25.0, enabling hierarchical learning from global topology to local critical physics. Training on 10,000 k-points over 300 epochs achieves 99.99\% reduction in training loss (34.597 to 0.003) with validation loss of 0.0085. The model predicts Dirac point gaps within 30.3 $\mu$eV of theoretical zero and achieves average errors of 53.9 meV (valence) and 40.5 meV (conduction) across the Brillouin zone. All twelve C$_{6v}$ operations are enforced through systematic averaging, guaranteeing exact symmetry preservation. This framework establishes a foundation for extending physics-informed learning to broader two-dimensional materials for accelerated discovery.

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD, which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing, where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers. Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent. A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and generating actionable feedback.

<title>Memorisation and forgetting in a learning Hopfield neural network: bifurcation mechanisms, attractors and basins</title>

Abstract: Despite explosive expansion of artificial intelligence based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), these are employed as "black boxes'', as it is unclear how, during learning, they form memories or develop unwanted features, including spurious memories and catastrophic forgetting. Much research is available on isolated aspects of learning ANNs, but due to their high dimensionality and non-linearity, their comprehensive analysis remains a challenge. In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in attractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we comprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield network undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to formation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show that, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce a pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new attractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an abrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful learning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point attractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles. With this, memorisation and forgetting represent two manifestations of the same mechanism. Our strategy to analyse high-dimensional learning ANNs is universal and applicable to recurrent ANNs of any form. The demonstrated mechanisms of memory formation and of catastrophic forgetting shed light on the operation of a wider class of recurrent ANNs and could aid the development of approaches to mitigate their flaws.

<title>Video-BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation</title>

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM) that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a 50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from 0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

<title>Parity Cross-Resonance: A Multiqubit Gate</title>

Abstract: We present a native three-qubit entangling gate that exploits engineered interactions to realize control-control-target and control-target-target operations in a single coherent step. Unlike conventional decompositions into multiple two-qubit gates, our hybrid optimization approach selectively amplifies desired interactions while suppressing unwanted couplings, yielding robust performance across the computational subspace and beyond. The new gate can be classified as a cross-resonance gate. We show it can be utilized in several ways, for example, in GHZ triplet state preparation, Toffoli-class logic demonstrations with many-body interactions, and in implementing a controlled-ZZ gate. The latter maps the parity of two data qubits directly onto a measurement qubit, enabling faster and higher-fidelity stabilizer measurements in surface-code quantum error correction. In all these examples, we show that the three-qubit gate performance remains robust across Hilbert space sizes, as confirmed by testing under increasing total excitation numbers. This work lays the foundation for co-designing circuit architectures and control protocols that leverage native multiqubit interactions as core elements of next-generation superconducting quantum processors.

Abstract: Plant diseases are a major threat to food security globally. It is important to develop early detection systems which can accurately detect. The advancement in computer vision techniques has the potential to solve this challenge. We have developed a mobile-friendly solution which can accurately classify 101 plant diseases across 33 crops. We built a comprehensive dataset by combining different datasets, Plant Doc, PlantVillage, and PlantWild, all of which are for the same purpose. We evaluated performance across several lightweight architectures - MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3, MobileNetV3-Large, and EfficientNet-B0, B1 - specifically chosen for their efficiency on resource-constrained devices. The results were promising, with EfficientNet-B1 delivering our best performance at 94.7% classification accuracy. This architecture struck an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for real-world deployment on mobile devices.

<title>Accelerating exoplanet climate modelling: A machine learning approach to complement 3D GCM grid simulations</title>

Abstract: With the development of ever-improving telescopes capable of observing exoplanet atmospheres in greater detail and number, there is a growing demand for enhanced 3D climate models to support and help interpret observational data from space missions like CHEOPS, TESS, JWST, PLATO, and Ariel. However, the computationally intensive and time-consuming nature of general circulation models (GCMs) poses significant challenges in simulating a wide range of exoplanetary atmospheres. This study aims to determine whether machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used to predict the 3D temperature and wind structure of arbitrary tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets in a range of planetary parameters. A new 3D GCM grid with 60 inflated hot Jupiters orbiting A, F, G, K, and M-type host stars modelled with Exorad has been introduced. A dense neural network (DNN) and a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) are trained on this grid to predict local gas temperatures along with horizontal and vertical winds. To ensure the reliability and quality of the ML model predictions, WASP-121 b, HATS-42 b, NGTS-17 b, WASP-23 b, and NGTS-1 b-like planets, which are all targets for PLATO observation, are selected and modelled with ExoRad and the two ML methods as test cases. The DNN predictions for the gas temperatures are to such a degree that the calculated spectra agree within 32 ppm for all but one planet, for which only one single HCN feature reaches a 100 ppm difference. The developed ML emulators can reliably predict the complete 3D temperature field of an inflated warm to ultra-hot tidally locked Jupiter around A to M-type host stars. It provides a fast tool to complement and extend traditional GCM grids for exoplanet ensemble studies. The quality of the predictions is such that no or minimal effects on the gas phase chemistry, hence on the cloud formation and transmission spectra, are to be expected.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential as sequential decision-making agents, but their application is often limited due to a reliance on large, computationally expensive models. This creates a need to improve smaller models, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn interactions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks. To address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization (MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal Text-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP) frameworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative episode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm with a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show improves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a 3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate that the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our post-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on the Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a practical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating sequential decision-making agents using LLMs.

Abstract: Universal machine-learned potentials promise transferable accuracy across compositional and vibrational degrees of freedom, yet their application to biomolecular simulations remains underexplored. This work systematically evaluates equivariant message-passing architectures trained on the SPICE-v2 dataset with and without explicit long-range dispersion and electrostatics. We assess the impact of model size, training data composition, and electrostatic treatment across in- and out-of-distribution benchmark datasets, as well as molecular simulations of bulk liquid water, aqueous NaCl solutions, and biomolecules, including alanine tripeptide, the mini-protein Trp-cage, and Crambin. While larger models improve accuracy on benchmark datasets, this trend does not consistently extend to properties obtained from simulations. Predicted properties also depend on the composition of the training dataset. Long-range electrostatics show no systematic impact across systems. However, for Trp-cage, their inclusion yields increased conformational variability. Our results suggest that imbalanced datasets and immature evaluation practices currently challenge the applicability of universal machine-learned potentials to biomolecular simulations.

<title>CrossDenoise: Denoising Implicit Feedback via a Lightweight Entity-Aware Synergistic Framework</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10851</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.10851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems heavily rely on implicit feedback, which is inherently noisy due to false positives and negatives, severely degrading recommendation accuracy. Existing denoising strategies often overlook entity-aware modeling, suffer from high computational overhead, or demand excessive hyperparameter tuning, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose CrossDenoise, a novel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by disentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific factors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity in user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation factors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average training losses. These are fused with interaction-level weights derived from an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of individual losses. This design is model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only two intuitive hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on ML-1M, Yelp, and Amazon-book datasets, across GMF, NeuMF, and CDAE backbones, demonstrate that CrossDenoise consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. For instance, it achieves up to 27.01% NDCG@50 gain on Yelp with NeuMF, while incurring negligible computational and memory overhead. Our analysis confirms that CrossDenoise effectively separates clean from noisy samples and remains robust under varied hyperparameter settings. It offers a practical and scalable solution for denoising implicit feedback.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods. Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism, caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research directions to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: Given $n$ i.i.d. random matrices $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ that share a common expectation $\Sigma$, the objective of Differentially Private Stochastic PCA is to identify a subspace of dimension $k$ that captures the largest variance directions of $\Sigma$, while preserving differential privacy (DP) of each individual $A_i$. Existing methods either (i) require the sample size $n$ to scale super-linearly with dimension $d$, even under Gaussian assumptions on the $A_i$, or (ii) introduce excessive noise for DP even when the intrinsic randomness within $A_i$ is small. Liu et al. (2022a) addressed these issues for sub-Gaussian data but only for estimating the top eigenvector ($k=1$) using their algorithm DP-PCA. We propose the first algorithm capable of estimating the top $k$ eigenvectors for arbitrary $k \leq d$, whilst overcoming both limitations above. For $k=1$ our algorithm matches the utility guarantees of DP-PCA, achieving near-optimal statistical error even when $n = \tilde{\!O}(d)$. We further provide a lower bound for general $k > 1$, matching our upper bound up to a factor of $k$, and experimentally demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm over comparable baselines.

Abstract: This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance using four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of thumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters and their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to help serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of study. The influence of various parameter selections and their value adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on the performance of Echo State Network.

Abstract: A widely used algorithm for transfer learning is fine-tuning, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a target task with a small amount of labeled data. When the capacity of the pre-trained model is significantly larger than the size of the target dataset, fine-tuning is prone to overfitting and memorizing the training labels. Hence, a crucial question is to regularize fine-tuning and ensure its robustness against noise. To address this question, we begin by analyzing the generalization properties of fine-tuning. We present a PAC-Bayes generalization bound that depends on the distance traveled in each layer during fine-tuning and the noise stability of the fine-tuned model. We empirically measure these quantities. Based on the analysis, we propose regularized self-labeling -- the interpolation between regularization and self-labeling methods, including (i) layer-wise regularization to constrain the distance traveled in each layer; (ii) self-label-correction and label-reweighting to correct mislabeled data points (that the model is confident) and reweight less confident data points. We validate our approach on an extensive collection of image and text datasets using multiple pre-trained model architectures. Our approach improves baseline methods by 1.76% (on average) for seven image classification tasks and 0.75% for a few-shot classification task. When the target data set includes noisy labels, our approach outperforms baseline methods by an average of 3.56% in two noisy settings.

<title>Learning to Schedule in Parallel-Server Queues with Stochastic Bilinear Rewards</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of scheduling in multi-class, parallel-server queuing systems with uncertain rewards from job-server assignments. In this scenario, jobs incur holding costs while awaiting completion, and job-server assignments yield observable stochastic rewards with unknown mean values. The mean rewards for job-server assignments are assumed to follow a bilinear model with respect to features that characterize jobs and servers. Our objective is to minimize regret by maximizing the cumulative reward of job-server assignments over a time horizon, while keeping the total job holding cost bounded to ensure the stability of the queueing system. This problem is motivated by applications requiring resource allocation in network systems. In this problem, it is essential to control the tradeoff between reward maximization and fair allocation for the stability of the underlying queuing system (i.e., maximizing network throughput). To address this problem, we propose a scheduling algorithm based on a weighted proportional fair criteria augmented with marginal costs for reward maximization, incorporating a bandit algorithm tailored for bilinear rewards. Our algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret bound and a sub-linear mean holding cost (and queue length bound) of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$, respectively, with respect to the time horizon $T$, thus guaranteeing queuing system stability. Additionally, we establish stability conditions for distributed iterative algorithms for computing allocations, which are relevant to large-scale system applications. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm through numerical experiments.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning excels at learning representations from large amounts of data. At the same time, generative models offer the complementary property of learning information about the underlying data generation process. In this study, we aim at establishing a principled connection between these two paradigms and highlight the benefits of their complementarity. In particular, we perform an analysis of self-supervised learning objectives, elucidating the underlying probabilistic graphical models and presenting a standardized methodology for their derivation from first principles. The analysis suggests a natural means of integrating self-supervised learning with likelihood-based generative models. We instantiate this concept within the realm of cluster-based self-supervised learning and energy models, introducing a lower bound proven to reliably penalize the most important failure modes and unlocking full unification. Our theoretical findings are substantiated through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, demonstrating that our objective function allows to jointly train a backbone network in a discriminative and generative fashion, consequently outperforming existing self-supervised learning strategies in terms of clustering, generation and out-of-distribution detection performance by a wide margin. We also demonstrate that the solution can be integrated into a neuro-symbolic framework to tackle a simple yet non-trivial instantiation of the symbol grounding problem. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/emsansone/GEDI.

Abstract: Phishing email is a serious cyber threat that tries to deceive users by sending false emails with the intention of stealing confidential information or causing financial harm. Attackers, often posing as trustworthy entities, exploit technological advancements and sophistication to make detection and prevention of phishing more challenging. Despite extensive academic research, phishing detection remains an ongoing and formidable challenge in the cybersecurity landscape. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Masked Language Models (MLMs) possess immense potential to offer innovative solutions to address long-standing challenges. In this research paper, we present an optimized, fine-tuned transformer-based DistilBERT model designed for the detection of phishing emails. In the detection process, we work with a phishing email dataset and utilize the preprocessing techniques to clean and solve the imbalance class issues. Through our experiments, we found that our model effectively achieves high accuracy, demonstrating its capability to perform well. Finally, we demonstrate our fine-tuned model using Explainable-AI (XAI) techniques such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Transformer Interpret to explain how our model makes predictions in the context of text classification for phishing emails.

Abstract: Methods with adaptive stepsizes, such as AdaGrad and Adam, are essential for training modern Deep Learning models, especially Large Language Models. Typically, the noise in the stochastic gradients is heavy-tailed for the later ones. Gradient clipping provably helps to achieve good high-probability convergence for such noises. However, despite the similarity between AdaGrad/Adam and Clip-SGD, the current understanding of the high-probability convergence of AdaGrad/Adam-type methods is limited in this case. In this work, we prove that AdaGrad/Adam (and their delayed version) can have provably bad high-probability convergence if the noise is heavy-tailed. We also show that gradient clipping fixes this issue, i.e., we derive new high-probability convergence bounds with polylogarithmic dependence on the confidence level for AdaGrad-Norm and Adam-Norm with clipping and with/without delay for smooth convex/non-convex stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed noise. We extend our results to the case of AdaGrad/Adam with delayed stepsizes. Our empirical evaluations highlight the superiority of clipped versions of AdaGrad/Adam in handling the heavy-tailed noise.

Abstract: We study contextual dynamic pricing, where a decision maker posts personalized prices based on observable contexts and receives binary purchase feedback indicating whether the customer's valuation exceeds the price. Each valuation is modeled as an unknown latent function of the context, corrupted by independent and identically distributed market noise from an unknown distribution. Relying only on Lipschitz continuity of the noise distribution and bounded valuations, we propose a minimax-optimal algorithm. To accommodate the unknown distribution, our method discretizes the relevant noise range to form a finite set of candidate prices, then applies layered data partitioning to obtain confidence bounds substantially tighter than those derived via the elliptical-potential lemma. A key advantage is that estimation bias in the valuation function cancels when comparing upper confidence bounds, eliminating the need to know the Lipschitz constant. The framework extends beyond linear models to general function classes through offline regression oracles. Our regret analysis depends solely on the oracle's estimation error, typically governed by the statistical complexity of the class. These techniques yield a regret upper bound matching the minimax lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, we refine these guarantees under additional structures -- e.g., linear valuation models, second-order smoothness, sparsity, and known noise distribution or observable valuations -- and compare our bounds and assumptions with prior dynamic-pricing methods. Finally, numerical experiments corroborate the theory and show clear improvements over benchmark methods.

Abstract: The performance of the standard Online Robust Principal Component Analysis (OR-PCA) technique depends on the optimum tuning of the explicit regularizers and this tuning is dataset sensitive. We aim to remove the dependency on these tuning parameters by using implicit regularization. We propose to use the implicit regularization effect of various modified gradient descents to make OR-PCA tuning free. Our method incorporates three different versions of modified gradient descent that separately but naturally encourage sparsity and low-rank structures in the data. The proposed method performs comparable or better than the tuned OR-PCA for both simulated and real-world datasets. Tuning-free ORPCA makes it more scalable for large datasets since we do not require dataset-dependent parameter tuning.

Abstract: We show that feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation generalize on low complexity data, suitably defined. Given i.i.d.~data generated from a simple programming language, the minimum description length (MDL) feedforward neural network which interpolates the data generalizes with high probability. We define this simple programming language, along with a notion of description length of such networks. We provide several examples on basic computational tasks, such as checking primality of a natural number. For primality testing, our theorem shows the following and more. Suppose that we draw an i.i.d.~sample of $n$ numbers uniformly at random from $1$ to $N$. For each number $x_i$, let $y_i = 1$ if $x_i$ is a prime and $0$ if it is not. Then, the interpolating MDL network accurately answers, with error probability $1- O((\ln N)/n)$, whether a newly drawn number between $1$ and $N$ is a prime or not. Note that the network is not designed to detect primes; minimum description learning discovers a network which does so. Extensions to noisy data are also discussed, suggesting that MDL neural network interpolators can demonstrate tempered overfitting.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) has shown promise in various applications (e.g. robot locomotion) but is often limited to learning a single expert policy, constraining behavior diversity and robustness in unpredictable real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce Quality Diversity Inverse Reinforcement Learning (QD-IRL), a novel framework that integrates quality-diversity optimization with IRL methods, enabling agents to learn diverse behaviors from limited demonstrations. This work introduces Extrinsic Behavioral Curiosity (EBC), which allows agents to receive additional curiosity rewards from an external critic based on how novel the behaviors are with respect to a large behavioral archive. To validate the effectiveness of EBC in exploring diverse locomotion behaviors, we evaluate our method on multiple robot locomotion tasks. EBC improves the performance of QD-IRL instances with GAIL, VAIL, and DiffAIL across all included environments by up to 185%, 42%, and 150%, even surpassing expert performance by 20% in Humanoid. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EBC is applicable to Gradient-Arborescence-based Quality Diversity Reinforcement Learning (QD-RL) algorithms, where it substantially improves performance and provides a generic technique for learning behavioral-diverse policies.

Abstract: Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has emerged as a powerful representation learning tool for graph-structured data. However, most approaches are tailored for undirected graphs, neglecting the abundant information in the edges of directed graphs (digraphs). In fact, digraphs are widely applied in the real world and confirmed to address heterophily challenges. Despite recent advancements, existing spatial- and spectral-based DiGNNs have limitations due to their complex learning mechanisms and reliance on high-quality topology, resulting in low efficiency and unstable performance. To address these issues, we propose Directed Random Walk (DiRW), a plug-and-play strategy for most spatial-based DiGNNs and also an innovative model which offers a new digraph learning paradigm. Specifically, it utilizes a direction-aware path sampler optimized from the perspectives of walk probability, length, and number in a weight-free manner by considering node profiles and topologies. Building upon this, DiRW incorporates a node-wise learnable path aggregator for generalized node representations. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that DiRW: (1) enhances most spatial-based methods as a plug-and-play strategy; (2) achieves SOTA performance as a new digraph learning paradigm. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/dhsiuu/DiRW.

Abstract: Spatial-temporal graph representations play a crucial role in urban sensing applications, including traffic analysis, human mobility behavior modeling, and citywide crime prediction. However, a key challenge lies in the noisy and sparse nature of spatial-temporal data, which limits existing neural networks' ability to learn meaningful region representations in the spatial-temporal graph. To overcome these limitations, we propose HGAurban, a novel heterogeneous spatial-temporal graph masked autoencoder that leverages generative self-supervised learning for robust urban data representation. Our framework introduces a spatial-temporal heterogeneous graph encoder that extracts region-wise dependencies from multi-source data, enabling comprehensive modeling of diverse spatial relationships. Within our self-supervised learning paradigm, we implement a masked autoencoder that jointly processes node features and graph structure. This approach automatically learns heterogeneous spatial-temporal patterns across regions, significantly improving the representation of dynamic temporal correlations. Comprehensive experiments across multiple spatiotemporal mining tasks demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods and robustly handles real-world urban data challenges, including noise and sparsity in both spatial and temporal dimensions.

<title>Multi-objective Optimization in CPU Design Space Exploration: Attention is All You Need</title>

Abstract: Design Space Exploration (DSE) is essential to modern CPU design, yet current frameworks struggle to scale and generalize in high-dimensional architectural spaces. As the dimensionality of design spaces continues to grow, existing DSE frameworks face three fundamental challenges: (1) reduced accuracy and poor scalability of surrogate models in large design spaces; (2) inefficient acquisition guided by hand-crafted heuristics or exhaustive search; (3) limited interpretability, making it hard to pinpoint architectural bottlenecks.
  In this work, we present \textbf{AttentionDSE}, the first end-to-end DSE framework that \emph{natively integrates} performance prediction and design guidance through an attention-based neural architecture. Unlike traditional DSE workflows that separate surrogate modeling from acquisition and rely heavily on hand-crafted heuristics, AttentionDSE establishes a unified, learning-driven optimization loop, in which attention weights serve a dual role: enabling accurate performance estimation and simultaneously exposing the performance bottleneck. This paradigm shift elevates attention from a passive representation mechanism to an active, interpretable driver of design decision-making.
  Key innovations include: (1) a \textbf{Perception-Driven Attention} mechanism that exploits architectural hierarchy and locality, scaling attention complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n)$ via sliding windows; (2) an \textbf{Attention-aware Bottleneck Analysis} that automatically surfaces critical parameters for targeted optimization, eliminating the need for domain-specific heuristics.
  Evaluated on high-dimensional CPU design space using the SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite, AttentionDSE achieves up to \textbf{3.9\% higher Pareto Hypervolume} and over \textbf{80\% reduction in exploration time} compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Distributed time series data presents a challenge for federated learning, as clients often possess different feature sets and have misaligned time steps. Existing federated time series models are limited by the assumption of perfect temporal or feature alignment across clients. In this paper, we propose FedTDD, a novel federated time series diffusion model that jointly learns a synthesizer across clients. At the core of FedTDD is a novel data distillation and aggregation framework that reconciles the differences between clients by imputing the misaligned timesteps and features. In contrast to traditional federated learning, FedTDD learns the correlation across clients' time series through the exchange of local synthetic outputs instead of model parameters. A coordinator iteratively improves a global distiller network by leveraging shared knowledge from clients through the exchange of synthetic data. As the distiller becomes more refined over time, it subsequently enhances the quality of the clients' local feature estimates, allowing each client to then improve its local imputations for missing data using the latest, more accurate distiller. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate FedTDD's effectiveness compared to centralized training, and the effectiveness of sharing synthetic outputs to transfer knowledge of local time series. Notably, FedTDD achieves 79.4% and 62.8% improvement over local training in Context-FID and Correlational scores.

Abstract: With the increase in the number of parameters in large language models, the process of pre-training and fine-tuning increasingly demands larger volumes of GPU memory. A significant portion of this memory is typically consumed by the optimizer state. To overcome this challenge, recent approaches such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA (Hu et al., 2021)), low-rank gradient projection (GaLore (Zhao et al., 2024)), and blockwise optimization (BAdam (Luo et al., 2024)) have been proposed. However, in all these algorithms, the $\textit{effective rank of the weight updates remains low-rank}$, which can lead to a substantial loss of information from the gradient. This loss can be critically important, especially during the pre-training stage. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{FRUGAL}$ ($\textbf{F}$ull-$\textbf{R}$ank $\textbf{U}$pdates with $\textbf{G}$r$\textbf{A}$dient sp$\textbf{L}$itting), a new memory-efficient optimization framework. $\texttt{FRUGAL}$ leverages gradient splitting to perform low-dimensional updates using advanced algorithms (such as Adam), while updates along the remaining directions are executed via state-free methods like SGD or signSGD (Bernstein et al., 2018). Our framework can be integrated with various low-rank update selection techniques, including GaLore and BAdam. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for our framework when using SGDM for low-dimensional updates and SGD for state-free updates. Additionally, our method consistently outperforms concurrent approaches across various fixed memory budgets, achieving state-of-the-art results in pre-training and fine-tuning tasks while balancing memory efficiency and performance metrics.

Abstract: Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Differentiable causal graphical models have been proposed to infer a gene regulatory network (GRN) from large scale interventional datasets, capturing the causal gene regulatory relationships from genetic perturbations. However, existing models are limited in their expressivity and scalability while failing to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a highly efficient approach for downstream tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources. However, applying LoRA techniques to quantized LLMs poses unique challenges due to the reduced representational precision of quantized weights. In this paper, we introduce CLoQ (Calibrated LoRA initialization for Quantized LLMs), a simplistic initialization strategy designed to overcome these challenges. Our approach focuses on minimizing the layer-wise discrepancy between the original LLM and its quantized counterpart with LoRA components during initialization. By leveraging a small calibration dataset, CLoQ quantizes a pre-trained LLM and determines the optimal LoRA components for each layer, ensuring a strong foundation for subsequent fine-tuning. A key contribution of this work is a novel theoretical result that enables the accurate and closed-form construction of these optimal LoRA components. We validate the efficacy of CLoQ across multiple tasks such as language generation, arithmetic reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms existing LoRA fine-tuning methods for quantized LLMs, especially at ultra low-bit widths.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance gains via scaling up model sizes and/or data. However, recent evidence suggests diminishing returns from such approaches, motivating scaling the computation spent at inference time. Existing inference-time scaling methods, usually with reward models, cast the task as a search problem, which tends to be vulnerable to reward hacking as a consequence of approximation errors in reward models. In this paper, we instead cast inference-time scaling as a probabilistic inference task and leverage sampling-based techniques to explore the typical set of the state distribution of a state-space model with an approximate likelihood, rather than optimize for its mode directly. We propose a novel inference-time scaling approach by adapting particle-based Monte Carlo methods to this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our methods have a 4-16x better scaling rate over our deterministic search counterparts on various challenging mathematical reasoning tasks. Using our approach, we show that Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct can surpass GPT-4o accuracy in only 4 rollouts, while Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct scales to o1 level accuracy in only 32 rollouts. Our work not only presents an effective method to inference-time scaling, but also connects the rich literature in probabilistic inference with inference-time scaling of LLMs to develop more robust algorithms in future work.

Abstract: In online advertising under the cost-per-conversion (CPA) model, accurate conversion rate (CVR) prediction is crucial. A major challenge is delayed feedback, where conversions may occur long after user interactions, leading to incomplete recent data and biased model training. Existing solutions partially mitigate this issue but often rely on auxiliary models, making them computationally inefficient and less adaptive to user interest shifts. We propose IF-DFM, an \underline{I}nfluence \underline{F}unction-empowered for \underline{D}elayed \underline{F}eedback \underline{M}odeling which estimates the impact of newly arrived and delayed conversions on model parameters, enabling efficient updates without full retraining. By reformulating the inverse Hessian-vector product as an optimization problem, IF-DFM achieves a favorable trade-off between scalability and effectiveness. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that IF-DFM outperforms prior methods in both accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: Distributed optimization has become the default training paradigm in modern machine learning due to the growing scale of models and datasets. To mitigate communication overhead, local updates are often applied before global aggregation, resulting in a nested optimization approach with inner and outer steps. However, heavy-tailed stochastic gradient noise remains a significant challenge, particularly in attention-based models, hindering effective training. In this work, we propose TailOPT, an efficient framework designed to address heavy-tailed noise by leveraging adaptive optimization or clipping techniques. We establish convergence guarantees for the TailOPT framework under heavy-tailed noise with potentially unbounded gradient variance and local updates. Among its variants, we highlight a memory and communication efficient instantiation which we call $Bi^2Clip$, which performs coordinate-wise clipping at both the inner and outer optimizers, achieving adaptive-like performance (e.g., Adam) without the cost of maintaining or transmitting additional gradient statistics. Empirically, TailOPT, including $Bi^2Clip$, demonstrates superior performance on several language tasks and models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The brain rapidly adapts to new contexts and learns from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms struggle to mimic. Inspired by the mechanical oscillatory rhythms of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm utilizing link strength oscillations, where learning is associated with the coordination of these oscillations. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, allowing the network to sense and adapt to subtle contextual changes without supervision. The network becomes a generalist AI architecture, capable of predicting dynamics of multiple contexts including unseen ones. These results make our paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of cognition. Because our paradigm is agnostic to specifics of the neural network, our study opens doors for introducing rapid adaptive learning into leading AI models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has demonstrated effectiveness in solving NP-complete (NPC) problems by learning discrete diffusion models for solution generation, eliminating hand-crafted domain knowledge. Despite their success, existing NCO methods face significant challenges in both cross-scale and cross-problem generalization, and high training costs compared to traditional solvers. While recent studies on diffusion models have introduced training-free guidance approaches that leverage pre-defined guidance functions for conditional generation, such methodologies have not been extensively explored in combinatorial optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free inference time adaptation framework (DIFU-Ada) that enables both the zero-shot cross-problem transfer and cross-scale generalization capabilities of diffusion-based NCO solvers without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical analysis that helps understanding the cross-problem transfer capability. Our experimental results demonstrate that a diffusion solver, trained exclusively on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), can achieve competitive zero-shot transfer performance across different problem scales on TSP variants, such as Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP) and the Orienteering Problem (OP), through inference time adaptation.

Abstract: Machine learning models play a key role for service providers looking to gain market share in consumer markets. However, traditional learning approaches do not take into account the existence of additional providers, who compete with each other for consumers. Our work aims to study learning in this market setting, as it affects providers, consumers, and the market itself. We begin by analyzing such markets through the lens of the learning objective, and show that accuracy cannot be the only consideration. We then propose a method for classification under competition, so that a learner can maximize market share in the presence of competitors. We show that our approach benefits the providers as well as the consumers, and find that the timing of market entry and model updates can be crucial. We display the effectiveness of our approach across a range of domains, from simple distributions to noisy datasets, and show that the market as a whole remains stable by converging quickly to an equilibrium.

Abstract: When learning is used to inform decisions about humans, such as for loans, hiring, or admissions, this can incentivize users to strategically modify their features, at a cost, to obtain positive predictions. The common assumption is that the function governing costs is exogenous, fixed, and predetermined. We challenge this assumption, and assert that costs can emerge as a result of deploying a classifier. Our idea is simple: when users seek positive predictions, this creates demand for important features; and if features are available for purchase, then a market will form, and competition will give rise to prices. We extend the strategic classification framework to support this notion, and study learning in a setting where a classifier can induce a market for features. We present an analysis of the learning task, devise an algorithm for computing market prices, propose a differentiable learning framework, and conduct experiments to explore our novel setting and approach.

Abstract: Policies generated by Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are difficult to explain to users, as they emerge from the interaction of complex reward structures and neural network representations. Consequently, analyzing and predicting agent behavior can be challenging, undermining user trust in real-world applications. To facilitate user understanding, current methods for global policy summarization typically rely on videos that demonstrate agent behavior in a subset of world states. However, users can only watch a limited number of demonstrations, constraining their understanding. Moreover, these methods place the burden of interpretation on users by presenting raw behaviors rather than synthesizing them into coherent patterns. To resolve these issues, we introduce SySLLM (Synthesized Summary using Large Language Models), advocating for a new paradigm of abstractive-textual policy explanations. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)-which possess extensive world knowledge and pattern synthesis capabilities-SySLLM generates textual summaries that provide structured and comprehensible explanations of agent policies. SySLLM demonstrates that LLMs can interpret spatio-temporally structured descriptions of state-action trajectories from an RL agent and generate valuable policy insights in a zero-shot setting, without any prior knowledge or fine-tuning. Our evaluation shows that SySLLM captures key insights, such as goal preferences and exploration strategies, that were also identified by human experts. Furthermore, in a large-scale user study (with 200 participants), SySLLM summaries were preferred over demonstration-based summaries (HIGHLIGHTS) by a clear majority (75.5%) of participants.

Abstract: Popular PEFT methods reduce trainable parameter count for fine-tuning by parameterizing new low-rank or sparse trainable weights in parallel to the frozen pre-trained weights $W$. However, these weights are trained from scratch, and there exists a performance gap between these methods and full fine-tuning, especially in low-budget settings. We introduce VectorFit, a new way of parameterization that efficiently utilizes the existing knowledge embedded in $W$ by adaptively training their singular vectors and biases. We show that utilizing the structural and transformational properties of $W$ in this way can lead to high-rank incremental weight matrices $\Delta W$, comparable to that of full fine-tuning. VectorFit delivers superior results with 9$\boldsymbol\times$ fewer trainable parameters than the leading PEFT methods. Through comprehensive experiments across 19 datasets covering a wide range of language and vision tasks such as natural language understanding and generation, question answering, image classification, and image generation, we demonstrate that VectorFit surpasses baselines in terms of performance as a function of parameter-efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is critical for safe and efficient autonomous driving, especially in mixed traffic environments when both human-driven and autonomous vehicles co-exist. However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness control mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance. The source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/cpraskoti/MIAT.

Abstract: As a new distributed graph learning paradigm, Federated Graph Learning (FGL) facilitates collaborative model training across local systems while preserving data privacy.
  We review existing FGL approaches and categorize their optimization mechanisms into:
  (1) Server-Client (S-C), where clients upload local model parameters for server-side aggregation and global updates;
  (2) Client-Client (C-C), which allows direct exchange of information between clients and customizing their local training process.
  We reveal that C-C shows superior potential due to its refined communication structure.
  However, existing C-C methods broadcast redundant node representations, incurring high communication costs and privacy risks at the node level. To this end, we propose FedC4, which combines graph Condensation with C-C Collaboration optimization. Specifically, FedC4 employs graph condensation technique to refine the knowledge of each client's graph into a few synthetic embeddings instead of transmitting node-level knowledge. Moreover, FedC4 introduces three novel modules that allow the source client to send distinct node representations tailored to the target client's graph properties. Experiments on eight public real-world datasets show that FedC4 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both task performance and communication cost. Our code is now available on https://github.com/Ereshkigal1/FedC4.

Abstract: Conventional time-series forecasting methods typically aim to minimize overall prediction error, without accounting for the varying importance of different forecast ranges in downstream applications. We propose a training methodology that enables forecasting models to adapt their focus to application-specific regions of interest at inference time, without retraining. The approach partitions the prediction space into fine-grained segments during training, which are dynamically reweighted and aggregated to emphasize the target range specified by the application. Unlike prior methods that predefine these ranges, our framework supports flexible, on-demand adjustments. Experiments on standard benchmarks and a newly collected wireless communication dataset demonstrate that our method not only improves forecast accuracy within regions of interest but also yields measurable gains in downstream task performance. These results highlight the potential for closer integration between predictive modeling and decision-making in real-world systems.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) systems increasingly operate in environments where devices must respond in real time while managing fluctuating resource constraints, including energy and bandwidth. Yet, current approaches often fall short in addressing scenarios where operational constraints evolve over time. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Budgeted Multi-Armed Bandit framework tailored for IoT applications with dynamic operational limits. Our model introduces a decaying violation budget, which permits limited constraint violations early in the learning process and gradually enforces stricter compliance over time. We present the Budgeted Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, which adaptively balances performance optimization and compliance with time-varying constraints. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that Budgeted UCB achieves sublinear regret and logarithmic constraint violations over the learning horizon. Extensive simulations in a wireless communication setting show that our approach achieves faster adaptation and better constraint satisfaction than standard online learning methods. These results highlight the framework's potential for building adaptive, resource-aware IoT systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face deployment challenges due to high computational costs, and while Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a solution, existing rotation-based methods struggle at very low bit-widths like 2-bit. We introduce a novel, training-free approach to construct an improved rotation matrix, addressing the limitations of current methods. The key contributions include leveraging the Walsh-Hadamard transform with sequency ordering, which clusters similar frequency components to reduce quantization error compared to standard Hadamard matrices, significantly improving performance. Furthermore, we propose a Grouped Sequency-arranged Rotation (GSR) using block-diagonal matrices with smaller Walsh blocks, effectively isolating outlier impacts and achieving performance comparable to optimization-based methods without requiring any training. Our method demonstrates robust performance on reasoning tasks and Perplexity (PPL) score on WikiText-2. Our method also enhances results even when applied over existing learned rotation techniques.

Abstract: In the last few decades, Machine Learning (ML) has achieved significant success across domains ranging from healthcare, sustainability, and the social sciences, to criminal justice and finance. But its deployment in increasingly sophisticated, critical, and sensitive areas affecting individuals, the groups they belong to, and society as a whole raises critical concerns around fairness, transparency and robustness, among others. As the complexity and scale of ML systems and of the settings in which they are deployed grow, so does the need for responsible ML methods that address these challenges while providing guaranteed performance in deployment.
  Mixed-integer optimization (MIO) offers a powerful framework for embedding responsible ML considerations directly into the learning process while maintaining performance. For example, it enables learning of inherently transparent models that can conveniently incorporate fairness or other domain specific constraints. This tutorial paper provides an accessible and comprehensive introduction to this topic discussing both theoretical and practical aspects. It outlines some of the core principles of responsible ML, their importance in applications, and the practical utility of MIO for building ML models that align with these principles. Through examples and mathematical formulations, it illustrates practical strategies and available tools for efficiently solving MIO problems for responsible ML. It concludes with a discussion on current limitations and open research questions, providing suggestions for future work.

Abstract: Telling apart the cause and effect between two random variables with purely observational data is a challenging problem that finds applications in various scientific disciplines. A key principle utilized in this task is the algorithmic Markov condition, which postulates that the joint distribution, when factorized according to the causal direction, yields a more succinct codelength compared to the anti-causal direction. Previous approaches approximate these codelengths by relying on simple functions or Gaussian processes (GPs) with easily evaluable complexity, compromising between model fitness and computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging the variational Bayesian learning of neural networks as an interpretation of the codelengths. This allows the improvement of model fitness, while maintaining the succinctness of the codelengths, and the avoidance of the significant computational complexity of the GP-based approaches. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks in cause-effect identification demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, showing promising performance enhancements on several datasets in comparison to most related methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.

Abstract: We extend the standard reinforcement learning framework to random time horizons. While the classical setting typically assumes finite and deterministic or infinite runtimes of trajectories, we argue that multiple real-world applications naturally exhibit random (potentially trajectory-dependent) stopping times. Since those stopping times typically depend on the policy, their randomness has an effect on policy gradient formulas, which we (mostly for the first time) derive rigorously in this work both for stochastic and deterministic policies. We present two complementary perspectives, trajectory or state-space based, and establish connections to optimal control theory. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that using the proposed formulas can significantly improve optimization convergence compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Actor-critic methods have been central to many of the recent advances in deep reinforcement learning. The most common approach is to use symmetric architectures, whereby both actor and critic have the same network topology and number of parameters. However, recent works have argued for the advantages of asymmetric setups, specifically with the use of smaller actors. We perform broad empirical investigations and analyses to better understand the implications of this and find that, in general, smaller actors result in performance degradation and overfit critics. Our analyses suggest poor data collection, due to value underestimation, as one of the main causes for this behavior, and further highlight the crucial role the critic can play in alleviating this pathology. We explore techniques to mitigate the observed value underestimation, which enables further research in asymmetric actor-critic methods.

Abstract: As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become increasingly prevalent in both consumer and defense applications, the need for reliable, modality-specific classification systems grows in urgency. This paper addresses the challenge of data scarcity in UAV audio classification by expanding on prior work through the integration of pre-trained deep learning models, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies, and targeted data augmentation techniques. Using a custom dataset of 3,100 UAV audio clips (15,500 seconds) spanning 31 distinct drone types, we evaluate the performance of transformer-based and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures under various fine-tuning configurations. Experiments were conducted with five-fold cross-validation, assessing accuracy, training efficiency, and robustness. Results show that full fine-tuning of the EfficientNet-B0 model with three augmentations achieved the highest validation accuracy (95.95), outperforming both the custom CNN and transformer-based models like AST. These findings suggest that combining lightweight architectures with PEFT and well-chosen augmentations provides an effective strategy for UAV audio classification on limited datasets. Future work will extend this framework to multimodal UAV classification using visual and radar telemetry.

Abstract: Multivariate time series data, collected across various fields such as manufacturing and wearable technology, exhibit states at multiple levels of granularity, from coarse-grained system behaviors to fine-grained, detailed events. Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states. PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns. Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and evolving time series dynamics.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models generate samples by learning to reverse a noise-injection process that transforms data into noise. A key development is the reformulation of the reverse sampling process as a deterministic probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE), which allows for efficient sampling using high-order numerical solvers. Unlike traditional time integrator analysis, the accuracy of this sampling procedure depends not only on numerical integration errors but also on the approximation quality and regularity of the learned score function, as well as their interaction. In this work, we present a rigorous convergence analysis of deterministic samplers derived from probability flow ODEs for general forward processes with arbitrary variance schedules. Specifically, we develop and analyze $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes, under the practical assumption that the first and second derivatives of the learned score function are bounded. We prove that the total variation distance between the generated and target distributions can be bounded as \begin{align*}
  O\bigl(d^{\frac{7}{4}}\varepsilon_{\text{score}}^{\frac{1}{2}} +d(dH_{\max})^p\bigr), \end{align*} where $\varepsilon^2_{\text{score}}$ denotes the $L^2$ error in the score function approximation, $d$ is the data dimension, and $H_{\max}$ represents the maximum solver step size. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets further confirm that the derivatives of the learned score function are bounded in practice.

Abstract: Masked Graph Auto-Encoder, a powerful graph self-supervised training paradigm, has recently shown superior performance in graph representation learning. Existing works typically rely on node contextual information to recover the masked information. However, they fail to generalize well to heterophilic graphs where connected nodes may be not similar, because they focus only on capturing the neighborhood information and ignoring the discrepancy information between different nodes, resulting in indistinguishable node representations. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE). It obtains more distinguishable node representations by reconstructing the discrepancy information of neighboring nodes during the masking process. We conduct extensive experiments on 17 widely-used benchmark datasets. The results show that our DGMAE can effectively preserve the discrepancies of nodes in low-dimensional space. Moreover, DGMAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph self-supervised learning methods on three graph analytic including tasks node classification, node clustering, and graph classification, demonstrating its remarkable superiority. The code of DGMAE is available at https://github.com/zhengziyu77/DGMAE.

Abstract: Graph representation learning on Analog-Mixed Signal (AMS) circuits is crucial for various downstream tasks, e.g., parasitic estimation. However, the scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (BMSE) and balanced softmax cross-entropy (BSCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the $R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification.

Abstract: High-quality training data is essential for building reliable and efficient machine learning systems. One-shot coreset selection addresses this by pruning the dataset while maintaining or even improving model performance, often relying on training-dynamics-based data difficulty scores. However, most existing methods implicitly assume class-wise homogeneity in data difficulty, overlooking variation in data difficulty across different classes. In this work, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such as network intrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often clusters by class. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and introduce the Class Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a quantitative measure. We demonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with performance degradation in class-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to overrepresent easy majority classes while neglecting rare but informative ones. To address this, we introduce class-proportional variants of multiple sampling strategies. Evaluated on five diverse datasets spanning security and medical domains, our methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. For instance, on CTU-13, at an extreme 99% pruning rate, a class-proportional variant of Coverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS-CP) shows remarkable stability, with accuracy dropping only 2.58%, precision 0.49%, and recall 0.19%. In contrast, the class-agnostic CCS baseline, the next best method, suffers sharper declines of 7.59% in accuracy, 4.57% in precision, and 4.11% in recall. We further show that aggressive pruning enhances generalization in noisy, imbalanced, and large-scale datasets. Our results underscore that explicitly modeling class-difficulty separability leads to more effective, robust, and generalizable data pruning, particularly in high-stakes scenarios.

Abstract: Denoiser models have become powerful tools for inverse problems, enabling the use of pretrained networks to approximate the score of a smoothed prior distribution. These models are often used in heuristic iterative schemes aimed at solving Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) optimisation problems, where the proximal operator of the negative log-prior plays a central role. In practice, this operator is intractable, and practitioners plug in a pretrained denoiser as a surrogate-despite the lack of general theoretical justification for this substitution. In this work, we show that a simple algorithm, closely related to several used in practice, provably converges to the proximal operator under a log-concavity assumption on the prior $p$. We show that this algorithm can be interpreted as a gradient descent on smoothed proximal objectives. Our analysis thus provides a theoretical foundation for a class of empirically successful but previously heuristic methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-agent ski-rental problem that generalizes the classical ski-rental dilemma to a group setting where agents incur individual and shared costs. In our model, each agent can either rent at a fixed daily cost, or purchase a pass at an individual cost, with an additional third option of a discounted group pass available to all. We consider scenarios in which agents' active days differ, leading to dynamic states as agents drop out of the decision process. To address this problem from different perspectives, we define three distinct competitive ratios: overall, state-dependent, and individual rational. For each objective, we design and analyze optimal deterministic and randomized policies. Our deterministic policies employ state-aware threshold functions that adapt to the dynamic states, while our randomized policies sample and resample thresholds from tailored state-aware distributions. The analysis reveals that symmetric policies, in which all agents use the same threshold, outperform asymmetric ones. Our results provide competitive ratio upper and lower bounds and extend classical ski-rental insights to multi-agent settings, highlighting both theoretical and practical implications for group decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM): an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated training datasets.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models, where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model), and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$, the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically, our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity $\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$ outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1) Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.

Abstract: Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods rely heavily on photometric and geometric consistency constraints, but newer machine learning-based MVS methods check geometric consistency across multiple source views only as a post-processing step. In this paper, we present a novel approach that explicitly encourages geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views at different scales during learning (see Fig. 1). We find that adding this geometric consistency loss significantly accelerates learning by explicitly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, reducing the training iteration requirements to nearly half that of other MVS methods. Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets, and competitive results on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, GC-MVSNet is the first attempt to enforce multi-view, multi-scale geometric consistency during learning.

Abstract: Finding the optimal solution is often the primary goal in combinatorial optimization (CO). However, real-world applications frequently require diverse solutions rather than a single optimum, particularly in two key scenarios. The first scenario occurs in real-world applications where strictly enforcing every constraint is neither necessary nor desirable. Allowing minor constraint violations can often lead to more cost-effective solutions. This is typically achieved by incorporating the constraints as penalty terms in the objective function, which requires careful tuning of penalty parameters. The second scenario involves cases where CO formulations tend to oversimplify complex real-world factors, such as domain knowledge, implicit trade-offs, or ethical considerations. To address these challenges, generating (i) penalty-diversified solutions by varying penalty intensities and (ii) variation-diversified solutions with distinct structural characteristics provides valuable insights, enabling practitioners to post-select the most suitable solution for their specific needs. However, efficiently discovering these diverse solutions is more challenging than finding a single optimal one. This study introduces Continual Parallel Relaxation Annealing (CPRA), a computationally efficient framework for unsupervised-learning (UL)-based CO solvers that generates diverse solutions within a single training run. CPRA leverages representation learning and parallelization to automatically discover shared representations, substantially accelerating the search for these diverse solutions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that CPRA outperforms existing UL-based solvers in generating these diverse solutions while significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a hypothesis space for deep learning based on deep neural networks (DNNs). By treating a DNN as a function of two variables - the input variable and the parameter variable - we consider the set of DNNs where the parameter variable belongs to a space of weight matrices and biases determined by a prescribed depth and layer widths. To construct a Banach space of functions of the input variable, we take the weak* closure of the linear span of this DNN set. We prove that the resulting Banach space is a reproducing kernel Banach space (RKBS) and explicitly construct its reproducing kernel. Furthermore, we investigate two learning models - regularized learning and the minimum norm interpolation (MNI) problem - within the RKBS framework by establishing representer theorems. These theorems reveal that the solutions to these learning problems can be expressed as a finite sum of kernel expansions based on training data.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable performance in many continuous control tasks. However, a significant obstacle to the real-world application of DRL is the lack of safety guarantees. Although DRL agents can satisfy system safety in expectation through reward shaping, designing agents to consistently meet hard constraints (e.g., safety specifications) at every time step remains a formidable challenge. In contrast, existing work in the field of safe control provides guarantees on persistent satisfaction of hard safety constraints. However, these methods require explicit analytical system dynamics models to synthesize safe control, which are typically inaccessible in DRL settings. In this paper, we present a model-free safe control algorithm, the implicit safe set algorithm, for synthesizing safeguards for DRL agents that ensure provable safety throughout training. The proposed algorithm synthesizes a safety index (barrier certificate) and a subsequent safe control law solely by querying a black-box dynamic function (e.g., a digital twin simulator). Moreover, we theoretically prove that the implicit safe set algorithm guarantees finite time convergence to the safe set and forward invariance for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. We validate the proposed algorithm on the state-of-the-art Safety Gym benchmark, where it achieves zero safety violations while gaining $95\% \pm 9\%$ cumulative reward compared to state-of-the-art safe DRL methods. Furthermore, the resulting algorithm scales well to high-dimensional systems with parallel computing.

Abstract: The state-of-the-art methods for estimating high-dimensional covariance matrices all shrink the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix towards a data-insensitive shrinkage target. The underlying shrinkage transformation is either chosen heuristically - without compelling theoretical justification - or optimally in view of restrictive distributional assumptions. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to construct covariance estimators without imposing restrictive assumptions. That is, we study distributionally robust covariance estimation problems that minimize the worst-case Frobenius error with respect to all data distributions close to a nominal distribution, where the proximity of distributions is measured via a divergence on the space of covariance matrices. We identify mild conditions on this divergence under which the resulting minimizers represent shrinkage estimators. We show that the corresponding shrinkage transformations are intimately related to the geometrical properties of the underlying divergence. We also prove that our robust estimators are efficiently computable and asymptotically consistent and that they enjoy finite-sample performance guarantees. We exemplify our general methodology by synthesizing explicit estimators induced by the Kullback-Leibler, Fisher-Rao, and Wasserstein divergences. Numerical experiments based on synthetic and real data show that our robust estimators are competitive with state-of-the-art estimators.

Abstract: We study the role of contextual information in the online learning problem of brokerage between traders. In this sequential problem, at each time step, two traders arrive with secret valuations about an asset they wish to trade. The learner (a broker) suggests a trading (or brokerage) price based on contextual data about the asset and the market conditions. Then, the traders reveal their willingness to buy or sell based on whether their valuations are higher or lower than the brokerage price. A trade occurs if one of the two traders decides to buy and the other to sell, i.e., if the broker's proposed price falls between the smallest and the largest of their two valuations. We design algorithms for this problem and prove optimal theoretical regret guarantees under various standard assumptions.

Abstract: Large-scale streaming data are common in modern machine learning applications and have led to the development of online learning algorithms. Many fields, such as supply chain management, weather and meteorology, energy markets, and finance, have pivoted towards using probabilistic forecasts. This results in the need not only for accurate learning of the expected value but also for learning the conditional heteroskedasticity and conditional moments. Against this backdrop, we present a methodology for online estimation of regularized, linear distributional models. The proposed algorithm is based on a combination of recent developments for the online estimation of LASSO models and the well-known GAMLSS framework. We provide a case study on day-ahead electricity price forecasting, in which we show the competitive performance of the incremental estimation combined with strongly reduced computational effort. Our algorithms are implemented in a computationally efficient Python package ondil.

<title>Sharp Generalization for Nonparametric Regression in Interpolation Space by Over-Parameterized Neural Networks Trained with Preconditioned Gradient Descent and Early-Stopping</title>

arXiv:2407.11353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonparametric regression using an over-parameterized two-layer neural networks trained with algorithmic guarantees in this paper. We consider the setting where the training features are drawn uniformly from the unit sphere in $\RR^d$, and the target function lies in an interpolation space commonly studied in statistical learning theory. We demonstrate that training the neural network with a novel Preconditioned Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, equipped with early stopping, achieves a sharp regression rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})$ when the target function is in the interpolation space $\bth{\cH_K}^{s'}$ with $s' \ge 3$. This rate is even sharper than the currently known nearly-optimal rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})\log^2(1/\delta)$, where $n$ is the size of the training data and $\delta \in (0,1)$ is a small probability. This rate is also sharper than the standard kernel regression rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha}{2\alpha+1}})$ obtained under the regular Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime when training the neural network with the vanilla gradient descent (GD), where $2\alpha = d/(d-1)$. Our analysis is based on two key technical contributions. First, we present a principled decomposition of the network output at each PGD step into a function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of a newly induced integral kernel, and a residual function with small $L^{\infty}$-norm. Second, leveraging this decomposition, we apply local Rademacher complexity theory to tightly control the complexity of the function class comprising all the neural network functions obtained in the PGD iterates. Our results further suggest that PGD enables the neural network to escape the linear NTK regime and achieve improved generalization, as it effectively induces a new kernel termed the integral kernel, compared to the regular NTK arising from the vanilla GD.

Abstract: In this work, we systematically expose and measure the inconsistency and knowledge gaps of Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, we propose an automated testing framework (called KonTest) which leverages a knowledge graph to construct test cases. KonTest probes and measures the inconsistencies in the LLM's knowledge of the world via a combination of semantically-equivalent queries and test oracles (metamorphic or ontological oracle). KonTest further mitigates knowledge gaps via a weighted LLM model ensemble. Using four state-of-the-art LLMs (Falcon, Gemini, GPT3.5, and Llama2), we show that KonTest generates 19.2% error inducing inputs (1917 errors from 9979 test inputs). It also reveals a 16.5% knowledge gap across all tested LLMs. A mitigation method informed by KonTest's test suite reduces LLM knowledge gap by 32.48%. Our ablation study further shows that GPT3.5 is not suitable for knowledge-based consistency testing because it is only 60%-68% effective in knowledge construction.

<title>Collaborative Mean Estimation Among Heterogeneous Strategic Agents: Individual Rationality, Fairness, and Truthful Contribution</title>

Abstract: We study a collaborative learning problem where $m$ agents aim to estimate a vector $\mu =(\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_d)\in \mathbb{R}^d$ by sampling from associated univariate normal distributions $\{\mathcal{N}(\mu_k, \sigma^2)\}_{k\in[d]}$. Agent $i$ incurs a cost $c_{i,k}$ to sample from $\mathcal{N}(\mu_k, \sigma^2)$. Instead of working independently, agents can exchange data, collecting cheaper samples and sharing them in return for costly data, thereby reducing both costs and estimation error. We design a mechanism to facilitate such collaboration, while addressing two key challenges: ensuring individually rational (IR) and fair outcomes so all agents benefit, and preventing strategic behavior (e.g. non-collection, data fabrication) to avoid socially undesirable outcomes. We design a mechanism and an associated Nash equilibrium (NE) which minimizes the social penalty-sum of agents' estimation errors and collection costs-while being IR for all agents. We achieve a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{m})$-approximation to the minimum social penalty in the worst case and an $\mathcal{O}(1)$-approximation under favorable conditions. Additionally, we establish three hardness results: no nontrivial mechanism guarantees (i) a dominant strategy equilibrium where agents report truthfully, (ii) is IR for every strategy profile of other agents, (iii) or avoids a worst-case $\Omega(\sqrt{m})$ price of stability in any NE. Finally, by integrating concepts from axiomatic bargaining, we demonstrate that our mechanism supports fairer outcomes than one which minimizes social penalty.

Abstract: Reliable transcription of child-adult conversations in clinical settings is crucial for diagnosing developmental disorders like Autism. Recent advances in deep learning and availability of large scale transcribed data has led to development of speech foundation models that have shown dramatic improvements in ASR performance. However, their performance on conversational child-adult interactions remains underexplored. In this work, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of ASR performance on a dataset containing child-adult interactions from autism diagnostic sessions, using Whisper, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM. We find that speech foundation models show a noticeable performance drop (15-20% absolute WER) for child speech compared to adult speech in the conversational setting. Then, we fine-tune the best-performing zero-shot model (Whisper-large) using LoRA in a low-resource setting, yielding 8% and 13% absolute WER improvements for child and adult speech, respectively.

Abstract: The Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer (L2D) framework has been extensively studied for classification and, more recently, regression tasks. However, many real-world applications require solving both tasks jointly in a multi-task setting. We introduce a novel Two-Stage L2D framework for multi-task learning that integrates classification and regression through a unified deferral mechanism. Our method leverages a two-stage surrogate loss family, which we prove to be both Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{R})$-consistent, ensuring convergence to the Bayes-optimal rejector. We derive explicit consistency bounds tied to the cross-entropy surrogate and the $L_1$-norm of agent-specific costs, and extend minimizability gap analysis to the multi-expert two-stage regime. We also make explicit how shared representation learning -- commonly used in multi-task models -- affects these consistency guarantees. Experiments on object detection and electronic health record analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the limitations of existing L2D methods in multi-task scenarios.

Abstract: Category-agnostic pose estimation (CAPE) has traditionally relied on support images with annotated keypoints, a process that is often cumbersome and may fail to fully capture the necessary correspondences across diverse object categories. Recent efforts have explored the use of text queries, leveraging their enhanced stability and generalization capabilities. However, existing approaches often remain constrained by their reliance on support queries, their failure to fully utilize the rich priors embedded in pre-trained large language models, and the limitations imposed by their parametric distribution assumptions. To address these challenges, we introduce CapeLLM, the first multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed for CAPE. Our method only employs query image and detailed text descriptions as an input to estimate category-agnostic keypoints. Our method encompasses effective training strategies and carefully designed instructions for applying the MLLM to CAPE. Moreover, we propose an inference mechanism that further enhances the reasoning process for unseen keypoints. while flexibly modeling their underlying spatial distribution and uncertainty, allowing for adaptive refinement based on contextual cues. We conducted extensive experiments to apply the MLLM to CAPE effectively, focusing not only on the model architecture and prompt design but also on ensuring robustness across input variations. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the MP-100 benchmark in the 1-shot and even 5-shot setting, marking a significant advancement in the field of category-agnostic pose estimation. Code is available at https://github.com/Junhojuno/CapeLLM.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) defenses protect against various risks to security, privacy, and fairness. Real-life models need simultaneous protection against multiple different risks which necessitates combining multiple defenses. But combining defenses with conflicting interactions in an ML model can be ineffective, incurring a significant drop in the effectiveness of one or more defenses being combined. Practitioners need a way to determine if a given combination can be effective. Experimentally identifying effective combinations can be time-consuming and expensive, particularly when multiple defenses need to be combined. We need an inexpensive, easy-to-use combination technique to identify effective combinations. Ideally, a combination technique should be (a) accurate (correctly identifies whether a combination is effective or not), (b) scalable (allows combining multiple defenses), (c) non-invasive (requires no change to the defenses being combined), and (d) general (is applicable to different types of defenses). Prior works have identified several ad-hoc techniques but none satisfy all the requirements above. We propose a principled combination technique, Def\Con, to identify effective defense combinations. Def\Con meets all requirements, achieving 90% accuracy on eight combinations explored in prior work and 81% in 30 previously unexplored combinations that we empirically evaluate in this paper.

Abstract: Music style transfer enables personalized music creation by combining the structure of one piece with the stylistic characteristics of another. While recent approaches have explored text-conditioned generation and diffusion-based synthesis, most require extensive training, paired datasets, or detailed textual annotations. In this work, we introduce Stylus, a novel training-free framework for music style transfer that directly manipulates the self-attention layers of a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Operating in the mel-spectrogram domain, Stylus transfers musical style by replacing key and value representations from the content audio with those of the style reference, without any fine-tuning. To enhance stylization quality and controllability, we further incorporate query preservation, CFG-inspired guidance scaling, multi-style interpolation, and phase-preserving reconstruction. Our method significantly improves perceptual quality and structural preservation compared to prior work, while remaining lightweight and easy to deploy. This work highlights the potential of diffusion-based attention manipulation for efficient, high-fidelity, and interpretable music generation-without training. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms underlying deep neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning and computer vision. One promising, yet only preliminarily explored approach, is feature inversion, which attempts to reconstruct images from intermediate representations using trained inverse neural networks. In this study, we revisit feature inversion, introducing a novel, modular variation that enables significantly more efficient application of the technique. We demonstrate how our method can be systematically applied to the large-scale transformer-based vision models, Detection Transformer and Vision Transformer, and how reconstructed images can be qualitatively interpreted in a meaningful way. We further quantitatively evaluate our method, thereby uncovering underlying mechanisms of representing image features that emerge in the two transformer architectures. Our analysis reveals key insights into how these models encode contextual shape and image details, how their layers correlate, and their robustness against color perturbations. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of transformer-based vision models and their internal representations. The code for reproducing our experiments is available at github.com/wiskott-lab/inverse-tvm.

Abstract: In fishery science, harvest management of size-structured stochastic populations is a long-standing and difficult problem. Rectilinear precautionary policies based on biomass and harvesting reference points have now become a standard approach to this problem. While these standard feedback policies are adapted from analytical or dynamic programming solutions assuming relatively simple ecological dynamics, they are often applied to more complicated ecological settings in the real world. In this paper we explore the problem of designing harvest control rules for partially observed, age-structured, spasmodic fish populations using tools from reinforcement learning (RL) and Bayesian optimization. Our focus is on the case of Walleye fisheries in Alberta, Canada, whose highly variable recruitment dynamics have perplexed managers and ecologists. We optimized and evaluated policies using several complementary performance metrics. The main questions we addressed were: 1. How do standard policies based on reference points perform relative to numerically optimized policies? 2. Can an observation of mean fish weight, in addition to stock biomass, aid policy decisions?

Abstract: To deal with high-dimensional unlabeled datasets in many areas, principal component analysis (PCA) has become a rising technique for unsupervised feature selection (UFS). However, most existing PCA-based methods only consider the structure of datasets by embedding a single sparse regularization or constraint on the transformation matrix. In this paper, we introduce a novel bi-sparse method called BSUFS to improve the performance of UFS. The core idea of BSUFS is to incorporate $\ell_{2,p}$-norm and $\ell_q$-norm into the classical PCA, which enables our method to select relevant features and filter out irrelevant noises, thereby obtaining discriminative features. Here, the parameters $p$ and $q$ are within the range of $[0, 1)$. Therefore, BSUFS not only constructs a unified framework for bi-sparse optimization, but also includes some existing works as special cases. To solve the resulting non-convex model, we propose an efficient proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm using Stiefel manifold optimization and sparse optimization techniques. In addition, the computational complexity analysis is presented. Extensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed BSUFS. The results reveal the advantages of bi-sparse optimization in feature selection and show its potential for other fields in image processing. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/BSUFS.

Abstract: Traditional biometric systems have encountered significant setbacks due to various unavoidable factors, for example, wearing of face masks in face recognition-based biometrics and hygiene concerns in fingerprint-based biometrics. This paper proposes a novel lightweight vision transformer with phase-only cross-attention (POC-ViT) using dual biometric traits of forehead and periocular portions of the face, capable of performing well even with face masks and without any physical touch, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods. The POC-ViT framework is designed to handle two biometric traits and to capture inter-dependencies in terms of relative structural patterns. Each channel consists of a Cross-Attention using phase-only correlation (POC) that captures both their individual and correlated structural patterns. The computation of cross-attention using POC extracts the phase correlation in the spatial features. Therefore, it is robust against variations in resolution and intensity, as well as illumination changes in the input images. The lightweight model is suitable for edge device deployment. The performance of the proposed framework was successfully demonstrated using the Forehead Subcutaneous Vein Pattern and Periocular Biometric Pattern (FSVP-PBP) database, having 350 subjects. The POC-ViT framework outperformed state-of-the-art methods with an outstanding classification accuracy of $98.8\%$ with the dual biometric traits.

Abstract: Two-stage Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables optimal task delegation by assigning each input to either a fixed main model or one of several offline experts, supporting reliable decision-making in complex, multi-agent environments. However, existing L2D frameworks assume clean inputs and are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that can manipulate query allocation--causing costly misrouting or expert overload. We present the first comprehensive study of adversarial robustness in two-stage L2D systems. We introduce two novel attack strategie--untargeted and targeted--which respectively disrupt optimal allocations or force queries to specific agents. To defend against such threats, we propose SARD, a convex learning algorithm built on a family of surrogate losses that are provably Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$-consistent. These guarantees hold across classification, regression, and multi-task settings. Empirical results demonstrate that SARD significantly improves robustness under adversarial attacks while maintaining strong clean performance, marking a critical step toward secure and trustworthy L2D deployment.

Abstract: Query expansion is widely used in Information Retrieval (IR) to improve search outcomes by supplementing initial queries with richer information. While recent Large Language Model (LLM) based methods generate pseudo-relevant content and expanded terms via multiple prompts, they often yield homogeneous, narrow expansions that lack the diverse context needed to retrieve relevant information. In this paper, we propose AMD: a new Agent-Mediated Dialogic Framework that engages in a dialogic inquiry involving three specialized roles: (1) a Socratic Questioning Agent reformulates the initial query into three sub-questions, with each question inspired by a specific Socratic questioning dimension, including clarification, assumption probing, and implication probing, (2) a Dialogic Answering Agent generates pseudo-answers, enriching the query representation with multiple perspectives aligned to the user's intent, and (3) a Reflective Feedback Agent evaluates and refines these pseudo-answers, ensuring that only the most relevant and informative content is retained. By leveraging a multi-agent process, AMD effectively crafts richer query representations through inquiry and feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including BEIR and TREC demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods, offering a robust solution for retrieval tasks.

<title>TAR: Teacher-Aligned Representations via Contrastive Learning for Quadrupedal Locomotion</title>

Abstract: Quadrupedal locomotion via Reinforcement Learning (RL) is commonly addressed using the teacher-student paradigm, where a privileged teacher guides a proprioceptive student policy. However, key challenges such as representation misalignment between privileged teacher and proprioceptive-only student, covariate shift due to behavioral cloning, and lack of deployable adaptation; lead to poor generalization in real-world scenarios. We propose Teacher-Aligned Representations via Contrastive Learning (TAR), a framework that leverages privileged information with self-supervised contrastive learning to bridge this gap. By aligning representations to a privileged teacher in simulation via contrastive objectives, our student policy learns structured latent spaces and exhibits robust generalization to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios, surpassing the fully privileged "Teacher". Results showed accelerated training by 2x compared to state-of-the-art baselines to achieve peak performance. OOD scenarios showed better generalization by 40% on average compared to existing methods. Moreover, TAR transitions seamlessly into learning during deployment without requiring privileged states, setting a new benchmark in sample-efficient, adaptive locomotion and enabling continual fine-tuning in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce UniOcc, a comprehensive, unified benchmark and toolkit for occupancy forecasting (i.e., predicting future occupancies based on historical information) and occupancy prediction (i.e., predicting current-frame occupancy from camera images. UniOcc unifies the data from multiple real-world datasets (i.e., nuScenes, Waymo) and high-fidelity driving simulators (i.e., CARLA, OpenCOOD), providing 2D/3D occupancy labels and annotating innovative per-voxel flows. Unlike existing studies that rely on suboptimal pseudo labels for evaluation, UniOcc incorporates novel evaluation metrics that do not depend on ground-truth labels, enabling robust assessment on additional aspects of occupancy quality. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate that large-scale, diverse training data and explicit flow information significantly enhance occupancy prediction and forecasting performance. Our data and code are available at https://uniocc.github.io/.

Abstract: Tool learning, which allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage external tools for solving complex user tasks, has emerged as a promising avenue for extending model capabilities. However, existing approaches primarily focus on data synthesis for fine-tuning LLMs to invoke tools effectively, largely ignoring how to fully stimulate the potential of the model. In this paper, we propose ToolACE-R, a novel framework that includes both model-aware iterative training and adaptive refinement for tool learning. ToolACE-R features a model-aware iterative training procedure that progressively adjust training samples based on the model's evolving capabilities to maximize its potential. Additionally, it incorporates self-refinement training corpus which emphasizes LLM's ability to iteratively refine their tool calls, optimizing performance without requiring external feedback. Furthermore, we introduce adaptive self-refinement mechanism for efficient test-time scaling, where the trained model can autonomously determine when to stop the process based on iterative self-refinement. We conduct extensive experiments across several benchmark datasets, showing that ToolACE-R achieves competitive performance compared to advanced API-based models. The performance of tool invocation can be further improved efficiently through adaptive self-refinement. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of ToolACE-R, offering a promising direction for more efficient and scalable tool learning.

<title>Hyperflux: Pruning Reveals the Importance of Weights</title>

Abstract: Network pruning is used to reduce inference latency and power consumption in large neural networks. However, most existing methods use ad-hoc heuristics, lacking much insight and justified mainly by empirical results. We introduce Hyperflux, a conceptually grounded L0 pruning approach that estimates each weight's importance through its flux, the gradient's response to the weight's removal. A global pressure term continuously drives all weights toward pruning, with those critical for accuracy being automatically regrown based on their flux. We postulate several properties that naturally follow from our framework and experimentally validate each of them. One such property is the relationship between final sparsity and pressure, for which we derive a generalized scaling-law equation that is used to design our sparsity-controlling scheduler. Empirically, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results with ResNet-50 and VGG-19 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

Abstract: Leveraging large language models in real-world settings often entails a need to utilize domain-specific data and tools in order to follow the complex regulations that need to be followed for acceptable use. Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.

<title>Neuronal correlations shape the scaling behavior of memory capacity and nonlinear computational capability of reservoir recurrent neural networks</title>

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a powerful framework for real-time information processing, characterized by its high computational ability and quick learning, with applications ranging from machine learning to biological systems. In this paper, we investigate how the computational ability of reservoir recurrent neural networks (RNNs) scales with an increasing number of readout neurons. First, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir RNN scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate this observation, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving memory capacity that incorporates the effect of neuronal correlations, which have been ignored in prior theoretical work for analytical simplicity. Our theory successfully relates the sublinear scaling of memory capacity to the strength of neuronal correlations. Furthermore, we show this principle holds across diverse types of RNNs, even those beyond the direct applicability of our theory. Next, we numerically investigate the scaling behavior of nonlinear computational ability, which, alongside memory capacity, is crucial for overall computational performance. Our numerical simulations reveal that as memory capacity growth becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial orders. Our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and nonlinear processing.

Abstract: Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.

<title>Sequential QCQP for Bilevel Optimization with Line Search</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.14647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization involves a hierarchical structure where one problem is nested within another, leading to complex interdependencies between levels. We propose a single-loop, tuning-free algorithm that guarantees anytime feasibility, i.e., approximate satisfaction of the lower-level optimality condition, while ensuring descent of the upper-level objective. At each iteration, a convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) with a closed-form solution yields the search direction, followed by a backtracking line search inspired by control barrier functions to ensure safe, uniformly positive step sizes. The resulting method is scalable, requires no hyperparameter tuning, and converges under mild local regularity assumptions. We establish an O(1/k) ergodic convergence rate in terms of a first-order stationary metric and demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness on representative bilevel tasks.

<title>Unraveling the iterative CHAD</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatory Homomorphic Automatic Differentiation (CHAD) was originally formulated as a semantics-driven source-to-source transformation for reverse-mode AD of total (terminating) functional programs. In this work, we extend CHAD to encompass programs featuring constructs such as partial (potentially non-terminating) operations, data-dependent conditionals (e.g., real-valued tests), and iteration constructs (i.e. while-loops), while maintaining CHAD's core principle of structure-preserving semantics.
  A central contribution is the introduction of iteration-extensive indexed categories, which provide a principled integration of iteration into dependently typed programming languages. This integration is achieved by requiring that iteration in the base category lifts to parameterized initial algebras in the indexed category, yielding an op-fibred iterative structure that models while-loops and other iteration constructs in the total category, which corresponds to the category of containers of our dependently typed language.
  Through the idea of iteration-extensive indexed categories, we extend the CHAD transformation to looping programs as the unique structure-preserving functor in a suitable sense. Specifically, it is the unique iterative Freyd category morphism from the iterative Freyd category corresponding to the source language to the category of containers obtained from the target language, such that each primitive operation is mapped to its (transposed) derivative. We establish the correctness of this extended transformation via the universal property of the syntactic categorical model of the source language, showing that the differentiated programs compute correct reverse-mode derivatives of their originals.

<title>Curse of High Dimensionality Issue in Transformer for Long-context Modeling</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language processing tasks by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms. However, long-context modeling faces significant computational inefficiencies due to \textit{redundant} attention computations: while attention weights are often \textit{sparse}, all tokens consume \textit{equal} computational resources. In this paper, we reformulate traditional probabilistic sequence modeling as a \textit{supervised learning task}, enabling the separation of relevant and irrelevant tokens and providing a clearer understanding of redundancy. Based on this reformulation, we theoretically analyze attention sparsity, revealing that only a few tokens significantly contribute to predictions. Building on this, we formulate attention optimization as a linear coding problem and propose a \textit{group coding strategy}, theoretically showing its ability to improve robustness against random noise and enhance learning efficiency. Motivated by this, we propose \textit{Dynamic Group Attention} (DGA), which leverages the group coding to explicitly reduce redundancy by aggregating less important tokens during attention computation. Empirical results show that our DGA significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.Code is available at https://github.com/bolixinyu/DynamicGroupAttention.

<title>Prompt Attacks Reveal Superficial Knowledge Removal in Unlearning Methods</title>

arXiv:2506.10236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that certain machine unlearning methods may fail under straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight unlearning techniques across three model families using output-based, logit-based, and probe analysis to assess the extent to which supposedly unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR exhibit robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt attacks (e.g., prepending Hindi filler text to the original prompt recovers 57.3% accuracy). Our logit analysis further indicates that unlearned models are unlikely to hide knowledge through changes in answer formatting, given the strong correlation between output and logit accuracy. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between genuine knowledge removal and superficial output suppression. To facilitate further research, we publicly release our evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve unlearned knowledge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate model behavior across three core dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Political Compass Test (PCT) or similar questionnaires have been used to quantify LLM's political leanings. Building on a recent line of work that examines the validity of PCT tests, we demonstrate that variation in standard generation parameters does not significantly impact the models' PCT scores. However, external factors such as prompt variations and fine-tuning individually and in combination affect the same. Finally, we demonstrate that when models are fine-tuned on text datasets with higher political content than others, the PCT scores are not differentially affected. This calls for a thorough investigation into the validity of PCT and similar tests, as well as the mechanism by which political leanings are encoded in LLMs.

Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks. However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks, demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

arXiv:2507.08280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of missing values often reflects variations in data collection policies, which may shift across time or locations, even when the underlying feature distribution remains stable. Such shifts in the missingness distribution between training and test inputs pose a significant challenge to achieving robust predictive performance. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework designed to address this challenge, particularly in the common yet challenging scenario where the test-time dataset is unseen. We begin by introducing a set of mutual information-based conditions, called MI robustness conditions, which guide the prediction model to extract label-relevant information. This promotes robustness against distributional shifts in missingness at test-time. To enforce these conditions, we design simple yet effective loss terms that collectively define our final objective, called MIRRAMS. Importantly, our method does not rely on any specific missingness assumption such as MCAR, MAR, or MNAR, making it applicable to a broad range of scenarios. Furthermore, it can naturally extend to cases where labels are also missing in training data, by generalizing the framework to a semi-supervised learning setting. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark tabular datasets demonstrate that MIRRAMS consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines and maintains stable performance under diverse missingness conditions. Moreover, it achieves superior performance even in fully observed settings, highlighting MIRRAMS as a powerful, off-the-shelf framework for general-purpose tabular learning.

<title>Oranits: Mission Assignment and Task Offloading in Open RAN-based ITS using Metaheuristic and Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2507.19712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore mission assignment and task offloading in an Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN)-based intelligent transportation system (ITS), where autonomous vehicles leverage mobile edge computing for efficient processing. Existing studies often overlook the intricate interdependencies between missions and the costs associated with offloading tasks to edge servers, leading to suboptimal decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission dependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle cooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach. First, we develop a metaheuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm, namely the Chaotic Gaussian-based Global ARO (CGG-ARO), serving as a baseline for one-slot optimization. Second, we design an enhanced reward-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, referred to as the Multi-agent Double Deep Q-Network (MA-DDQN), that integrates both multi-agent coordination and multi-action selection mechanisms, significantly reducing mission assignment time and improving adaptability over baseline methods. Extensive simulations reveal that CGG-ARO improves the number of completed missions and overall benefit by approximately 7.1% and 7.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, MA-DDQN achieves even greater improvements of 11.0% in terms of mission completions and 12.5% in terms of the overall benefit. These results highlight the effectiveness of Oranits in enabling faster, more adaptive, and more efficient task processing in dynamic ITS environments.

Abstract: Native AI support is a key objective in the evolution of 6G networks, with Federated Learning (FL) emerging as a promising paradigm. FL allows decentralized clients to collaboratively train an AI model without directly sharing their data, preserving privacy. Clients train local models on private data and share model updates, which a central server aggregates to refine the global model and redistribute it for the next iteration. However, client data heterogeneity slows convergence and reduces model accuracy, and frequent client participation imposes communication and computational burdens. To address these challenges, we propose FedABC, an innovative client selection algorithm designed to take a long-term view in managing data heterogeneity and optimizing client participation. Inspired by attention mechanisms, FedABC prioritizes informative clients by evaluating both model similarity and each model's unique contributions to the global model. Moreover, considering the evolving demands of the global model, we formulate an optimization problem to guide FedABC throughout the training process. Following the "later-is-better" principle, FedABC adaptively adjusts the client selection threshold, encouraging greater participation in later training stages. Extensive simulations on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that FedABC significantly outperforms existing approaches in model accuracy and client participation efficiency, achieving comparable performance with 32% fewer clients than the classical FL algorithm FedAvg, and 3.5% higher accuracy with 2% fewer clients than the state-of-the-art. This work marks a step toward deploying FL in heterogeneous, resource-constrained environments, thereby supporting native AI capabilities in 6G networks.

Abstract: Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or large behavior models (LBMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those works advancing towards agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's literature.

Summary: 
This study introduces a feature tokenization-based Transformer model for efficiently predicting aircraft Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) in real-time, crucial for runway sequencing in aviation. The model utilizes raw input data such as aircraft latitude, longitude, and weather context to update ETA predictions every second, handling requests at a high frequency of 1HZ. Experimental evaluation at Singapore Changi Airport shows the proposed method outperforming XGBoost with improved accuracy by 7% and requiring only 39% of its computing time.

Abstract: Estimated time of arrival (ETA) for airborne aircraft in real-time is crucial for arrival management in aviation, particularly for runway sequencing. Given the rapidly changing airspace context, the ETA prediction efficiency is as important as its accuracy in a real-time arrival aircraft management system. In this study, we utilize a feature tokenization-based Transformer model to efficiently predict aircraft ETA. Feature tokenization projects raw inputs to latent spaces, while the multi-head self-attention mechanism in the Transformer captures important aspects of the projections, alleviating the need for complex feature engineering. Moreover, the Transformer's parallel computation capability allows it to handle ETA requests at a high frequency, i.e., 1HZ, which is essential for a real-time arrival management system. The model inputs include raw data, such as aircraft latitude, longitude, ground speed, theta degree for the airport, day and hour from track data, the weather context, and aircraft wake turbulence category. With a data sampling rate of 1HZ, the ETA prediction is updated every second. We apply the proposed aircraft ETA prediction approach to Singapore Changi Airport (ICAO Code: WSSS) using one-month Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data from October 1 to October 31, 2022. In the experimental evaluation, the ETA modeling covers all aircraft within a range of 10NM to 300NM from WSSS. The results show that our proposed method method outperforms the commonly used boosting tree based model, improving accuracy by 7\% compared to XGBoost, while requiring only 39\% of its computing time. Experimental results also indicate that, with 40 aircraft in the airspace at a given timestamp, the ETA inference time is only 51.7 microseconds, making it promising for real-time arrival management systems.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis, MoLAN framework, noise suppression, modality-aware blocking, MoLAN+

Summary: 
The paper introduces the MoLAN framework for multimodal sentiment analysis, which addresses the challenge of irrelevant or misleading visual and auditory information commonly faced by existing approaches. MoLAN performs modality-aware blocking by dividing features into multiple blocks and dynamically assigning denoising strengths based on noise level and relevance. This fine-grained noise suppression process preserves essential multimodal information without losing critical data. MoLAN is a flexible and unified framework that can be easily integrated into various multimodal models. The paper also presents MoLAN+, a novel multimodal sentiment analysis approach built upon the MoLAN framework. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of MoLAN across different models and datasets, with MoLAN+ achieving state-of-the-art performance. The code for MoLAN is publicly available on GitHub for further exploration and use. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis aims to integrate information from various modalities, such as audio, visual, and text, to make complementary predictions. However, it often struggles with irrelevant or misleading visual and auditory information. Most existing approaches typically treat the entire modality information (e.g., a whole image, audio segment, or text paragraph) as an independent unit for feature enhancement or denoising. They often suppress the redundant and noise information at the risk of losing critical information. To address this challenge, we propose MoLAN, a unified ModaLity-aware noise dynAmic editiNg framework. Specifically, MoLAN performs modality-aware blocking by dividing the features of each modality into multiple blocks. Each block is then dynamically assigned a distinct denoising strength based on its noise level and semantic relevance, enabling fine-grained noise suppression while preserving essential multimodal information. Notably, MoLAN is a unified and flexible framework that can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of multimodal models. Building upon this framework, we further introduce MoLAN+, a new multimodal sentiment analysis approach. Experiments across five models and four datasets demonstrate the broad effectiveness of the MoLAN framework. Extensive evaluations show that MoLAN+ achieves the state-of-the-art performance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/betterfly123/MoLAN-Framework.

arXiv:2508.09146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The binary exponential backoff scheme is widely used in WiFi 7 and still incurs poor throughput performance under dynamic channel environments. Recent model-based approaches (e.g., non-persistent and $p$-persistent CSMA) simply optimize backoff strategies under a known and fixed node density, still leading to a large throughput loss due to inaccurate node density estimation. This paper is the first to propose LLM transformer-based in-context learning (ICL) theory for optimizing channel access. We design a transformer-based ICL optimizer to pre-collect collision-threshold data examples and a query collision case. They are constructed as a prompt as the input for the transformer to learn the pattern, which then generates a predicted contention window threshold (CWT). To train the transformer for effective ICL, we develop an efficient algorithm and guarantee a near-optimal CWT prediction within limited training steps. As it may be hard to gather perfect data examples for ICL in practice, we further extend to allow erroneous data input in the prompt. We prove that our optimizer maintains minimal prediction and throughput deviations from the optimal values. Experimental results on NS-3 further demonstrate our approach's fast convergence and near-optimal throughput over existing model-based and DRL-based approaches under unknown node densities.

Summary:  
JustDense, an empirical study, questions the necessity of complex sequence mixers in time series analysis (TSA) and proposes replacing them with dense layers. The study systematically replaces sequence mixers in established TSA models with dense layers, showing comparable or superior performance in 29 benchmarks across five TSA tasks. The MatrixMixer framework treats sequence mixers as mixing matrices, enabling a clear theoretical understanding of their role. The results challenge the assumption that deeper and more complex architectures are inherently better in TSA, suggesting that simpler architectures can achieve similar performance. By isolating the mixing operation, JustDense offers insights into architectural and optimization factors influencing TSA model performance. <div>
arXiv:2508.09153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequence and channel mixers, the core mechanism in sequence models, have become the de facto standard in time series analysis (TSA). However, recent studies have questioned the necessity of complex sequence mixers, such as attention mechanisms, demonstrating that simpler architectures can achieve comparable or even superior performance. This suggests that the benefits attributed to complex sequencemixers might instead emerge from other architectural or optimization factors. Based on this observation, we pose a central question: Are common sequence mixers necessary for time-series analysis? Therefore, we propose JustDense, an empirical study that systematically replaces sequence mixers in various well-established TSA models with dense layers. Grounded in the MatrixMixer framework, JustDense treats any sequence mixer as a mixing matrix and replaces it with a dense layer. This substitution isolates the mixing operation, enabling a clear theoretical foundation for understanding its role. Therefore, we conducted extensive experiments on 29 benchmarks covering five representative TSA tasks using seven state-of-the-art TSA models to address our research question. The results show that replacing sequence mixers with dense layers yields comparable or even superior performance. In the cases where dedicated sequence mixers still offer benefits, JustDense challenges the assumption that "deeper and more complex architectures are inherently better" in TSA.

<div> Deep learning, peer effects, social networks, unobserved confounding, feedback loops

Summary:

DIG2RSI is a novel deep learning framework designed to estimate peer causal effects within complex real-world networks, such as social networks. It addresses the challenges of simultaneous feedback between peers and unobserved confounders. By leveraging I-G transformation and 2SRI techniques, DIG2RSI can capture complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional relationships. The framework disentangles mutual peer influences and eliminates bias from feedback loops using the I-G transformation. It also deals with unobserved confounding by constructing valid instrumental variables from network data. Through a two-stage process, DIG2RSI uses neural networks to predict peer exposure and extract residuals as proxies for unobserved confounders. The framework's consistency under standard conditions ensures accurate estimation of peer effects. Empirical results on benchmarks and real-world data demonstrate that DIG2RSI outperforms existing approaches, showcasing its effectiveness in peer effect estimation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating peer causal effects within complex real-world networks such as social networks is challenging, primarily due to simultaneous feedback between peers and unobserved confounders. Existing methods either address unobserved confounders while ignoring the simultaneous feedback, or account for feedback but under restrictive linear assumptions, thus failing to obtain accurate peer effect estimation. In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning framework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an instrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback and unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and high-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to disentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the simultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct valid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on these IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the unobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network augmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as a control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no residual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in capturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances the effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and hidden confounders. We prove consistency of our estimator under standard regularity conditions, ensuring asymptotic recovery of the true peer effect. Empirical results on two semi-synthetic benchmarks and a real-world dataset demonstrate that DIG2RSI outperforms existing approaches.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces AdaPO, an online reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance self-evaluation in Large Multimodal Models during multi-turn conversations. Traditional RL methods suffer from reward hacking when optimizing multiple objectives, leading to model collapse. AdaPO addresses this issue by introducing an Adaptive Reward Model (ARM) and a Reward Aware Dynamic KL Regularization mechanism. ARM evaluates the training state based on model-generated trajectories' performance distribution, while the Dynamic KL Regularization adjusts penalties dynamically based on reward gaps. This adaptive approach allows the model to focus on different sub-tasks' training progress without manual intervention. Experimental results across 8 benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both direct reasoning and self-evaluation abilities. The code will be released to benefit the research community. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Self-evaluation, a model's ability to assess the correctness of its own output, is crucial for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to achieve self-improvement in multi-turn conversations, yet largely absent in foundation models. Recent work has employed reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance self-evaluation; however, its fixed reward mechanism suffers from reward hacking when optimizing multiple training objectives, leading to model collapse. In this paper we propose AdaPO, an online reinforcement learning framework capable of adaptively adjusting training objective in real time according to the current training state for each task. Specifically, to mitigate reward hacking , AdaPO introduces an Adaptive Reward Model (ARM) and a Reward Aware Dynamic KL Regularization mechanism. ARM assesses the task's training state from the distribution of model generated multi-turn trajectories' performance. Reward Aware Dynamic KL replaces a fixed penalty with dynamic coefficients which is modulated by the reward gap between different multi-turn situations. Notably, our method automatically and smoothly adjusts its learning focus based on sub-tasks' training progress without manual intervention. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks and various models show that our method significantly enhances both direct reasoning and self-evaluation capability. We will release our code to contribute to the community.

Summary:
This article introduces a framework for fine-tuning flow-matching generative models to enforce physical constraints and solve inverse problems in scientific systems. The approach involves a post-training procedure that minimizes weak-form residuals of governing PDEs, ensuring physical consistency and adherence to boundary conditions without altering the learned distribution. By incorporating a learnable latent parameter predictor, the model can infer unknown physical inputs such as source terms, material parameters, or boundary data through joint optimization. The model produces physically valid field solutions and accurate estimates of hidden parameters, effectively tackling ill-posed inverse problems while remaining data-driven and physics-aware. Validated on canonical PDE benchmarks, the method showcases improved satisfaction of PDE constraints and precise recovery of latent coefficients. This methodology combines generative modelling and scientific inference, offering opportunities for simulation-driven discovery and efficient modelling of physical systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present a framework for fine-tuning flow-matching generative models to enforce physical constraints and solve inverse problems in scientific systems. Starting from a model trained on low-fidelity or observational data, we apply a differentiable post-training procedure that minimizes weak-form residuals of governing partial differential equations (PDEs), promoting physical consistency and adherence to boundary conditions without distorting the underlying learned distribution. To infer unknown physical inputs, such as source terms, material parameters, or boundary data, we augment the generative process with a learnable latent parameter predictor and propose a joint optimization strategy. The resulting model produces physically valid field solutions alongside plausible estimates of hidden parameters, effectively addressing ill-posed inverse problems in a data-driven yet physicsaware manner. We validate our method on canonical PDE benchmarks, demonstrating improved satisfaction of PDE constraints and accurate recovery of latent coefficients. Our approach bridges generative modelling and scientific inference, opening new avenues for simulation-augmented discovery and data-efficient modelling of physical systems.

<div> Keywords: Autonomous driving, trajectory generation, multi-objective reinforcement learning, adversarial optimization, iterative decision-making

Summary:
EvaDrive introduces a novel approach to autonomous driving by combining trajectory generation and evaluation through multi-objective reinforcement learning. The framework creates a closed-loop co-evolution process where trajectory proposals are continuously refined and evaluated in an adversarial game setting. This allows for diverse driving styles without the need for external preference data and avoids scalarization bias common in traditional reinforcement learning methods. EvaDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark tests, surpassing existing models in terms of Precision-Recall-Dynamic-Move-Scale (PDMS) and Driving Score metrics. By enabling iterative multi-round refinement guided by a Pareto frontier selection mechanism, EvaDrive can escape local optima and maintain trajectory diversity. This innovative framework offers a scalable and effective solution for human-like iterative decision-making in autonomous driving systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving faces significant challenges in achieving human-like iterative decision-making, which continuously generates, evaluates, and refines trajectory proposals. Current generation-evaluation frameworks isolate trajectory generation from quality assessment, preventing iterative refinement essential for planning, while reinforcement learning methods collapse multi-dimensional preferences into scalar rewards, obscuring critical trade-offs and yielding scalarization bias.To overcome these issues, we present EvaDrive, a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that establishes genuine closed-loop co-evolution between trajectory generation and evaluation via adversarial optimization. EvaDrive frames trajectory planning as a multi-round adversarial game. In this game, a hierarchical generator continuously proposes candidate paths by combining autoregressive intent modeling for temporal causality with diffusion-based refinement for spatial flexibility. These proposals are then rigorously assessed by a trainable multi-objective critic that explicitly preserves diverse preference structures without collapsing them into a single scalarization bias.This adversarial interplay, guided by a Pareto frontier selection mechanism, enables iterative multi-round refinement, effectively escaping local optima while preserving trajectory diversity.Extensive experiments on NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving 94.9 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 (surpassing DiffusionDrive by 6.8, DriveSuprim by 5.0, and TrajHF by 0.9) and 64.96 Driving Score on Bench2Drive. EvaDrive generates diverse driving styles via dynamic weighting without external preference data, introducing a closed-loop adversarial framework for human-like iterative decision-making, offering a novel scalarization-free trajectory optimization approach.

Summary:<br />
- Type 1 diabetes leads to insulin deficiency, requiring external insulin injections and increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.
- Data analysis plays a crucial role in improving diabetes care by identifying patterns and trends to predict and prevent adverse events.
- Machine learning models can predict glucose levels and provide early warnings for hypoglycemia.

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder that leads to the destruction of insulin-producing cells, resulting in insulin deficiency, as to why the affected individuals depend on external insulin injections. However, insulin can decrease blood glucose levels and can cause hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a severe event of low blood glucose levels ($\le$70 mg/dL) with dangerous side effects of dizziness, coma, or death. Data analysis can significantly enhance diabetes care by identifying personal patterns and trends leading to adverse events. Especially, machine learning (ML) models can predict glucose levels and provide early alarms. However, diabetes and hypoglycemia research is limited by the unavailability of large datasets. Thus, this work systematically integrates 15 datasets to provide a large database of 2510 subjects with glucose measurements recorded every 5 minutes. In total, 149 million measurements are included, of which 4% represent values in the hypoglycemic range. Moreover, two sub-databases are extracted. Sub-database I includes demographics, and sub-database II includes heart rate data. The integrated dataset provides an equal distribution of sex and different age levels. As a further contribution, data quality is assessed, revealing that data imbalance and missing values present a significant challenge. Moreover, a correlation study on glucose levels and heart rate data is conducted, showing a relation between 15 and 55 minutes before hypoglycemia.

Abstract: Accurate energy consumption forecasting is essential for efficient resource management and sustainability in the building sector. Deep learning models are highly successful but struggle with limited historical data and become unusable when historical data are unavailable, such as in newly constructed buildings. On the other hand, physics-based models, such as EnergyPlus, simulate energy consumption without relying on historical data but require extensive building parameter specifications and considerable time to model a building. This paper introduces a Physics-Guided Memory Network (PgMN), a neural network that integrates predictions from deep learning and physics-based models to address their limitations. PgMN comprises a Parallel Projection Layers to process incomplete inputs, a Memory Unit to account for persistent biases, and a Memory Experience Module to optimally extend forecasts beyond their input range and produce output. Theoretical evaluation shows that components of PgMN are mathematically valid for performing their respective tasks. The PgMN was evaluated on short-term energy forecasting at an hourly resolution, critical for operational decision-making in smart grid and smart building systems. Experimental validation shows accuracy and applicability of PgMN in diverse scenarios such as newly constructed buildings, missing data, sparse historical data, and dynamic infrastructure changes. This paper provides a promising solution for energy consumption forecasting in dynamic building environments, enhancing model applicability in scenarios where historical data are limited or unavailable or when physics-based models are inadequate.

Summary:<br /><br />Next generation nuclear reactors will rely on fully digital instrumentation and control systems, generating multivariate time series data. Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is crucial. Current approaches focus on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection but do not fully characterize the root cause of anomalies. This study proposes an unsupervised explainable AI framework using an autoencoder and customized windowSHAP algorithm to characterize real-time replay attacks in nuclear cyber-physical systems. The framework accurately detects and identifies the source, number, and duration of signals being replayed, achieving 95% accuracy on real-world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor. This approach addresses the need for a more comprehensive understanding of replay attacks and improves the safety and reliability of nuclear reactors. <div>
arXiv:2508.09162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next generation advanced nuclear reactors are expected to be smaller both in size and power output, relying extensively on fully digital instrumentation and control systems. These reactors will generate a large flow of information in the form of multivariate time series data, conveying simultaneously various non linear cyber physical, process, control, sensor, and operational states. Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is becoming increasingly important for networked communication and a requirement for safe and reliable operation. Current efforts to address replay attacks, almost universally focus on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection approaches without further identifying and characterizing the root cause of the anomaly. In addition, these approaches rely mostly on synthetic data with uncorrelated Gaussian process and measurement noise and full state feedback or are limited to univariate signals, signal stationarity, linear quadratic regulators, or other linear-time invariant state-space which may fail to capture any unmodeled system dynamics. In the realm of regulated nuclear cyber-physical systems, additional work is needed on characterization of replay attacks and explainability of predictions using real data. Here, we propose an unsupervised explainable AI framework based on a combination of autoencoder and customized windowSHAP algorithm to fully characterize real-time replay attacks, i.e., detection, source identification, timing and type, of increasing complexity during a dynamic time evolving reactor process. The proposed XAI framework was benchmarked on several real world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor PUR-1 with up to six signals concurrently being replayed. In all cases, the XAI framework was able to detect and identify the source and number of signals being replayed and the duration of the falsification with 95 percent or better accuracy.

Summary: 
Stochastic computing (SC) is proposed as a low-power option for neural networks (NNs) in IoT environments. A new approach, Adjustable Sequence Length (ASL), is introduced to improve layer-wise mixed-precision implementation in SC NNs. ASL leverages operator-norm-based theoretical models to analyze truncation noise propagation through layers and optimize sequence length configurations. A sensitivity analysis validates the effectiveness of ASL in reducing energy and latency overheads by up to 60% with minimal accuracy loss. Two truncation strategies, coarse-grained and fine-grained, are proposed to cater to different application scenarios. Evaluation on a 32nm pipelined SC MLP confirms the benefits of ASL for IoT applications and highlights the advantages of mixed-precision truncation in SC designs. <div>
arXiv:2508.09163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic computing (SC) has emerged as an efficient low-power alternative for deploying neural networks (NNs) in resource-limited scenarios, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). By encoding values as serial bitstreams, SC significantly reduces energy dissipation compared to conventional floating-point (FP) designs; however, further improvement of layer-wise mixed-precision implementation for SC remains unexplored. This article introduces Adjustable Sequence Length (ASL), a novel scheme that applies mixed-precision concepts specifically to SC NNs. By introducing an operator-norm-based theoretical model, this article shows that truncation noise can cumulatively propagate through the layers by the estimated amplification factors. An extended sensitivity analysis is presented, using random forest (RF) regression to evaluate multilayer truncation effects and validate the alignment of theoretical predictions with practical network behaviors. To accommodate different application scenarios, this article proposes two truncation strategies (coarse-grained and fine-grained), which apply diverse sequence length configurations at each layer. Evaluations on a pipelined SC MLP synthesized at 32nm demonstrate that ASL can reduce energy and latency overheads by up to over 60% with negligible accuracy loss. It confirms the feasibility of the ASL scheme for IoT applications and highlights the distinct advantages of mixed-precision truncation in SC designs.

<div> Population synthesis, deep generative models, diffusion model, attribute combinations, feasibility<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Population synthesis is a crucial task in agent-based modeling for intelligent transportation systems. With large numbers of attributes, sparsity in survey data can make accurate population modeling challenging. A novel diffusion model-based approach is proposed to estimate the joint distribution of a population, allowing for the recovery of missing sampling zeros while minimizing generated structural zeros. Compared to existing methods like VAE and GAN, this approach strikes a better balance between feasibility and diversity in the synthesized population. The performance is evaluated using metrics such as marginal distribution similarity, feasibility, and diversity, showing superior results in accurately representing the population. <div>

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical task that involves generating synthetic yet realistic representations of populations. It is a fundamental problem in agent-based modeling (ABM), which has become the standard to analyze intelligent transportation systems. The synthetic population serves as the primary input for ABM transportation simulation, with traveling agents represented by population members. However, when the number of attributes describing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the joint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of dimensionality. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately model and produce the population. Interestingly, deep generative models trained from available sample data can potentially synthesize possible attribute combinations that present in the actual population but do not exist in the sample data(called sampling zeros). Nevertheless, this comes at the cost of falsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that do not exist in the population (called structural zeros). In this study, a novel diffusion model-based population synthesis method is proposed to estimate the underlying joint distribution of a population. This approach enables the recovery of numerous missing sampling zeros while keeping the generated structural zeros minimal. Our method is compared with other recently proposed approaches such as Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) approaches, which have shown success in high dimensional tabular population synthesis. We assess the performance of the synthesized outputs using a range of metrics, including marginal distribution similarity, feasibility, and diversity. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous approaches in achieving a better balance between the feasibility and diversity of the synthesized population.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) as an important tool for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases such as arrhythmia. Due to the differences in ECG layouts used by different hospitals, the digitized signals exhibit asynchronous lead time and partial blackout loss, which poses a serious challenge to existing models. To address this challenge, the study introduced PatchECG, a framework for adaptive variable block count missing representation learning based on a masking training strategy, which automatically focuses on key patches with collaborative dependencies between leads, thereby achieving key recognition of arrhythmia in ECGs with different layouts. Experiments were conducted on the PTB-XL dataset and 21388 asynchronous ECG images generated using ECG image kit tool, using the 23 Subclasses as labels. The proposed method demonstrated strong robustness under different layouts, with average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.835 and remained stable (unchanged with layout changes). In external validation based on 400 real ECG images data from Chaoyang Hospital, the AUROC for atrial fibrillation diagnosis reached 0.778; On 12 x 1 layout ECGs, AUROC reaches 0.893. This result is superior to various classic interpolation and baseline methods, and compared to the current optimal large-scale pre-training model ECGFounder, it has improved by 0.111 and 0.19.

Summary:
The article introduces a lightweight training-free approach, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to address the modality gap in large multimodal models (LMMs). By using a linear mapping technique, RAG efficiently extends across modalities by retrieving closest textual descriptions from the training set to generate new descriptions. An iterative method is introduced to optimize the mapping by generating synthetic descriptions through a language model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show significant improvements in image description generation. The proposed approach mitigates the need for costly fine-tuning by leveraging existing textual data for improved multimodal input processing.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Textual descriptions for multimodal inputs entail recurrent refinement of queries to produce relevant output images. Despite efforts to address challenges such as scaling model size and data volume, the cost associated with pre-training and fine-tuning remains substantial. However, pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs) encounter a modality gap, characterised by a misalignment between textual and visual representations within a common embedding space. Although fine-tuning can potentially mitigate this gap, it is typically expensive and impractical due to the requirement for extensive domain-driven data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight training-free approach utilising Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend across the modality using a linear mapping, which can be computed efficiently. During inference, this mapping is applied to images embedded by an LMM enabling retrieval of closest textual descriptions from the training set. These textual descriptions, in conjunction with an instruction, cater as an input prompt for the language model to generate new textual descriptions. In addition, we introduce an iterative technique for distilling the mapping by generating synthetic descriptions via the language model facilitating optimisation for standard utilised image description measures. Experimental results on two benchmark multimodal datasets demonstrate significant improvements.

arXiv:2508.09174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm in which multiple clients collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their local private data. However, real-world applications of FL frequently encounter challenges arising from the non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) local datasets across participating clients, which is particularly pronounced in the field of medical imaging, where shifts in image feature distributions significantly hinder the global model's convergence and performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedMP, a novel method designed to enhance FL under non-IID scenarios. FedMP employs stochastic feature manifold completion to enrich the training space of individual client classifiers, and leverages class-prototypes to guide the alignment of feature manifolds across clients within semantically consistent subspaces, facilitating the construction of more distinct decision boundaries. We validate the effectiveness of FedMP on multiple medical imaging datasets, including those with real-world multi-center distributions, as well as on a multi-domain natural image dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that FedMP outperforms existing FL algorithms. Additionally, we analyze the impact of manifold dimensionality, communication efficiency, and privacy implications of feature exposure in our method.

<div> Keywords: dynamic quantization, mixed-precision, integer-only hardware, bit-shift operation, ResNet.

Summary: 
Dynamic Quantization Training (DQT) is a novel framework for deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices. It introduces instance-based mixed-precision quantization, adapting to varying input complexity for superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off. DQT utilizes a nested integer representation and custom integer-only arithmetic to enable on-the-fly bit-width switching through a low-cost bit-shift operation, eliminating the need for costly dequantization and requantization cycles. This makes DQT the first framework to support efficient dynamic quantization without breaking the integer-only hardware paradigm. DQT achieves state-of-the-art performance on ResNet18 and ResNet50, with a 4-bit dynamic ResNet50 achieving 77.00% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Importantly, DQT incurs a bit-width transition cost of only 28.3M bit-shift operations, significantly outperforming previous dynamic approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. This breakthrough in adaptive AI represents a new frontier in deep learning model deployment on resource-constrained devices.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices relies on quantization. While static, uniform quantization applies a fixed bit-width to all inputs, it fails to adapt to their varying complexity. Dynamic, instance-based mixed-precision quantization promises a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off by allocating higher precision only when needed. However, a critical bottleneck remains: existing methods require a costly dequantize-to-float and requantize-to-integer cycle to change precision, breaking the integer-only hardware paradigm and compromising performance gains. This paper introduces Dynamic Quantization Training (DQT), a novel framework that removes this bottleneck. At the core of DQT is a nested integer representation where lower-precision values are bit-wise embedded within higher-precision ones. This design, coupled with custom integer-only arithmetic, allows for on-the-fly bit-width switching through a near-zero-cost bit-shift operation. This makes DQT the first quantization framework to enable both dequantization-free static mixed-precision of the backbone network, and truly efficient dynamic, instance-based quantization through a lightweight controller that decides at runtime how to quantize each layer. We demonstrate DQT state-of-the-art performance on ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 and ResNet50 on ImageNet. On ImageNet, our 4-bit dynamic ResNet50 achieves 77.00% top-1 accuracy, an improvement over leading static (LSQ, 76.70%) and dynamic (DQNET, 76.94%) methods at a comparable BitOPs budget. Crucially, DQT achieves this with a bit-width transition cost of only 28.3M simple bit-shift operations, a drastic improvement over the 56.6M costly Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) floating-point operations required by previous dynamic approaches - unlocking a new frontier in efficient, adaptive AI.

<div> Keywords: single-cell RNA sequencing, cell type annotation, clustering, graph neural networks, contrastive learning<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Accurate cell type annotation is crucial in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to understand cellular heterogeneity. Traditional clustering methods struggle with the high dimensionality and zero elements in scRNA-seq data. To address these challenges, scAGC, a novel clustering method, learns adaptive cell graphs with contrastive guidance. It optimizes feature representations and cell graphs simultaneously using a topology-adaptive graph autoencoder and a Gumbel-Softmax sampling strategy to refine graph structures dynamically. The use of a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) loss helps model the distinct nature of scRNA-seq data, and a contrastive learning objective ensures stability and convergence in graph learning. Experimental results on 9 real datasets show that scAGC outperforms existing methods, achieving the best NMI and ARI scores on most datasets. This method provides a robust and effective approach for cell type annotation in scRNA-seq data analysis.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurate cell type annotation is a crucial step in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, which provides valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity. However, due to the high dimensionality and prevalence of zero elements in scRNA-seq data, traditional clustering methods face significant statistical and computational challenges. While some advanced methods use graph neural networks to model cell-cell relationships, they often depend on static graph structures that are sensitive to noise and fail to capture the long-tailed distribution inherent in single-cell populations.To address these limitations, we propose scAGC, a single-cell clustering method that learns adaptive cell graphs with contrastive guidance. Our approach optimizes feature representations and cell graphs simultaneously in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we introduce a topology-adaptive graph autoencoder that leverages a differentiable Gumbel-Softmax sampling strategy to dynamically refine the graph structure during training. This adaptive mechanism mitigates the problem of a long-tailed degree distribution by promoting a more balanced neighborhood structure. To model the discrete, over-dispersed, and zero-inflated nature of scRNA-seq data, we integrate a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) loss for robust feature reconstruction. Furthermore, a contrastive learning objective is incorporated to regularize the graph learning process and prevent abrupt changes in the graph topology, ensuring stability and enhancing convergence. Comprehensive experiments on 9 real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that scAGC consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, yielding the best NMI and ARI scores on 9 and 7 datasets, respectively.Our code is available at Anonymous Github.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a decentralized framework that enables universal model training through collaborative efforts on mobile nodes, such as smart vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Each smart vehicle acts as a mobile client, contributing to the process without uploading local data. This method leverages non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) training data from different vehicles, influenced by various driving patterns and environmental conditions, which can significantly impact model convergence and accuracy. Although client selection can be a feasible solution for non-IID issues, it faces challenges related to selection metrics. Traditional metrics evaluate client data quality independently per round and require client selection after all clients complete local training, leading to resource wastage from unused training results. In the IoV context, where vehicles have limited connectivity and computational resources, information asymmetry in client selection risks clients submitting false information, potentially making the selection ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Long-term Client-Selection Federated Learning based on Truthful Auction (LCSFLA). This scheme maximizes social welfare with consideration of long-term data quality using a new assessment mechanism and energy costs, and the advised auction mechanism with a deposit requirement incentivizes client participation and ensures information truthfulness. We theoretically prove the incentive compatibility and individual rationality of the advised incentive mechanism. Experimental results on various datasets, including those from IoV scenarios, demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating performance degradation caused by non-IID data.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges posed by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in injecting domain-specific knowledge while introducing safety risks. Various defense strategies have been proposed for alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, but they often lack a comprehensive consideration of safety layers and fine-grained neurons. To address this, the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection method is proposed to reduce fine-tuning safety risks. FGSN integrates multi-scale interactions between safety layers and neurons, localizing more precise fine-grained safety neurons while minimizing interference with task neurons. Safety neuron parameters are then projected onto safety directions to enhance model safety and align with human preferences. Experimental results across multiple fine-tuned LLM models show that the method significantly reduces harmfulness scores and attack success rates while preserving model utility. Additionally, a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron cluster optimization mechanism enhances continual defense and generalization capability against unforeseen safety concerns.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Fine-tuning as service injects domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs), while challenging the original alignment mechanisms and introducing safety risks. A series of defense strategies have been proposed for the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.

Summary: 
TokenCast is a framework for time series forecasting that integrates historical numerical sequences with contextual features using language-based symbolic representations. It transforms continuous numerical sequences into temporal tokens and aligns them with contextual tokens through a pre-trained large language model (LLM). This shared representation space is optimized with autoregressive generative objectives to bridge the semantic gap between modalities. The aligned LLM is then fine-tuned in a supervised manner to predict future temporal tokens, which are decoded back into the original numerical space. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the effectiveness and generalizability of TokenCast in improving forecasting accuracy by leveraging contextual information. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in supporting decision-making across a wide range of critical applications, including energy, healthcare, and finance. Despite recent advances, forecasting accuracy remains limited due to the challenge of integrating historical numerical sequences with contextual features, which often comprise unstructured textual data. To address this challenge, we propose TokenCast, an LLM-driven framework that leverages language-based symbolic representations as a unified intermediary for context-aware time series forecasting. Specifically, TokenCast employs a discrete tokenizer to transform continuous numerical sequences into temporal tokens, enabling structural alignment with language-based inputs. To bridge the semantic gap between modalities, both temporal and contextual tokens are embedded into a shared representation space via a pre-trained large language model (LLM), further optimized with autoregressive generative objectives. Building upon this unified semantic space, the aligned LLM is subsequently fine-tuned in a supervised manner to predict future temporal tokens, which are then decoded back into the original numerical space. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets enriched with contextual features demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of TokenCast.

<div> Keywords: dLLMs, diffusion large language models, autoregressive, inference speed, parallel decoding <br />
Summary:<br />
Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) are being explored as a viable option for text generation, offering the potential to decode multiple tokens simultaneously. However, existing dLLMs have not been able to surpass the inference speed of autoregressive (AR) LLMs of similar size. This paper introduces a novel approach called discrete diffusion forcing (D2F) to enhance the efficiency of dLLMs. D2F equips dLLMs with block-wise autoregressive generation and the ability to predict following tokens without completing prior blocks, transforming them into an AR-diffusion hybrid paradigm. Through an asymmetric distillation process and a pipelined parallel decoding algorithm, D2F dLLMs achieve significantly faster inference speeds compared to existing dLLMs like LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5 on GSM8K dataset. The code for D2F is available on GitHub, offering a more than 50x acceleration in inference speed while maintaining comparable output quality. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for text generation, with the potential to decode multiple tokens in a single iteration. However, none of the existing open-source dLLMs have achieved superior inference speed over AR LLMs of similar size. This paper breaks this barrier based on a simple and effective strategy named discrete diffusion forcing (D2F). D2F equips dLLMs with two key capabilities: (1) block-wise autoregressive generation to enable KV cache utilization; (2) prediction of following tokens without requiring completion of prior blocks for inter-block parallel decoding. In this way, the vanilla dLLMs are refurbished into an AR-diffusion hybrid paradigm for efficient inference. D2F can be implemented with an asymmetric distillation process based on pre-trained dLLMs. We further propose a pipelined parallel decoding algorithm, which enables a trade-off between efficiency and efficacy. Empirically, D2F dLLMs achieve more than $\mathbf{2.5\times}$ inference speed than LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5 on GSM8K. Compared to vanilla dLLMs like LLaDA and Dream, the acceleration can be more than $\mathbf{50\times}$ while maintaining comparable output quality.

<div> Keywords: generative modeling, natural language, procedural content generation, multi-objective instructions, controllability

Summary: 
Generative modeling has advanced, highlighting the importance of natural language for controlling content generation efficiently. However, current methods struggle with leveraging textual input, especially with complex instructions, limiting controllability. To address this, the proposed method, MIPCGRL, utilizes multi-objective representation learning, incorporating sentence embeddings as conditions. By incorporating multi-label classification and multi-head regression networks, MIPCGRL effectively trains a multi-objective embedding space, resulting in improved controllability with multi-objective instructions, achieving up to a 13.8% enhancement. This capability to process complex instructions allows for more expressive and flexible content generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative modeling emphasize the importance of natural language as a highly expressive and accessible modality for controlling content generation. However, existing instructed reinforcement learning for procedural content generation (IPCGRL) method often struggle to leverage the expressive richness of textual input, especially under complex, multi-objective instructions, leading to limited controllability. To address this problem, we propose \textit{MIPCGRL}, a multi-objective representation learning method for instructed content generators, which incorporates sentence embeddings as conditions. MIPCGRL effectively trains a multi-objective embedding space by incorporating multi-label classification and multi-head regression networks. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves up to a 13.8\% improvement in controllability with multi-objective instructions. The ability to process complex instructions enables more expressive and flexible content generation.

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale models, such as large language models (LLMs), incurs substantial costs due to their computational demands. To mitigate these costs and address challenges related to scalability and data security, there is a growing shift towards decentralized systems for model deployment, where choosing efficient inference acceleration schemes become crucial to manage computational resources effectively and enhance system responsiveness. In this work, we address the challenge of selecting optimal acceleration methods in decentralized systems by introducing a meta-learning-based framework. This framework automates the selection process by learning from historical performance data of various acceleration techniques across different tasks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on random selection or expert intuition, our approach systematically identifies the best acceleration strategies based on the specific characteristics of each task. We demonstrate that our meta-learning framework not only streamlines the decision-making process but also consistently outperforms conventional methods in terms of efficiency and performance. Our results highlight the potential of inference acceleration in decentralized AI systems, offering a path towards more democratic and economically feasible artificial intelligence solutions.

<div> marketing strategy, coupon distribution, online platforms, revenue boosting, user engagement 

Summary: 
The paper discusses the inefficiencies of current coupon distribution strategies on online platforms and proposes a new framework called Aligned Decision Transformer for Coupons (ADT4Coupons) to improve revenue and user engagement. The framework is designed to optimize online decision-making by considering general scenarios, sequential modeling with comprehensive historical data, and efficient iterative updates. Empirical results on real-world industrial datasets, as well as public and synthetic datasets, showcase the effectiveness of the ADT4Coupons framework in enhancing long-term revenue. <div>

Abstract: Coupon distribution is a critical marketing strategy used by online platforms to boost revenue and enhance user engagement. Regrettably, existing coupon distribution strategies fall far short of effectively leveraging the complex sequential interactions between platforms and users. This critical oversight, despite the abundance of e-commerce log data, has precipitated a performance plateau. In this paper, we focus on the scene that the platforms make sequential coupon distribution decision multiple times for various users, with each user interacting with the platform repeatedly. Based on this marketing scenario, we propose a novel marketing framework, named Aligned Decision Transformer for Coupons (ADT4Coupons), to directly devise coupon distribution policy for long-term revenue boosting. ADT4Coupons enables optimized online decision-making in a variety of real-world marketing scenarios. It achieves this by seamlessly integrating three key characteristics, general scenarios, sequential modeling with more comprehensive historical data, and efficient iterative updates within a unified framework. Furthermore, empirical results on real-world industrial dataset, alongside public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

Abstract: Quantization method plays a crucial role in improving model efficiency and reducing deployment costs, enabling the widespread application of deep learning models on resource-constrained devices. However, the quantization process inevitably introduces accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Mixture of Quantization Experts( abbr. MoQE), a quantization inference framework based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, aiming to jointly improve the performance of quantization models. MoQE combines multiple quantization variants of one full-precision model as specialized "quantization experts" and dynamically routes input data to the most suitable expert based on its characteristics. MoQE alleviates the performance degradation commonly seen in single quantization models through specialization quantization expert models. We design lightweight, structure-aware router models tailored for both CV and NLP tasks. Experimental evaluations on ResNet, LLaMA, and Qwen model families across benchmark datasets including ImageNet, WikiText, C4, and OpenWebText demonstrate that MoQE achieves performance comparable to SOTA quantization model, without incurring significant increases in inference latency.

Abstract: Laser-enabled selective transfer, a key process in high-throughput microLED fabrication, requires computational models that can plan shift sequences to minimize motion of XY stages and adapt to varying optimization objectives across the substrate. We propose the first repair algorithm based on a differentiable transfer module designed to model discrete shifts of transfer platforms, while remaining trainable via gradient-based optimization. Compared to local proximity searching algorithms, our approach achieves superior repair performance and enables more flexible objective designs, such as minimizing the number of steps. Unlike reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches, our method eliminates the need for handcrafted feature extractors and trains significantly faster, allowing scalability to large arrays. Experiments show a 50% reduction in transfer steps and sub-2-minute planning time on 2000x2000 arrays. This method provides a practical and adaptable solution for accelerating microLED repair in AR/VR and next-generation display fabrication.

<div> Keywords: Test-time adaptation, Hierarchical Adaptive Networks, Dynamic layer selection, Linear layer agreement, Robustness.

Summary:
Hi-Vec is a novel approach for test-time adaptation that utilizes hierarchical adaptive networks with task vectors. It decomposes the encoder's representation space into multiple layers to handle diverse and complex shifts in incoming data streams. The method includes dynamic layer selection for optimal adaptation, weight merging to ensure all layers receive target information, and linear layer agreement as a gating function to prevent fine-tuning on noisy batches. In rigorous evaluations, Hi-Vec outperformed existing methods in challenging scenarios and on multiple target datasets, demonstrating improved robustness, uncertainty handling, and efficacy in limited batch sizes and increased outlier rates. Hi-Vec represents a significant advancement in test-time adaptation techniques, offering a versatile and effective solution for addressing distribution shifts between source and target domains.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation allows pretrained models to adjust to incoming data streams, addressing distribution shifts between source and target domains. However, standard methods rely on single-dimensional linear classification layers, which often fail to handle diverse and complex shifts. We propose Hierarchical Adaptive Networks with Task Vectors (Hi-Vec), which leverages multiple layers of increasing size for dynamic test-time adaptation. By decomposing the encoder's representation space into such hierarchically organized layers, Hi-Vec, in a plug-and-play manner, allows existing methods to adapt to shifts of varying complexity. Our contributions are threefold: First, we propose dynamic layer selection for automatic identification of the optimal layer for adaptation to each test batch. Second, we propose a mechanism that merges weights from the dynamic layer to other layers, ensuring all layers receive target information. Third, we propose linear layer agreement that acts as a gating function, preventing erroneous fine-tuning by adaptation on noisy batches. We rigorously evaluate the performance of Hi-Vec in challenging scenarios and on multiple target datasets, proving its strong capability to advance state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that Hi-Vec improves robustness, addresses uncertainty, and handles limited batch sizes and increased outlier rates.

The model includes a task corrector to extract complex behavioral patterns from trajectory data, clustering historical trajectories to identify motion patterns.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction for buses is crucial in intelligent transportation systems, particularly within urban environments. In developing regions where access to multimodal data is limited, relying solely on onboard GPS data remains indispensable despite inherent challenges. To address this problem, we propose GSMT, a hybrid model that integrates a Graph Attention Network (GAT) with a sequence-to-sequence Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and incorporates a task corrector capable of extracting complex behavioral patterns from large-scale trajectory data. The task corrector clusters historical trajectories to identify distinct motion patterns and fine-tunes the predictions generated by the GAT and RNN. Specifically, GSMT fuses dynamic bus information and static station information through embedded hybrid networks to perform trajectory prediction, and applies the task corrector for secondary refinement after the initial predictions are generated. This two-stage approach enables multi-node trajectory prediction among buses operating in dense urban traffic environments under complex conditions. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance in both short-term and long-term trajectory prediction tasks.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel framework for tabular data modeling using large language models (LLMs). The framework allows for effective utilization of LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios by generating feature values based on task and feature descriptions. This approach enables the creation of zero-shot prototypes without the need for training a classifier or finetuning the LLMs. By using an example-free prompt, the framework overcomes constraints associated with example-based prompts, making it scalable and robust. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in zero and few-shot tabular learning.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to in-depth investigation of their potential in tabular data modeling. However, effectively utilizing advanced LLMs in few-shot and even zero-shot scenarios is still challenging. To this end, we propose a novel LLM-based prototype estimation framework for tabular learning. Our key idea is to query the LLM to generate feature values based example-free prompt, which solely relies on task and feature descriptions. With the feature values generated by LLM, we can build a zero-shot prototype in a training-free manner, which can be further enhanced by fusing few-shot samples, avoiding training a classifier or finetuning the LLMs. Thanks to the example-free prompt and prototype estimation, ours bypasses the constraints brought by the example-based prompt, providing a scalable and robust framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ours in zero and few-shot tabular learning.

Summary:
- The study aims to develop a general system for odor detection using local field potentials (LFPs) from the olfactory bulb.
- Two hypotheses were tested: spectral features of LFPs are enough for robust single-trial odor detection, and signals from the olfactory bulb alone are sufficient.
- An ensemble of convolutional networks (ResCNN and AttentionCNN) was used to decode the presence of odor from multichannel olfactory bulb LFPs.
- The model achieved high accuracy (86.6%), F1-score (81.0%), and AUC (0.9247), outperforming previous benchmarks.
- Results demonstrate the feasibility of robust single-trial odor detection from LFPs and the potential of deep learning models in understanding olfactory representations.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Odor detection underpins food safety, environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and many more fields. The current artificial sensors developed for odor detection struggle with complex mixtures while non-invasive recordings lack reliable single-trial fidelity. To develop a general system for odor detection, in this study we present a preliminary work where we aim to test two hypotheses: (i) that spectral features of local field potentials (LFPs) are sufficient for robust single-trial odor detection and (ii) that signals from the olfactory bulb alone are adequate. To test two hypotheses, we propose an ensemble of complementary one-dimensional convolutional networks (ResCNN and AttentionCNN) that decodes the presence of odor from multichannel olfactory bulb LFPs. Tested on 2,349 trials from seven awake mice, our final ensemble model supports both hypotheses, achieving a mean accuracy of 86.6%, an F1-score of 81.0%, and an AUC of 0.9247, substantially outperforming previous benchmarks. In addition, the t-SNE visualization confirms that our framework captures biologically significant signatures. These findings establish the feasibility of robust single-trial detection of the presence of odor from extracellular LFPs, as well as demonstrate the potential of deep learning models to provide a deeper understanding of olfactory representations.

<div> Graph neural networks, GNNs, over-squashing, rewiring techniques, topology, empirical analyses.

Summary:
Over-squashing in message-passing GNNs limits expressivity due to exponential compression of long-range information. A new method assesses over-squashing between node pairs by their mutual sensitivity decay rate. This method is extended to graph-level statistics. Empirical analyses on various benchmarks show most graph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing. Rewiring strategies effectively mitigate over-squashing, with varying degrees of success depending on dataset and method. Node classification datasets show less notable over-squashing, and the effects of rewiring are inconsistent. Rewiring is most beneficial for substantially over-squashed graphs when applied with restraint. Aggressive rewiring or applying it to minimally over-squashed graphs may not improve performance and could even harm it. A diagnostic tool allows practitioners to assess the potential benefits of rewiring before training. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance across wide-range of domains such as recommender systems, material design, and drug repurposing. Yet message-passing GNNs suffer from over-squashing -- exponential compression of long-range information from distant nodes -- which limits expressivity. Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their practical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical over-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for assessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their mutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four graph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity). Coupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how rewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and node-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most graph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various extents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of mitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and method. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node classification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and performance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These findings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both substantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring, or rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and may even harm performance. Our plug-and-play diagnostic tool lets practitioners decide -- before any training -- whether rewiring is likely to pay off.

Summary: 
This paper explores the vulnerabilities of collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL) to adversarial attacks, focusing on realistic conditions where adversaries can only collect and perturb the observations of deployed agents. The study introduces effective algorithms for generating adversarial perturbations that deceive victim agents by misaligning their perception of the environment. The proposed approach is tested on three benchmarks and 22 environments, showcasing its robustness across various algorithms and scenarios. Importantly, the algorithm demonstrates high sample efficiency, requiring only 1,000 samples compared to millions in previous methods.

Abstract: Collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL) has rapidly evolved, offering state-of-the-art algorithms for real-world applications, including sensitive domains. However, a key challenge to its widespread adoption is the lack of a thorough investigation into its vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Existing work predominantly focuses on training-time attacks or unrealistic scenarios, such as access to policy weights or the ability to train surrogate policies. In this paper, we investigate new vulnerabilities under more realistic and constrained conditions, assuming an adversary can only collect and perturb the observations of deployed agents. We also consider scenarios where the adversary has no access at all. We propose simple yet highly effective algorithms for generating adversarial perturbations designed to misalign how victim agents perceive their environment. Our approach is empirically validated on three benchmarks and 22 environments, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse algorithms and environments. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm is sample-efficient, requiring only 1,000 samples compared to the millions needed by previous methods.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel framework for automated Knowledge Component (KC) discovery in computer science education. The framework utilizes pattern-based KCs to capture recurring structural patterns within student code, allowing for more accurate knowledge modeling. By training a Variational Autoencoder guided by an explainable, attention-based code representation model, important patterns are extracted from student code and clustered to form pattern-based KCs. Evaluation methods including learning curve analysis and Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) show significant improvements in predictive performance over traditional methods. This approach enhances knowledge modeling in CS education by providing an automated, scalable, and explainable way to identify key code patterns and algorithmic constructs necessary for student learning. <div>
arXiv:2508.09281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective personalized learning in computer science education depends on accurately modeling what students know and what they need to learn. While Knowledge Components (KCs) provide a foundation for such modeling, automated KC extraction from student code is inherently challenging due to insufficient explainability of discovered KCs and the open-endedness of programming problems with significant structural variability across student solutions and complex interactions among programming concepts. In this work, we propose a novel, explainable framework for automated KC discovery through pattern-based KCs: recurring structural patterns within student code that capture the specific programming patterns and language constructs that students must master. Toward this, we train a Variational Autoencoder to generate important representative patterns from student code guided by an explainable, attention-based code representation model that identifies important correct and incorrect pattern implementations from student code. These patterns are then clustered to form pattern-based KCs. We evaluate our KCs using two well-established methods informed by Cognitive Science: learning curve analysis and Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). Experimental results demonstrate meaningful learning trajectories and significant improvements in DKT predictive performance over traditional KT methods. This work advances knowledge modeling in CS education by providing an automated, scalable, and explainable framework for identifying granular code patterns and algorithmic constructs, essential for student learning.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses a large dataset into a small synthetic dataset such that learning on the synthetic dataset approximates learning on the original. Training on the distilled dataset can be performed in as little as one step of gradient descent. We demonstrate that distillation is generalizable to different tasks by distilling reinforcement learning environments into one-batch supervised learning datasets. This demonstrates not only distillation's ability to compress a reinforcement learning task but also its ability to transform one learning modality (reinforcement learning) into another (supervised learning). We present a novel extension of proximal policy optimization for meta-learning and use it in distillation of a multi-dimensional extension of the classic cart-pole problem, all MuJoCo environments, and several Atari games. We demonstrate distillation's ability to compress complex RL environments into one-step supervised learning, explore RL distillation's generalizability across learner architectures, and demonstrate distilling an environment into the smallest-possible synthetic dataset.

Abstract: Weather forecasting plays a vital role in disaster preparedness, agriculture, and resource management, yet current centralized forecasting systems are increasingly strained by security vulnerabilities, limited scalability, and susceptibility to single points of failure. To address these challenges, we propose a decentralized weather forecasting framework that integrates Federated Learning (FL) with blockchain technology. FL enables collaborative model training without exposing sensitive local data; this approach enhances privacy and reduces data transfer overhead. Meanwhile, the Ethereum blockchain ensures transparent and dependable verification of model updates. To further enhance the system's security, we introduce a reputation-based voting mechanism that assesses the trustworthiness of submitted models while utilizing the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for efficient off-chain storage. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only improves forecasting accuracy but also enhances system resilience and scalability, making it a viable candidate for deployment in real-world, security-critical environments.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes applications, such as fraud detection or healthcare, but are susceptible to adversarial attacks. A number of techniques have been proposed to provide adversarial robustness guarantees, but support for commonly used aggregation functions in message-passing GNNs is still lacking. In this paper, we develop an exact (sound and complete) verification method for GNNs to compute guarantees against attribute and structural perturbations that involve edge addition or deletion, subject to budget constraints. Focusing on node classification tasks, our method employs constraint solving with bound tightening, and iteratively solves a sequence of relaxed constraint satisfaction problems while relying on incremental solving capabilities of solvers to improve efficiency. We implement GNNev, a versatile solver for message-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions, sum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time. Extensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on two standard benchmarks (Cora and CiteSeer) and two real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) demonstrates its usability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance compared to existing {exact verification} tools on sum-aggregated node classification tasks.

<br />
Summary: 
This article introduces a new magnitude-based synaptic pruning method for artificial neural networks that mimics biological synaptic pruning. The method gradually removes low-importance connections during training, improving efficiency. Integrated directly into the training loop, this approach computes weight importance across layers and progressively increases global sparsity using a cubic schedule. By eliminating the need for separate pruning and fine-tuning phases, it simplifies the process. Experimental results on various time series forecasting models demonstrate consistent gains, with the method outperforming traditional dropout techniques significantly. In financial forecasting tasks, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% compared to models without or with standard dropout, and up to 52% in certain transformer models. This dynamic pruning mechanism offers a practical alternative for regularization, showcasing its potential in diverse architectures.

Abstract: Synaptic pruning in biological brains removes weak connections to improve efficiency. In contrast, dropout regularization in artificial neural networks randomly deactivates neurons without considering activity-dependent pruning. We propose a magnitude-based synaptic pruning method that better reflects biology by progressively removing low-importance connections during training. Integrated directly into the training loop as a dropout replacement, our approach computes weight importance from absolute magnitudes across layers and applies a cubic schedule to gradually increase global sparsity. At fixed intervals, pruning masks permanently remove low-importance weights while maintaining gradient flow for active ones, eliminating the need for separate pruning and fine-tuning phases. Experiments on multiple time series forecasting models including RNN, LSTM, and Patch Time Series Transformer across four datasets show consistent gains. Our method ranked best overall, with statistically significant improvements confirmed by Friedman tests (p < 0.01). In financial forecasting, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% over models with no or standard dropout, and up to 52% in select transformer models. This dynamic pruning mechanism advances regularization by coupling weight elimination with progressive sparsification, offering easy integration into diverse architectures. Its strong performance, especially in financial time series forecasting, highlights its potential as a practical alternative to conventional dropout techniques.

<div> Keywords: RicciFlowRec, recommendation framework, Ricci curvature, financial graphs, risk-aware ranking

Summary:
RicciFlowRec is a novel recommendation framework that utilizes Ricci curvature and flow on dynamic financial graphs to attribute root causes in the financial domain. By analyzing interactions between stocks, macroeconomic indicators, and news, the framework quantifies local stress and traces shock propagation through Ricci flow. The use of discrete Ricci curvature helps identify causal substructures, leading to a structural risk-aware ranking function. Initial results on S&amp;P 500 data combined with sentiment analysis from FinBERT show improved robustness and interpretability in the face of synthetic perturbations. This work lays the foundation for curvature-based attribution and risk-aware ranking, with future plans to incorporate portfolio optimization and return forecasting. RicciFlowRec represents a pioneering effort in applying geometric flow-based reasoning to financial decision-making support.

Abstract: We propose RicciFlowRec, a geometric recommendation framework that performs root cause attribution via Ricci curvature and flow on dynamic financial graphs. By modelling evolving interactions among stocks, macroeconomic indicators, and news, we quantify local stress using discrete Ricci curvature and trace shock propagation via Ricci flow. Curvature gradients reveal causal substructures, informing a structural risk-aware ranking function. Preliminary results on S\&amp;P~500 data with FinBERT-based sentiment show improved robustness and interpretability under synthetic perturbations. This ongoing work supports curvature-based attribution and early-stage risk-aware ranking, with plans for portfolio optimization and return forecasting. To our knowledge, RicciFlowRec is the first recommender to apply geometric flow-based reasoning in financial decision support.

<div> Sparse autoencoders, domain-specific features, medical text, interpretability, Gemma-2 models<br />
Summary:<br />
The study focuses on improving the interpretability of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) by training them on domain-specific data, specifically medical text. By confining the training of SAEs to medical text, the researchers found that the models were able to capture more variance, achieve higher loss recovery, and reduce linear residual error compared to SAEs trained on broad data distributions. The domain-specific SAEs were able to provide a more complete and interpretable latent decomposition, aligning with clinically meaningful concepts. The results suggest that domain-confinement can address key limitations of broad-domain SAEs and highlight the importance of considering domain-specific training for enhanced model performance and interpretability. The findings challenge the notion of scaling foundation models for general-purpose SAEs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.09363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose large language model (LLM) activations into latent features that reveal mechanistic structure. Conventional SAEs train on broad data distributions, forcing a fixed latent budget to capture only high-frequency, generic patterns. This often results in significant linear ``dark matter'' in reconstruction error and produces latents that fragment or absorb each other, complicating interpretation. We show that restricting SAE training to a well-defined domain (medical text) reallocates capacity to domain-specific features, improving both reconstruction fidelity and interpretability. Training JumpReLU SAEs on layer-20 activations of Gemma-2 models using 195k clinical QA examples, we find that domain-confined SAEs explain up to 20\% more variance, achieve higher loss recovery, and reduce linear residual error compared to broad-domain SAEs. Automated and human evaluations confirm that learned features align with clinically meaningful concepts (e.g., ``taste sensations'' or ``infectious mononucleosis''), rather than frequent but uninformative tokens. These domain-specific SAEs capture relevant linear structure, leaving a smaller, more purely nonlinear residual. We conclude that domain-confinement mitigates key limitations of broad-domain SAEs, enabling more complete and interpretable latent decompositions, and suggesting the field may need to question ``foundation-model'' scaling for general-purpose SAEs.

Summary: 
In this study, researchers investigated the alignment between pathological speech information related to dementia and generated images using text-to-image models. Surprisingly, they discovered that dementia detection could be achieved solely from the generated images with an impressive 75% accuracy rate on the ADReSS dataset. Additionally, the researchers developed methods to explain the alignment, shedding light on the specific language components that contribute to the detection. This finding demonstrates the potential of utilizing text-to-image models in the context of dementia-related speech analysis and highlights the effectiveness of explainability methods in revealing the underlying mechanisms of alignment between speech information and generated images. <div>
arXiv:2508.09385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image models generate highly realistic images based on natural language descriptions and millions of users use them to create and share images online. While it is expected that such models can align input text and generated image in the same latent space little has been done to understand whether this alignment is possible between pathological speech and generated images. In this work, we examine the ability of such models to align dementia-related speech information with the generated images and develop methods to explain this alignment. Surprisingly, we found that dementia detection is possible from generated images alone achieving 75% accuracy on the ADReSS dataset. We then leverage explainability methods to show which parts of the language contribute to the detection.

Summary:<br />
This paper presents a novel risk assessment framework for collaborative financial risk analysis across multiple institutions. The method utilizes federated learning, allowing institutions to jointly model and identify risks without sharing raw data. Using a feature attention mechanism and temporal modeling structure, the model employs distributed optimization to train local sub-models at each institution. Differential privacy and noise injection protect model parameters before aggregation by a central server to generate a global model for systemic risk identification. Experimental results demonstrate the model's superior performance in communication efficiency, model accuracy, systemic risk detection, and cross-market generalization compared to traditional centralized methods and existing federated learning variants. The proposed method enhances risk identification scope and efficiency while safeguarding data sovereignty, providing a secure and efficient solution for intelligent financial risk analysis.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of data privacy and collaborative modeling in cross-institution financial risk analysis. It proposes a risk assessment framework based on federated learning. Without sharing raw data, the method enables joint modeling and risk identification across multiple institutions. This is achieved by incorporating a feature attention mechanism and temporal modeling structure. Specifically, the model adopts a distributed optimization strategy. Each financial institution trains a local sub-model. The model parameters are protected using differential privacy and noise injection before being uploaded. A central server then aggregates these parameters to generate a global model. This global model is used for systemic risk identification. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, multiple experiments are conducted. These evaluate communication efficiency, model accuracy, systemic risk detection, and cross-market generalization. The results show that the proposed model outperforms both traditional centralized methods and existing federated learning variants across all evaluation metrics. It demonstrates strong modeling capabilities and practical value in sensitive financial environments. The method enhances the scope and efficiency of risk identification while preserving data sovereignty. It offers a secure and efficient solution for intelligent financial risk analysis.

Abstract: This study proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection method for distributed backend service systems, addressing practical challenges such as complex structural dependencies, diverse behavioral evolution, and the absence of labeled data. The method constructs a dynamic graph based on service invocation relationships and applies graph convolution to extract high-order structural representations from multi-hop topologies. A Transformer is used to model the temporal behavior of each node, capturing long-term dependencies and local fluctuations. During the feature fusion stage, a learnable joint embedding mechanism integrates structural and behavioral representations into a unified anomaly vector. A nonlinear mapping is then applied to compute anomaly scores, enabling an end-to-end detection process without supervision. Experiments on real-world cloud monitoring data include sensitivity analyses across different graph depths, sequence lengths, and data perturbations. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing models on several key metrics, demonstrating stronger expressiveness and stability in capturing anomaly propagation paths and modeling dynamic behavior sequences, with high potential for practical deployment.

<br />
Summary: 
Implicit Hypergraph Neural Networks (IHGNN) introduce a novel approach to modeling higher-order relations in group-based interactions. Unlike traditional hypergraph neural networks with fixed message-passing layers, IHGNN computes representations through a nonlinear fixed-point equation, allowing for stable and efficient global propagation across hyperedges without deep architectures. A well-posed training scheme with provable convergence, analysis of oversmoothing conditions and model expressivity, as well as a transductive generalization bound on hypergraphs, are developed. The implicit-gradient training procedure and projection-based stabilization strategy enhance training robustness. Experimental results on citation benchmarks demonstrate that IHGNN outperforms traditional graph/hypergraph neural network baselines in accuracy and robustness, showing resilience to random initialization and hyperparameter variation. This highlights the strong generalization and practical value of IHGNN for higher-order relational learning. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.09427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world interactions are group-based rather than pairwise such as papers with multiple co-authors and users jointly engaging with items. Hypergraph neural networks have shown great promise at modeling higher-order relations, but their reliance on a fixed number of explicit message-passing layers limits long-range dependency capture and can destabilize training as depth grows. In this work, we introduce Implicit Hypergraph Neural Networks (IHGNN), which bring the implicit equilibrium formulation to hypergraphs: instead of stacking layers, IHGNN computes representations as the solution to a nonlinear fixed-point equation, enabling stable and efficient global propagation across hyperedges without deep architectures. We develop a well-posed training scheme with provable convergence, analyze the oversmoothing conditions and expressivity of the model, and derive a transductive generalization bound on hypergraphs. We further present an implicit-gradient training procedure coupled with a projection-based stabilization strategy. Extensive experiments on citation benchmarks show that IHGNN consistently outperforms strong traditional graph/hypergraph neural network baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Empirically, IHGNN is resilient to random initialization and hyperparameter variation, highlighting its strong generalization and practical value for higher-order relational learning.

arXiv:2508.09447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road traffic congestion is a persistent problem. Focusing resources on the causes of congestion is a potentially efficient strategy for reducing slowdowns. We present NEXICA, an algorithm to discover which parts of the highway system tend to cause slowdowns on other parts of the highway. We use time series of road speeds as inputs to our causal discovery algorithm. Finding other algorithms inadequate, we develop a new approach that is novel in three ways. First, it concentrates on just the presence or absence of events in the time series, where an event indicates the temporal beginning of a traffic slowdown. Second, we develop a probabilistic model using maximum likelihood estimation to compute the probabilities of spontaneous and caused slowdowns between two locations on the highway. Third, we train a binary classifier to identify pairs of cause/effect locations trained on pairs of road locations where we are reasonably certain a priori of their causal connections, both positive and negative. We test our approach on six months of road speed data from 195 different highway speed sensors in the Los Angeles area, showing that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and computation speed.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for multivariate time series mainly includes two paradigms: contrastive methods that excel at instance discrimination and generative approaches that model data distributions. While effective individually, their complementary potential remains unexplored. We propose a Contrastive Generative Time series framework (CoGenT), the first framework to unify these paradigms through joint contrastive-generative optimization. CoGenT addresses fundamental limitations of both approaches: it overcomes contrastive learning's sensitivity to high intra-class similarity in temporal data while reducing generative methods' dependence on large datasets. We evaluate CoGenT on six diverse time series datasets. The results show consistent improvements, with up to 59.2% and 14.27% F1 gains over standalone SimCLR and MAE, respectively. Our analysis reveals that the hybrid objective preserves discriminative power while acquiring generative robustness. These findings establish a foundation for hybrid SSL in temporal domains. We will release the code shortly.

Abstract: A reliable fault diagnosis system should not only accurately classify known health states but also effectively identify unknown faults. In multimode processes, samples belonging to the same health state often show multiple cluster distributions, making it difficult to construct compact and accurate decision boundaries for that state. To address this challenge, a novel open-set fault diagnosis model named fine-grained clustering and rejection network (FGCRN) is proposed. It combines multiscale depthwise convolution, bidirectional gated recurrent unit and temporal attention mechanism to capture discriminative features. A distance-based loss function is designed to enhance the intra-class compactness. Fine-grained feature representations are constructed through unsupervised learning to uncover the intrinsic structures of each health state. Extreme value theory is employed to model the distance between sample features and their corresponding fine-grained representations, enabling effective identification of unknown faults. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates the design of high-performing neural networks but typically targets a single predefined task, thereby restricting its real-world applicability. To address this, Meta Neural Architecture Search (Meta-NAS) has emerged as a promising paradigm that leverages prior knowledge across tasks to enable rapid adaptation to new ones. Nevertheless, existing Meta-NAS methods often struggle with poor generalization, limited search spaces, or high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a novel Meta-NAS framework, GraB-NAS. Specifically, GraB-NAS first models neural architectures as graphs, and then a hybrid search strategy is developed to find and generate new graphs that lead to promising neural architectures. The search strategy combines global architecture search via Bayesian Optimization in the search space with local exploration for novel neural networks via gradient ascent in the latent space. Such a hybrid search strategy allows GraB-NAS to discover task-aware architectures with strong performance, even beyond the predefined search space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraB-NAS outperforms state-of-the-art Meta-NAS baselines, achieving better generalization and search effectiveness.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are ubiquitous technologies deployed across smart cities, industrial sites, and healthcare systems. They continuously generate time series data that enable advanced analytics and automation in industries. However, challenges such as the loss or ambiguity of sensor metadata, heterogeneity in data sources, varying sampling frequencies, inconsistent units of measurement, and irregular timestamps make raw IoT time series data difficult to interpret, undermining the effectiveness of smart systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model, DeepFeatIoT, which integrates learned local and global features with non-learned randomized convolutional kernel-based features and features from large language models (LLMs). This straightforward yet unique fusion of diverse learned and non-learned features significantly enhances IoT time series sensor data classification, even in scenarios with limited labeled data. Our model's effectiveness is demonstrated through its consistent and generalized performance across multiple real-world IoT sensor datasets from diverse critical application domains, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark models. These results highlight DeepFeatIoT's potential to drive significant advancements in IoT analytics and support the development of next-generation smart systems.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more widely adopted and scale up in size, the computational and memory challenges involved in deploying these massive foundation models have grown increasingly severe. This underscores the urgent need to develop more efficient model variants. Faced with this challenge, the present work introduces EGGS-PTP: an Expander-Graph Guided Structured Post-training Pruning method. The proposed approach leverages graph theory to guide the design of N:M structured pruning, effectively reducing model size and computational demands. By incorporating concepts from expander graphs, EGGS-PTP ensures information flow within the pruned network, preserving essential model functionality. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that EGGS-PTP not only achieves significant acceleration and memory savings due to structured sparsity but also outperforms existing structured pruning techniques in terms of accuracy across various LLMs.

<title>NeuronTune: Fine-Grained Neuron Modulation for Balanced Safety-Utility Alignment in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Ensuring robust safety alignment while preserving utility is critical for the reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current techniques fundamentally suffer from intertwined deficiencies: insufficient robustness against malicious attacks, frequent refusal of benign queries, degradation in generated text quality and general task performance--the former two reflecting deficits in robust safety and the latter constituting utility impairment. We trace these limitations to the coarse-grained layer-wise interventions in existing methods. To resolve this, we propose NeuronTune, a fine-grained framework that dynamically modulates sparse neurons to achieve simultaneous safety-utility optimization. Our approach first identifies safety-critical and utility-preserving neurons across all layers via attribution, then employs meta-learning to adaptively amplify safety-neuron activations and suppress utility-neuron activations. Crucially, NeuronTune enables tunable adjustment of intervention scope via neuron-count thresholds, supporting flexible adaptation to security-critical or utility-priority scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art technologies, achieving superior model safety while maintaining excellent utility.

<title>Large-Small Model Collaborative Framework for Federated Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for Foundation Models (FMs) is an essential yet underexplored challenge, especially in Federated Continual Learning (FCL), where each client learns from a private, evolving task stream under strict data and communication constraints. Despite their powerful generalization abilities, FMs often exhibit suboptimal performance on local downstream tasks, as they are unable to utilize private local data. Furthermore, enabling FMs to learn new tasks without forgetting prior knowledge is inherently a challenging problem, primarily due to their immense parameter count and high model complexity. In contrast, small models can be trained locally under resource-constrained conditions and benefit from more mature CL techniques. To bridge the gap between small models and FMs, we propose the first collaborative framework in FCL, where lightweight local models act as a dynamic bridge, continually adapting to new tasks while enhancing the utility of the large model. Two novel components are also included: Small Model Continual Fine-tuning is for preventing small models from temporal forgetting; One-by-One Distillation performs personalized fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance, even when clients utilize heterogeneous small models.

Abstract: Quantized Neural Networks (QNN) with extremely low-bitwidth data have proven promising in efficient storage and computation on edge devices. To further reduce the accuracy drop while increasing speedup, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) becomes a popular solution. However, existing algorithms for exploring MPQ schemes are limited in flexibility and efficiency. Comprehending the complex impacts of different MPQ schemes on post-training quantization and quantization-aware training results is a challenge for conventional methods. Furthermore, an end-to-end framework for the optimization and deployment of MPQ models is missing in existing work.
  In this paper, we propose the MiCo framework, a holistic MPQ exploration and deployment framework for edge AI applications. The framework adopts a novel optimization algorithm to search for optimal quantization schemes with the highest accuracies while meeting latency constraints. Hardware-aware latency models are built for different hardware targets to enable fast explorations. After the exploration, the framework enables direct deployment from PyTorch MPQ models to bare-metal C codes, leading to end-to-end speedup with minimal accuracy drops.

<title>Causal Graph Profiling via Structural Divergence for Robust Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09504</link>

Abstract: With the growing complexity of cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructures such as water treatment networks, there is a pressing need for robust anomaly detection strategies that account for both system vulnerabilities and evolving attack patterns. Traditional methods -- statistical, density-based, and graph-based models struggle with distribution shifts and class imbalance in multivariate time series, often leading to high false positive rates. To address these challenges, we propose CGAD, a Causal Graph-based Anomaly Detection framework designed for reliable cyberattack detection in public infrastructure systems. CGAD follows a two-phase supervised framework -- causal profiling and anomaly scoring. First, it learns causal invariant graph structures representing the system's behavior under "Normal" and "Attack" states using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Second, it employs structural divergence to detect anomalies via causal graph comparison by evaluating topological deviations in causal graphs over time. By leveraging causal structures, CGAD achieves superior adaptability and accuracy in non-stationary and imbalanced time series environments compared to conventional machine learning approaches. By uncovering causal structures beneath volatile sensor data, our framework not only detects cyberattacks with markedly higher precision but also redefines robustness in anomaly detection, proving resilience where traditional models falter under imbalance and drift. Our framework achieves substantial gains in F1 and ROC-AUC scores over best-performing baselines across four industrial datasets, demonstrating robust detection of delayed and structurally complex anomalies.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), catastrophic forgetting remains a substantial challenge, where models lose previously acquired knowledge upon learning new information. Continual learning (CL) strategies have emerged as a potential solution to this problem, with replay-based techniques demonstrating superior performance in preserving learned knowledge. In this context, we introduce Gauss-Tin, a novel approach that integrates the replay strategy with a Gaussian mixture model to enhance the quality of sample selection during training, supplemented by instructional guidance to facilitate the generation of past learning. This method aims to improve LLMs' retention capabilities by strategically reinforcing important past learnings while accommodating new information. Our experimental results indicate a promising 6\% improvement in retention metrics over traditional methods, suggesting that Gauss-Tin is an effective strategy for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in LLMs. This study underscores the potential of hybrid models in enhancing the robustness and adaptability of LLMs in dynamic learning environments.

<title>Time-Aware and Transition-Semantic Graph Neural Networks for Interpretable Predictive Business Process Monitoring</title>

Abstract: Predictive Business Process Monitoring (PBPM) aims to forecast future events in ongoing cases based on historical event logs. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are well suited to capture structural dependencies in process data, existing GNN-based PBPM models remain underdeveloped. Most rely either on short prefix subgraphs or global architectures that overlook temporal relevance and transition semantics. We propose a unified, interpretable GNN framework that advances the state of the art along three key axes. First, we compare prefix-based Graph Convolutional Networks(GCNs) and full trace Graph Attention Networks(GATs) to quantify the performance gap between localized and global modeling. Second, we introduce a novel time decay attention mechanism that constructs dynamic, prediction-centered windows, emphasizing temporally relevant history and suppressing noise. Third, we embed transition type semantics into edge features to enable fine grained reasoning over structurally ambiguous traces. Our architecture includes multilevel interpretability modules, offering diverse visualizations of attention behavior. Evaluated on five benchmarks, the proposed models achieve competitive Top-k accuracy and DL scores without per-dataset tuning. By addressing architectural, temporal, and semantic gaps, this work presents a robust, generalizable, and explainable solution for next event prediction in PBPM.

<title>Decentralized Rank Scheduling for Energy-Constrained Multi-Task Federated Fine-Tuning in Edge-Assisted IoV Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated fine-tuning has emerged as a promising approach for adapting foundation models (FMs) to diverse downstream tasks in edge environments. In Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems, enabling efficient and low-latency multi-task adaptation is particularly challenging due to client mobility, heterogeneous resources, and intermittent connectivity. This paper proposes a hierarchical federated fine-tuning framework that coordinates roadside units (RSUs) and vehicles to support resource-aware and mobility-resilient learning across dynamic IoV scenarios. Leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce a decentralized, energy-aware rank adaptation mechanism formulated as a constrained multi-armed bandit problem. A novel UCB-DUAL algorithm is developed to enable adaptive exploration under per-task energy budgets, achieving provable sublinear regret. To evaluate our method, we construct a large-scale IoV simulator based on real-world trajectories, capturing dynamic participation, RSU handoffs, and communication variability. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off among all baselines, reducing latency by over 24\% and improving average accuracy by more than 2.5\%.

Abstract: Scarcity of labeled data, especially for rare events, hinders training effective machine learning models. This paper proposes SYNAPSE-G (Synthetic Augmentation for Positive Sampling via Expansion on Graphs), a novel pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data for rare event classification, addressing the cold-start problem. This synthetic data serve as seeds for semi-supervised label propagation on a similarity graph constructed between the seeds and a large unlabeled dataset. This identifies candidate positive examples, subsequently labeled by an oracle (human or LLM). The expanded dataset then trains/fine-tunes a classifier. We theoretically analyze how the quality (validity and diversity) of the synthetic data impacts the precision and recall of our method. Experiments on the imbalanced SST2 and MHS datasets demonstrate SYNAPSE-G's effectiveness in finding positive labels, outperforming baselines including nearest neighbor search.

Abstract: Edge General Intelligence (EGI) represents a transformative evolution of edge computing, where distributed agents possess the capability to perceive, reason, and act autonomously across diverse, dynamic environments. Central to this vision are world models, which act as proactive internal simulators that not only predict but also actively imagine future trajectories, reason under uncertainty, and plan multi-step actions with foresight. This proactive nature allows agents to anticipate potential outcomes and optimize decisions ahead of real-world interactions. While prior works in robotics and gaming have showcased the potential of world models, their integration into the wireless edge for EGI remains underexplored. This survey bridges this gap by offering a comprehensive analysis of how world models can empower agentic artificial intelligence (AI) systems at the edge. We first examine the architectural foundations of world models, including latent representation learning, dynamics modeling, and imagination-based planning. Building on these core capabilities, we illustrate their proactive applications across EGI scenarios such as vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, and network functions virtualization, thereby highlighting how they can enhance optimization under latency, energy, and privacy constraints. We then explore their synergy with foundation models and digital twins, positioning world models as the cognitive backbone of EGI. Finally, we highlight open challenges, such as safety guarantees, efficient training, and constrained deployment, and outline future research directions. This survey provides both a conceptual foundation and a practical roadmap for realizing the next generation of intelligent, autonomous edge systems.

Abstract: Selective prediction [Dru13, QV19] models the scenario where a forecaster freely decides on the prediction window that their forecast spans. Many data statistics can be predicted to a non-trivial error rate without any distributional assumptions or expert advice, yet these results rely on that the forecaster may predict at any time. We introduce a model of Prediction with Limited Selectivity (PLS) where the forecaster can start the prediction only on a subset of the time horizon. We study the optimal prediction error both on an instance-by-instance basis and via an average-case analysis. We introduce a complexity measure that gives instance-dependent bounds on the optimal error. For a randomly-generated PLS instance, these bounds match with high probability.

Abstract: Causal inference is crucial for humans to explore the world, which can be modeled to enable an agent to efficiently explore the environment in reinforcement learning. Existing research indicates that establishing the causality between action and state transition will enhance an agent to reason how a policy affects its future trajectory, thereby promoting directed exploration. However, it is challenging to measure the causality due to its intractability in the vast state-action space of complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Goal Discovery with Causal Capacity (GDCC) framework for efficient environment exploration. Specifically, we first derive a measurement of causality in state space, \emph{i.e.,} causal capacity, which represents the highest influence of an agent's behavior on future trajectories. After that, we present a Monte Carlo based method to identify critical points in discrete state space and further optimize this method for continuous high-dimensional environments. Those critical points are used to uncover where the agent makes important decisions in the environment, which are then regarded as our subgoals to guide the agent to make exploration more purposefully and efficiently. Empirical results from multi-objective tasks demonstrate that states with high causal capacity align with our expected subgoals, and our GDCC achieves significant success rate improvements compared to baselines.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently and accurately remains a cornerstone challenge in science and engineering, especially for problems involving complex geometries and limited labeled data. We introduce a Physics- and Geometry- Aware Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator ($\pi$G-Sp$^2$GNO) for learning the solution operators of time-independent and time-dependent PDEs. The proposed approach first improves upon the recently developed Sp$^2$GNO by enabling geometry awareness and subsequently exploits the governing physics to learn the underlying solution operator in a simulation-free setup. While the spatio-spectral structure present in the proposed architecture allows multiscale learning, two separate strategies for enabling geometry awareness is introduced in this paper. For time dependent problems, we also introduce a novel hybrid physics informed loss function that combines higher-order time-marching scheme with upscaled theory inspired stochastic projection scheme. This allows accurate integration of the physics-information into the loss function. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated on number of benchmark examples involving regular and complex domains, variation in geometry during inference, and time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results obtained illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art physics-informed neural operator algorithms in the literature.

Abstract: Multivariate time series data typically comprises two distinct modalities: variable semantics and sampled numerical observations. Traditional time series models treat variables as anonymous statistical signals, overlooking the rich semantic information embedded in variable names and data descriptions. However, these textual descriptors often encode critical domain knowledge that is essential for robust and interpretable modeling. Here we present TimeMKG, a multimodal causal reasoning framework that elevates time series modeling from low-level signal processing to knowledge informed inference. TimeMKG employs large language models to interpret variable semantics and constructs structured Multivariate Knowledge Graphs that capture inter-variable relationships. A dual-modality encoder separately models the semantic prompts, generated from knowledge graph triplets, and the statistical patterns from historical time series. Cross-modality attention aligns and fuses these representations at the variable level, injecting causal priors into downstream tasks such as forecasting and classification, providing explicit and interpretable priors to guide model reasoning. The experiment in diverse datasets demonstrates that incorporating variable-level knowledge significantly improves both predictive performance and generalization.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal Tracks is a Python-based statistical framework for analyzing protein thermal stability data that overcomes key limitations of existing thermal proteome profiling (TPP) work-flows. Unlike standard approaches that assume sigmoidal melting curves and are constrained by empirical null distributions (limiting significant hits to approximately 5 % of data), Thermal Tracks uses Gaussian Process (GP) models with squared-exponential kernels to flexibly model any melting curve shape while generating unbiased null distributions through kernel priors. This framework is particularly valuable for analyzing proteome-wide perturbations that significantly alter protein thermal stability, such as pathway inhibitions, genetic modifications, or environmental stresses, where conventional TPP methods may miss biologically relevant changes due to their statistical constraints. Furthermore, Thermal Tracks excels at analyzing proteins with un-conventional melting profiles, including phase-separating proteins and membrane proteins, which often exhibit complex, non-sigmoidal thermal stability behaviors. Thermal Tracks is freely available from GitHub and is implemented in Python, providing an accessible and flexible tool for proteome-wide thermal profiling studies.

arXiv:2508.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymmetric low-rank matrix completion problem, which can be formulated as an unconstrained non-convex optimization problem with a nonlinear least-squares objective function, and is solved via gradient descent methods. Previous gradient descent approaches typically incorporate regularization terms into the objective function to guarantee convergence. However, numerical experiments and theoretical analysis of the gradient flow both demonstrate that the elimination of regularization terms in gradient descent algorithms does not adversely affect convergence performance. By introducing the leave-one-out technique, we inductively prove that the vanilla gradient descent with spectral initialization achieves a linear convergence rate with high probability. Besides, we demonstrate that the balancing regularization term exhibits a small norm during iterations, which reveals the implicit regularization property of gradient descent. Empirical results show that our algorithm has a lower computational cost while maintaining comparable completion performance compared to other gradient descent algorithms.

Abstract: We develop an operator-theoretic framework for temporal anchoring in embedding spaces, modeled as drift maps interleaved with event-indexed blocks culminating in affine projections. We provide complete proofs for a variable-block contraction lemma (products of Lipschitz factors), a drift--projection convergence theorem with explicit uniform-gap envelopes, and ontological convergence under nested affine anchors with a robustness variant. We formalize an internal Manuscript Computer (MC) whose computations are defined purely by these operators and prove a rigorous finite-run equivalence theorem (with perturbation bounds). For attention layers, we give a self-contained proof that softmax is $1/2$-Lipschitz in $\ell_2$ and derive sufficient layer-contraction conditions (orthogonal/non-orthogonal heads). All floats are placed exactly where written; the manuscript uses only in-paper pseudocode and appendix figures.

Abstract: Noisy labels are inevitable in real-world scenarios. Due to the strong capacity of deep neural networks to memorize corrupted labels, these noisy labels can cause significant performance degradation. Existing research on mitigating the negative effects of noisy labels has mainly focused on robust loss functions and sample selection, with comparatively limited exploration of regularization in model architecture. Inspired by the sparsity regularization used in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we propose a Dynamic Connection Masking (DCM) mechanism for both Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks (MLPs) and KANs to enhance the robustness of classifiers against noisy labels. The mechanism can adaptively mask less important edges during training by evaluating their information-carrying capacity. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate its efficiency in reducing gradient error. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into various noise-robust training methods to build more robust deep networks, including robust loss functions, sample selection strategies, and regularization techniques. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we are also the first to investigate KANs as classifiers against noisy labels, revealing their superior noise robustness over MLPs in real-world noisy scenarios. Our code will soon be publicly available.

Abstract: Brain connectomes, representing neural connectivity as graphs, are crucial for understanding brain organization but costly and time-consuming to acquire, motivating generative approaches. Recent advances in graph generative modeling offer a data-driven alternative, enabling synthetic connectome generation and reducing dependence on large neuroimaging datasets. However, current models face key limitations: (i) compressing the whole graph into a single latent code (e.g., VGAEs) blurs fine-grained local motifs; (ii) relying on rich node attributes rarely available in connectomes reduces reconstruction quality; (iii) edge-centric models emphasize topology but overlook accurate edge-weight prediction, harming quantitative fidelity; and (iv) computationally expensive designs (e.g., edge-conditioned convolutions) impose high memory demands, limiting scalability. We propose GraphTreeGen (GTG), a subtree-centric generative framework for efficient, accurate connectome synthesis. GTG decomposes each connectome into entropy-guided k-hop trees capturing informative local structure, encoded by a shared GCN. A bipartite message-passing layer fuses subtree embeddings with global node features, while a dual-branch decoder jointly predicts edge existence and weights to reconstruct the adjacency matrix. GTG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in self-supervised tasks and remains competitive in supervised settings, delivering higher structural fidelity and more precise weights with far less memory. Its modular design enables extensions to connectome super-resolution and cross-modality synthesis. Code: https://github.com/basiralab/GTG/

Abstract: Large, publicly available clinical datasets have emerged as a novel resource for understanding disease heterogeneity and to explore personalization of therapy. These datasets are derived from data not originally collected for research purposes and, as a result, are often incomplete and lack critical labels. Many AI tools have been developed to retrospectively label these datasets, such as by performing disease classification; however, they often suffer from limited interpretability. Previous work has attempted to explain predictions using Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which learn interpretable concepts that map to higher-level clinical ideas, facilitating human evaluation. However, these models often experience performance limitations when the concepts fail to adequately explain or characterize the task. We use the identification of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as a challenging test case to demonstrate the value of incorporating contextual information from clinical notes to improve CBM performance. Our approach leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to process clinical notes and generate additional concepts, resulting in a 10% performance gain over existing methods. Additionally, it facilitates the learning of more comprehensive concepts, thereby reducing the risk of information leakage and reliance on spurious shortcuts, thus improving the characterization of ARDS.

Abstract: In e-commerce advertising, selecting the most compelling combination of creative elements -- such as titles, images, and highlights -- is critical for capturing user attention and driving conversions. However, existing methods often evaluate creative components individually, failing to navigate the exponentially large search space of possible combinations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named GenCO that integrates generative modeling with multi-instance reward learning. Our unified two-stage architecture first employs a generative model to efficiently produce a diverse set of creative combinations. This generative process is optimized with reinforcement learning, enabling the model to effectively explore and refine its selections. Next, to overcome the challenge of sparse user feedback, a multi-instance learning model attributes combination-level rewards, such as clicks, to the individual creative elements. This allows the reward model to provide a more accurate feedback signal, which in turn guides the generative model toward creating more effective combinations. Deployed on a leading e-commerce platform, our approach has significantly increased advertising revenue, demonstrating its practical value. Additionally, we are releasing a large-scale industrial dataset to facilitate further research in this important domain.

<title>HKT: A Biologically Inspired Framework for Modular Hereditary Knowledge Transfer in Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: A prevailing trend in neural network research suggests that model performance improves with increasing depth and capacity - often at the cost of integrability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a strategy to optimize small, deployable models by enhancing their capabilities through structured knowledge inheritance. We introduce Hereditary Knowledge Transfer (HKT), a biologically inspired framework for modular and selective transfer of task-relevant features from a larger, pretrained parent network to a smaller child model. Unlike standard knowledge distillation, which enforces uniform imitation of teacher outputs, HKT draws inspiration from biological inheritance mechanisms - such as memory RNA transfer in planarians - to guide a multi-stage process of feature transfer. Neural network blocks are treated as functional carriers, and knowledge is transmitted through three biologically motivated components: Extraction, Transfer, and Mixture (ETM). A novel Genetic Attention (GA) mechanism governs the integration of inherited and native representations, ensuring both alignment and selectivity. We evaluate HKT across diverse vision tasks, including optical flow (Sintel, KITTI), image classification (CIFAR-10), and semantic segmentation (LiTS), demonstrating that it significantly improves child model performance while preserving its compactness. The results show that HKT consistently outperforms conventional distillation approaches, offering a general-purpose, interpretable, and scalable solution for deploying high-performance neural networks in resource-constrained environments.

<title>A Machine Learning Approach to Predict Biological Age and its Longitudinal Drivers</title>

Abstract: Predicting an individual's aging trajectory is a central challenge in preventative medicine and bioinformatics. While machine learning models can predict chronological age from biomarkers, they often fail to capture the dynamic, longitudinal nature of the aging process. In this work, we developed and validated a machine learning pipeline to predict age using a longitudinal cohort with data from two distinct time periods (2019-2020 and 2021-2022). We demonstrate that a model using only static, cross-sectional biomarkers has limited predictive power when generalizing to future time points. However, by engineering novel features that explicitly capture the rate of change (slope) of key biomarkers over time, we significantly improved model performance. Our final LightGBM model, trained on the initial wave of data, successfully predicted age in the subsequent wave with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.515$ for males, $R^2 = 0.498$ for females), significantly outperforming both traditional linear models and other tree-based ensembles. SHAP analysis of our successful model revealed that the engineered slope features were among the most important predictors, highlighting that an individual's health trajectory, not just their static health snapshot, is a key determinant of biological age. Our framework paves the way for clinical tools that dynamically track patient health trajectories, enabling early intervention and personalized prevention strategies for age-related diseases.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing interest and adoption of LLMs, with $\mu$Transfer becoming a key technique for tuning hyperparameters in large-scale training. Meanwhile, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a leading architecture in extremely large models. However, the intersection of these two advancements has remained unexplored. In this work, we derive a $\mu$-Parameterization ($\mu$P) for MoE, providing theoretical guarantees for feature learning across model widths in both the router and experts. We empirically validate our parameterization and further investigate how scaling the number of experts and granularity affects the optimal learning rate.

Abstract: Electric load forecasting is pivotal for power system operation, planning and decision-making. The rise of smart grids and meters has provided more detailed and high-quality load data at multiple levels of granularity, from home to bus and cities. Motivated by similar patterns of loads across different cities in a province in eastern China, in this paper we focus on the Multi-Region Electric Load Forecasting (MRELF) problem, targeting accurate short-term load forecasting for multiple sub-regions within a large region. We identify three challenges for MRELF, including regional variation, contextual variation, and temporal variation. To address them, we propose TriForecaster, a new framework leveraging the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach within a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) paradigm to overcome these challenges. TriForecaster features RegionMixer and Context-Time Specializer (CTSpecializer) layers, enabling dynamic cooperation and specialization of expert models across regional, contextual, and temporal dimensions. Based on evaluation on four real-world MRELF datasets with varied granularity, TriForecaster outperforms state-of-the-art models by achieving an average forecast error reduction of 22.4\%, thereby demonstrating its flexibility and broad applicability. In particular, the deployment of TriForecaster on the eForecaster platform in eastern China exemplifies its practical utility, effectively providing city-level, short-term load forecasts for 17 cities, supporting a population exceeding 110 million and daily electricity usage over 100 gigawatt-hours.

Abstract: We present Proto-PINV+H, a fast training paradigm that combines closed-form weight computation with gradient-based optimisation of a small set of synthetic inputs, soft labels, and-crucially-hidden activations. At each iteration we recompute all weight matrices in closed form via two (or more) ridge-regularised pseudo-inverse solves, while updating only the prototypes with Adam. The trainable degrees of freedom are thus shifted from weight space to data/activation space. On MNIST (60k train, 10k test) and Fashion-MNIST (60k train, 10k test), our method reaches 97.8% and 89.3% test accuracy on the official 10k test sets, respectively, in 3.9s--4.5s using approximately 130k trainable parameters and only 250 epochs on an RTX 5060 (16GB). We provide a multi-layer extension (optimised activations at each hidden stage), learnable ridge parameters, optional PCA/PLS projections, and theory linking the condition number of prototype matrices to generalisation. The approach yields favourable accuracy--speed--size trade-offs against ELM, random-feature ridge, and shallow MLPs trained by back-propagation.

Abstract: Gaussian processes are important models in the field of probabilistic numerics. We present a procedure for optimizing Mat\'ern kernel temporal Gaussian processes with respect to the kernel covariance function's hyperparameters. It is based on casting the optimization problem as a recursive Bayesian estimation procedure for the parameters of an autoregressive model. We demonstrate that the proposed procedure outperforms maximizing the marginal likelihood as well as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, both in terms of runtime and ultimate root mean square error in Gaussian process regression.

Abstract: Biomechanical features have become important indicators for evaluating athletes' techniques. Traditionally, experts propose significant features and evaluate them using physics equations. However, the complexity of the human body and its movements makes it challenging to explicitly analyze the relationships between some features and athletes' final performance. With advancements in modern machine learning and statistics, data analytics methods have gained increasing importance in sports analytics. In this study, we leverage machine learning models to analyze expert-proposed biomechanical features from the finals of long jump competitions in the World Championships. The objectives of the analysis include identifying the most important features contributing to top-performing jumps and exploring the combined effects of these key features. Using quantile regression, we model the relationship between the biomechanical feature set and the target variable (effective distance), with a particular focus on elite-level jumps. To interpret the model, we apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) alongside Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots. The findings reveal that, beyond the well-documented velocity-related features, specific technical aspects also play a pivotal role. For male athletes, the angle of the knee of the supporting leg before take-off is identified as a key factor for achieving top 10% performance in our dataset, with angles greater than 169{\deg}contributing significantly to jump performance. In contrast, for female athletes, the landing pose and approach step technique emerge as the most critical features influencing top 10% performances, alongside velocity. This study establishes a framework for analyzing the impact of various features on athletic performance, with a particular emphasis on top-performing events.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has garnered significant attention for its ability to grasp functions/tasks from demonstrations. Recent studies suggest the presence of a latent task/function vector in LLMs during ICL. Merullo et al. (2024) showed that LLMs leverage this vector alongside the residual stream for Word2Vec-like vector arithmetic, solving factual-recall ICL tasks. Additionally, recent work empirically highlighted the key role of Question-Answer data in enhancing factual-recall capabilities. Despite these insights, a theoretical explanation remains elusive. To move one step forward, we propose a theoretical framework building on empirically grounded hierarchical concept modeling. We develop an optimization theory, showing how nonlinear residual transformers trained via gradient descent on cross-entropy loss perform factual-recall ICL tasks via vector arithmetic. We prove 0-1 loss convergence and show the strong generalization, including robustness to concept recombination and distribution shifts. These results elucidate the advantages of transformers over static embedding predecessors. Empirical simulations corroborate our theoretical insights.

Abstract: Preference learning has gained significant attention in tasks involving subjective human judgments, such as \emph{speech emotion recognition} (SER) and image aesthetic assessment. While pairwise frameworks such as RankNet offer robust modeling of relative preferences, they are inherently limited to local comparisons and struggle to capture global ranking consistency. To address these limitations, we propose RankList, a novel listwise preference learning framework that generalizes RankNet to structured list-level supervision. Our formulation explicitly models local and non-local ranking constraints within a probabilistic framework. The paper introduces a log-sum-exp approximation to improve training efficiency. We further extend RankList with skip-wise comparisons, enabling progressive exposure to complex list structures and enhancing global ranking fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across diverse modalities. On benchmark SER datasets (MSP-Podcast, IEMOCAP, BIIC Podcast), RankList achieves consistent improvements in Kendall's Tau and ranking accuracy compared to standard listwise baselines. We also validate our approach on aesthetic image ranking using the Artistic Image Aesthetics dataset, highlighting its broad applicability. Through ablation and cross-domain studies, we show that RankList not only improves in-domain ranking but also generalizes better across datasets. Our framework offers a unified, extensible approach for modeling ordered preferences in subjective learning scenarios.

Abstract: To protect clients' right to be forgotten in federated learning, federated unlearning aims to remove the data contribution of leaving clients from the global learned model. While current studies mainly focused on enhancing unlearning efficiency and effectiveness, the crucial aspects of efficiency fairness and performance fairness among decentralized clients during unlearning have remained largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce FedShard, the first federated unlearning algorithm designed to concurrently guarantee both efficiency fairness and performance fairness. FedShard adaptively addresses the challenges introduced by dilemmas among convergence, unlearning efficiency, and unlearning fairness. Furthermore, we propose two novel metrics to quantitatively assess the fairness of unlearning algorithms, which we prove to satisfy well-known properties in other existing fairness measurements. Our theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation validate FedShard's fairness in terms of both unlearning performance and efficiency. We demonstrate that FedShard mitigates unfairness risks such as cascaded leaving and poisoning attacks and realizes more balanced unlearning costs among clients. Experimental results indicate that FedShard accelerates the data unlearning process 1.3-6.2 times faster than retraining from scratch and 4.9 times faster than the state-of-the-art exact unlearning methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities in tasks such as algorithmic coding and mathematical problem-solving. Recent methods have improved reasoning through expanded corpus and multistage training combining reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. Although some methods suggest that small but targeted dataset can incentivize reasoning via only distillation, a reasoning scaling laws is still taking shape, increasing computational costs. To address this, we propose a data-efficient distillation framework (DED) that optimizes the Pareto frontier of reasoning distillation. Inspired by the on-policy learning and diverse roll-out strategies of reinforcement learning, the key idea of our approach is threefold: (1) We identify that benchmark scores alone do not determine an effective teacher model. Through comprehensive comparisons of leading reasoning LLMs, we develop a method to select an optimal teacher model. (2) While scaling distillation can enhance reasoning, it often degrades out-of-domain performance. A carefully curated, smaller corpus achieves a balanced trade-off between in-domain and out-of-domain capabilities. (3) Diverse reasoning trajectories encourage the student model to develop robust reasoning skills. We validate our method through evaluations on mathematical reasoning (AIME 2024/2025, MATH-500) and code generation (LiveCodeBench), achieving state-of-the-art results with only 0.8k carefully curated examples, bypassing the need for extensive scaling. Our systematic analysis demonstrates that DED outperforms existing methods by considering factors beyond superficial hardness, token length, or teacher model capability. This work offers a practical and efficient pathway to advanced reasoning while preserving general capabilities.

<title>Modern Neural Networks for Small Tabular Datasets: The New Default for Field-Scale Digital Soil Mapping?</title>

Abstract: In the field of pedometrics, tabular machine learning is the predominant method for predicting soil properties from remote and proximal soil sensing data, forming a central component of digital soil mapping. At the field-scale, this predictive soil modeling (PSM) task is typically constrained by small training sample sizes and high feature-to-sample ratios in soil spectroscopy. Traditionally, these conditions have proven challenging for conventional deep learning methods. Classical machine learning algorithms, particularly tree-based models like Random Forest and linear models such as Partial Least Squares Regression, have long been the default choice for field-scale PSM. Recent advances in artificial neural networks (ANN) for tabular data challenge this view, yet their suitability for field-scale PSM has not been proven. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates state-of-the-art ANN architectures, including the latest multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based models (TabM, RealMLP), attention-based transformer variants (FT-Transformer, ExcelFormer, T2G-Former, AMFormer), retrieval-augmented approaches (TabR, ModernNCA), and an in-context learning foundation model (TabPFN). Our evaluation encompasses 31 field- and farm-scale datasets containing 30 to 460 samples and three critical soil properties: soil organic matter or soil organic carbon, pH, and clay content. Our results reveal that modern ANNs consistently outperform classical methods on the majority of tasks, demonstrating that deep learning has matured sufficiently to overcome the long-standing dominance of classical machine learning for PSM. Notably, TabPFN delivers the strongest overall performance, showing robustness across varying conditions. We therefore recommend the adoption of modern ANNs for field-scale PSM and propose TabPFN as the new default choice in the toolkit of every pedometrician.

Abstract: Detecting whether any anomalies exist within a dataset is crucial for effective anomaly detection, yet it remains surprisingly underexplored in anomaly detection literature. This paper presents a comprehensive study that addresses the fundamental question: When can we conclusively determine that anomalies are present? Through extensive experimentation involving over three million statistical tests across various anomaly detection tasks and algorithms, we identify a relationship between the dataset size, contamination rate, and an algorithm-dependent constant $ \alpha_{\text{algo}} $. Our results demonstrate that, for an unlabeled dataset of size $ N $ and contamination rate $ \nu $, the condition $ N \ge \frac{\alpha_{\text{algo}}}{\nu^2} $ represents a lower bound on the number of samples required to confirm anomaly existence. This threshold implies a limit to how rare anomalies can be before proving their existence becomes infeasible.

Abstract: Forecasting in real-world settings requires models to integrate not only historical data but also relevant contextual information, often available in textual form. While recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can be effective context-aided forecasters via na\"ive direct prompting, their full potential remains underexplored. We address this gap with 4 strategies, providing new insights into the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in this setting. ReDP improves interpretability by eliciting explicit reasoning traces, allowing us to assess the model's reasoning over the context independently from its forecast accuracy. CorDP leverages LLMs solely to refine existing forecasts with context, enhancing their applicability in real-world forecasting pipelines. IC-DP proposes embedding historical examples of context-aided forecasting tasks in the prompt, substantially improving accuracy even for the largest models. Finally, RouteDP optimizes resource efficiency by using LLMs to estimate task difficulty, and routing the most challenging tasks to larger models. Evaluated on different kinds of context-aided forecasting tasks from the CiK benchmark, our strategies demonstrate distinct benefits over na\"ive prompting across LLMs of different sizes and families. These results open the door to further simple yet effective improvements in LLM-based context-aided forecasting.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework for high-quality image generation, offering stable training and strong performance across diverse domains. However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly during the iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusion alleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, though at the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such as Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioning denoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. While effective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage and retrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP for similarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the Prototype Diffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directly into the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning - without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDM constructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image features using contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps by aligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns, enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments show that PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational and storage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-based conditioning in diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce a novel class of untrained Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm, called Residual Reservoir Memory Networks (ResRMNs). ResRMN combines a linear memory reservoir with a non-linear reservoir, where the latter is based on residual orthogonal connections along the temporal dimension for enhanced long-term propagation of the input. The resulting reservoir state dynamics are studied through the lens of linear stability analysis, and we investigate diverse configurations for the temporal residual connections. The proposed approach is empirically assessed on time-series and pixel-level 1-D classification tasks. Our experimental results highlight the advantages of the proposed approach over other conventional RC models.

Abstract: The new paradigm of test-time scaling has yielded remarkable breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g. reasoning models) and in generative vision models, allowing models to allocate additional computation during inference to effectively tackle increasingly complex problems. Despite the improvements of this approach, an important limitation emerges: the substantial increase in computation time makes the process slow and impractical for many applications. Given the success of this paradigm and its growing usage, we seek to preserve its benefits while eschewing the inference overhead. In this work we propose one solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge into a model during post-training. Specifically, we replace reward guided test-time noise optimization in diffusion models with a Noise Hypernetwork that modulates initial input noise. We propose a theoretically grounded framework for learning this reward-tilted distribution for distilled generators, through a tractable noise-space objective that maintains fidelity to the base model while optimizing for desired characteristics. We show that our approach recovers a substantial portion of the quality gains from explicit test-time optimization at a fraction of the computational cost.

Abstract: Graph incremental learning is a learning paradigm that aims to adapt trained models to continuously incremented graphs and data over time without the need for retraining on the full dataset. However, regular graph machine learning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when applied to incremental learning settings, where previously learned knowledge is overridden by new knowledge. Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the previously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to maintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however, do not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different timestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks. Some prior patterns can be transferred to help learn new data, while others may deviate from the new data distribution and be detrimental. To address this, we propose a dynamic mixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for incremental learning. Specifically, a DyMoE GNN layer adds new expert networks specialized in modeling the incoming data blocks. We design a customized regularization loss that utilizes data sequence information so existing experts can maintain their ability to solve old tasks while helping the new expert learn the new data effectively. As the number of data blocks grows over time, the computational cost of the full mixture-of-experts (MoE) model increases. To address this, we introduce a sparse MoE approach, where only the top-$k$ most relevant experts make predictions, significantly reducing the computation time. Our model achieved 4.92\% relative accuracy increase compared to the best baselines on class incremental learning, showing the model's exceptional power.

Abstract: Radio map (RM) has recently attracted much attention since it can provide real-time and accurate spatial channel information for 6G services and applications. However, current deep learning-based methods for RM construction exhibit well known accuracy-efficiency trade-off. In this paper, we introduce RadioMamba, a hybrid Mamba-UNet architecture for RM construction to address the trade-off. Generally, accurate RM construction requires modeling long-range spatial dependencies, reflecting the global nature of wave propagation physics. RadioMamba utilizes a Mamba-Convolutional block where the Mamba branch captures these global dependencies with linear complexity, while a parallel convolutional branch extracts local features. This hybrid design generates feature representations that capture both global context and local detail. Experiments show that RadioMamba achieves higher accuracy than existing methods, including diffusion models, while operating nearly 20 times faster and using only 2.9\% of the model parameters. By improving both accuracy and efficiency, RadioMamba presents a viable approach for real-time intelligent optimization in next generation wireless systems.

Abstract: As 6G networks evolve into increasingly AI-driven, user-centric ecosystems, traditional reactive handover mechanisms demonstrate limitations, especially in mobile edge computing and autonomous agent-based service scenarios. This manuscript introduces WAAN, a cross-layer framework that enables intent-aware and proactive handovers by embedding lightweight TinyML agents as autonomous, negotiation-capable entities across heterogeneous edge nodes that contribute to intent propagation and network adaptation. To ensure continuity across mobility-induced disruptions, WAAN incorporates semi-stable rendezvous points that serve as coordination anchors for context transfer and state preservation. The framework's operational capabilities are demonstrated through a multimodal environmental control case study, highlighting its effectiveness in maintaining user experience under mobility. Finally, the article discusses key challenges and future opportunities associated with the deployment and evolution of WAAN.

Abstract: With the advent of 5G networks and technologies, ensuring the integrity and performance of packet core traffic is paramount. During network analysis, test files such as Packet Capture (PCAP) files and log files will contain errors if present in the system that must be resolved for better overall network performance, such as connectivity strength and handover quality. Current methods require numerous person-hours to sort out testing results and find the faults. This paper presents a novel AI/ML-driven Fault Analysis (FA) Engine designed to classify successful and faulty frames in PCAP files, specifically within the 5G packet core. The FA engine analyses network traffic using natural language processing techniques to identify anomalies and inefficiencies, significantly reducing the effort time required and increasing efficiency. The FA Engine also suggests steps to fix the issue using Generative AI via a Large Language Model (LLM) trained on several 5G packet core documents. The engine explains the details of the error from the domain perspective using documents such as the 3GPP standards and user documents regarding the internal conditions of the tests. Test results on the ML models show high classification accuracy on the test dataset when trained with 80-20 splits for the successful and failed PCAP files. Future scopes include extending the AI engine to incorporate 4G network traffic and other forms of network data, such as log text files and multimodal systems.

Abstract: Quantum computation has demonstrated a promising alternative to solving the NP-hard combinatorial problems. Specifically, when it comes to optimization, classical approaches become intractable to account for large-scale solutions. Specifically, we investigate quantum computing to solve the large-scale Capacitated Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (CPDPTW). In this regard, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework augmented with a Parametrized Quantum Circuit (PQC) is designed to minimize the travel time in a realistic last-mile on-demand delivery. A novel problem-specific encoding quantum circuit with an entangling and variational layer is proposed. Moreover, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) are designed for comparison through numerical experiments, highlighting the superiority of the proposed method in terms of the scale of the solution and training complexity while incorporating the real-world constraints.

Abstract: Different CT segmentation datasets are typically obtained from different scanners under different capture settings and often provide segmentation labels for a limited and often disjoint set of organs. Using these heterogeneous data effectively while preserving patient privacy can be challenging. This work presents a novel federated learning approach to achieve universal segmentation across diverse abdominal CT datasets by utilizing model uncertainty for aggregation and predictive uncertainty for inference. Our approach leverages the inherent noise in stochastic mini-batch gradient descent to estimate a distribution over the model weights to provide an on-the-go uncertainty over the model parameters at the client level. The parameters are then aggregated at the server using the additional uncertainty information using a Bayesian-inspired inverse-variance aggregation scheme. Furthermore, the proposed method quantifies prediction uncertainty by propagating the uncertainty from the model weights, providing confidence measures essential for clinical decision-making. In line with recent work shown, predictive uncertainty is utilized in the inference stage to improve predictive performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in improving both the quality of federated aggregation and uncertainty-weighted inference compared to previously established baselines.

Abstract: The process of generating fully colorized drawings from sketches is a large, usually costly bottleneck in the manga and anime industry. In this study, we examine multiple models for image-to-image translation between anime characters and their sketches, including Neural Style Transfer, C-GAN, and CycleGAN. By assessing them qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that C-GAN is the most effective model that is able to produce high-quality and high-resolution images close to those created by humans.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for producing high-fidelity data samples, yet their performance is constrained by the quality of latent representations, typically sampled from classical noise distributions. This study investigates hybrid quantum-classical GANs (HQCGANs) in which a quantum generator, implemented via parameterised quantum circuits, produces latent vectors for a classical discriminator. We evaluate a classical GAN alongside three HQCGAN variants with 3, 5, and 7 qubits, using Qiskit's AerSimulator with realistic noise models to emulate near-term quantum devices. The binary MNIST dataset (digits 0 and 1) is used to align with the low-dimensional latent spaces imposed by current quantum hardware. Models are trained for 150 epochs and assessed with Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID). Results show that while the classical GAN achieved the best scores, the 7-qubit HQCGAN produced competitive performance, narrowing the gap in later epochs, whereas the 3-qubit model exhibited earlier convergence limitations. Efficiency analysis indicates only moderate training time increases despite quantum sampling overhead. These findings validate the feasibility of noisy quantum circuits as latent priors in GAN architectures, highlighting their potential to enhance generative modelling within the constraints of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.

Abstract: Deep generative models open new avenues for simulating realistic genomic data while preserving privacy and addressing data accessibility constraints. While previous studies have primarily focused on generating gene expression or haplotype data, this study explores generating genotype data in both unconditioned and phenotype-conditioned settings, which is inherently more challenging due to the discrete nature of genotype data. In this work, we developed and evaluated commonly used generative models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Diffusion Models, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and proposed adaptation tailored to discrete genotype data. We conducted extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including all chromosomes from cow and multiple chromosomes from human. Model performance was assessed using a well-established set of metrics drawn from both deep learning and quantitative genetics literature. Our results show that these models can effectively capture genetic patterns and preserve genotype-phenotype association. Our findings provide a comprehensive comparison of these models and offer practical guidelines for future research in genotype simulation. We have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/SihanXXX/DiscreteGenoGen.

Abstract: While analysing rare blood cell aggregates remains challenging in automated haematology, they could markedly advance label-free functional diagnostics. Conventional flow cytometers efficiently perform cell counting with leukocyte differentials but fail to identify aggregates with flagged results, requiring manual reviews. Quantitative phase imaging flow cytometry captures detailed aggregate morphologies, but clinical use is hampered by massive data storage and offline processing. Incorporating hidden biomarkers into routine haematology panels would significantly improve diagnostics without flagged results. We present RT-HAD, an end-to-end deep learning-based image and data processing framework for off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM), which combines physics-consistent holographic reconstruction and detection, representing each blood cell in a graph to recognize aggregates. RT-HAD processes >30 GB of image data on-the-fly with turnaround time of <1.5 min and error rate of 8.9% in platelet aggregate detection, which matches acceptable laboratory error rates of haematology biomarkers and solves the big data challenge for point-of-care diagnostics.

arXiv:2508.09217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key challenges to predict odor from molecular structure is unarguably our limited understanding of the odor space and the complexity of the underlying structure-odor relationships. Here, we show that the predictive performance of machine learning models for structure-based odor predictions can be improved using both, an expert and a data-driven odor taxonomy. The expert taxonomy is based on semantic and perceptual similarities, while the data-driven taxonomy is based on clustering co-occurrence patterns of odor descriptors directly from the prepared dataset. Both taxonomies improve the predictions of different machine learning models and outperform random groupings of descriptors that do not reflect existing relations between odor descriptors. We assess the quality of both taxonomies through their predictive performance across different odor classes and perform an in-depth error analysis highlighting the complexity of odor-structure relationships and identifying potential inconsistencies within the taxonomies by showcasing pear odorants used in perfumery. The data-driven taxonomy allows us to critically evaluate our expert taxonomy and better understand the molecular odor space. Both taxonomies as well as a full dataset are made available to the community, providing a stepping stone for a future community-driven exploration of the molecular basis of smell. In addition, we provide a detailed multi-layer expert taxonomy including a total of 777 different descriptors from the Pyrfume repository.

Abstract: Training a single model for multilingual, multi-task speech processing (MSP) is severely hampered by conflicting objectives between tasks like speech recognition and translation. While multi-objective optimization (MOO) aims to align gradient updates, its effectiveness diminishes as the number of tasks grows, making it difficult to find a common descent direction. This raises a fundamental question: should highly conflicting objectives be optimized jointly or separated into a hierarchical structure? To address this question, this paper investigates three multi-objective MSP formulations, which we refer to as \textbf{objective soup recipes}. These formulations apply multi-objective optimization at different optimization levels to mitigate potential conflicts among all objectives. To ensure efficiency, we introduce a lightweight layer-selection mechanism that computes the conflict-avoiding gradient using only the most problematic layers, minimizing computational and memory overhead. Extensive experiments on CoVoST v2, LibriSpeech, and AISHELL-1 reveal that a bi-level recipe separating recognition and translation tasks consistently outperforms standard flat optimization. Our work demonstrates that hierarchical MOO is a more effective and scalable approach for building state-of-the-art MSP models. Our code has been released at https://github.com/afmsaif/Objective_Soups.

Abstract: This paper examines Modern Mercantilism, characterized by rising economic nationalism, strategic technological decoupling, and geopolitical fragmentation, as a disruptive shift from the post-1945 globalization paradigm. It applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to 768-dimensional SBERT-generated semantic embeddings of curated news articles to extract orthogonal latent factors that discriminate binary event outcomes linked to protectionism, technological sovereignty, and bloc realignments. Analysis of principal component loadings identifies key semantic features driving classification performance, enhancing interpretability and predictive accuracy. This methodology provides a scalable, data-driven framework for quantitatively tracking emergent mercantilist dynamics through high-dimensional text analytics

Abstract: An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction, these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/secure-ai-systems-group/adaptive-vision-and-language-navigation.

Abstract: Multimodal data analysis can lead to more accurate diagnoses of brain disorders due to the complementary information that each modality adds. However, a major challenge of using multimodal datasets in the neuroimaging field is incomplete data, where some of the modalities are missing for certain subjects. Hence, effective strategies are needed for completing the data. Traditional methods, such as subsampling or zero-filling, may reduce the accuracy of predictions or introduce unintended biases. In contrast, advanced methods such as generative models have emerged as promising solutions without these limitations. In this study, we proposed a generative adversarial network method designed to reconstruct missing modalities from existing ones while preserving the disease patterns. We used T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging and functional network connectivity as two modalities. Our findings showed a 9% improvement in the classification accuracy for Alzheimer's disease versus cognitive normal groups when using our generative imputation method compared to the traditional approaches.

<title>Value Function Initialization for Knowledge Transfer and Jump-start in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Value function initialization (VFI) is an effective way to achieve a jumpstart in reinforcement learning (RL) by leveraging value estimates from prior tasks. While this approach is well established in tabular settings, extending it to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) poses challenges due to the continuous nature of the state-action space, the noisy approximations of neural networks, and the impracticality of storing all past models for reuse. In this work, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts value function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values extracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base. It employs a knownness-based mechanism to softly integrate these transferred values into underexplored regions and gradually shift toward the agent's learned estimates, avoiding the limitations of fixed time decay. Our approach offers a novel perspective on knowledge transfer in DRL by relying solely on value estimates rather than policies or demonstrations, effectively combining the strengths of jumpstart RL and policy distillation while mitigating their drawbacks. Experiments across multiple continuous control tasks demonstrate that DQInit consistently improves early learning efficiency, stability, and overall performance compared to standard initialization and existing transfer techniques.

Abstract: Advances in speech synthesis intensify security threats, motivating real-time deepfake detection research. We investigate whether bidirectional Mamba can serve as a competitive alternative to Self-Attention in detecting synthetic speech. Our solution, Fake-Mamba, integrates an XLSR front-end with bidirectional Mamba to capture both local and global artifacts. Our core innovation introduces three efficient encoders: TransBiMamba, ConBiMamba, and PN-BiMamba. Leveraging XLSR's rich linguistic representations, PN-BiMamba can effectively capture the subtle cues of synthetic speech. Evaluated on ASVspoof 21 LA, 21 DF, and In-The-Wild benchmarks, Fake-Mamba achieves 0.97%, 1.74%, and 5.85% EER, respectively, representing substantial relative gains over SOTA models XLSR-Conformer and XLSR-Mamba. The framework maintains real-time inference across utterance lengths, demonstrating strong generalization and practical viability. The code is available at https://github.com/xuanxixi/Fake-Mamba.

Abstract: This Innovative Practice full paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance the teaching of code refactoring in software engineering courses through real-time, context-aware feedback. Refactoring improves code quality but is difficult to teach, especially with complex, real-world codebases. Traditional methods like code reviews and static analysis tools offer limited, inconsistent feedback. Our approach integrates LLM-assisted refactoring into a course project using structured prompts to help students identify and address code smells such as long methods and low cohesion. Implemented in Spring 2025 in a long-lived OSS project, the intervention is evaluated through student feedback and planned analysis of code quality improvements. Findings suggest that LLMs can bridge theoretical and practical learning, supporting a deeper understanding of maintainability and refactoring principles.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of sign language in healthcare communication poses a significant challenge, requiring frameworks that can accurately interpret complex multimodal gestures. To deal with this, we propose FusionEnsemble-Net, a novel attention-based ensemble of spatiotemporal networks that dynamically fuses visual and motion data to enhance recognition accuracy. The proposed approach processes RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities synchronously through four different spatiotemporal networks. For each network, features from both modalities are continuously fused using an attention-based fusion module before being fed into an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, the outputs of these four different fused channels are combined in an ensemble classification head, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Experiments demonstrate that FusionEnsemble-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with a test accuracy of 99.44% on the large-scale MultiMeDaLIS dataset for Italian Sign Language. Our findings indicate that an ensemble of diverse spatiotemporal networks, unified by attention-based fusion, yields a robust and accurate framework for complex, multimodal isolated gesture recognition tasks.

Abstract: Low-mass stars and brown dwarfs -- spectral types (SpTs) M0 and later -- play a significant role in studying stellar and substellar processes and demographics, reaching down to planetary-mass objects. Currently, the classification of these sources remains heavily reliant on visual inspection of spectral features, equivalent width measurements, or narrow-/wide-band spectral indices. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) methods offer automated approaches for spectral typing, which are becoming increasingly important as large spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, SDSS, and SPHEREx generate datasets containing millions of spectra. We investigate the application of ML in spectral type classification on low-resolution (R $\sim$ 120) near-infrared spectra of M0--T9 dwarfs obtained with the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We specifically aim to classify the gravity- and metallicity-dependent subclasses for late-type dwarfs. We used binned fluxes as input features and compared the efficacy of spectral type estimators built using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models. We tested the influence of different normalizations and analyzed the relative importance of different spectral regions for surface gravity and metallicity subclass classification. Our best-performing model (using KNN) classifies 95.5 $\pm$ 0.6% of sources to within $\pm$1 SpT, and assigns surface gravity and metallicity subclasses with 89.5 $\pm$ 0.9% accuracy. We test the dependence of signal-to-noise ratio on classification accuracy and find sources with SNR $\gtrsim$ 60 have $\gtrsim$ 95% accuracy. We also find that zy-band plays the most prominent role in the RF model, with FeH and TiO having the highest feature importance.

Abstract: Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) faces multiple challenges, including significant inter-signer variability and poor generalization to novel sentence structures. Traditional solutions frequently fail to handle these issues efficiently. For overcoming these constraints, we propose a dual-architecture framework. For the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, we propose a Signer-Invariant Conformer that combines convolutions with multi-head self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that captures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging Isharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The proposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on the SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art. On the US task, the transformer model scores a WER of 47.78%, surpassing previous work. In the SignEval 2025 CSLR challenge, our team placed 2nd in the US task and 4th in the SI task, demonstrating the performance of these models. The findings validate our key hypothesis: that developing task-specific networks designed for the particular challenges of CSLR leads to considerable performance improvements and establishes a new baseline for further research.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation exhibits intra- and inter-annotator variability due to ambiguous object boundaries, annotator preferences, expertise, and tools, among other factors. Lesions with ambiguous boundaries, e.g., spiculated or infiltrative nodules, or irregular borders per the ABCD rule, are particularly prone to disagreement and are often associated with malignancy. In this work, we curate IMA++, the largest multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset, on which we conduct an in-depth study of variability due to annotator, malignancy, tool, and skill factors. We find a statistically significant (p<0.001) association between inter-annotator agreement (IAA), measured using Dice, and the malignancy of skin lesions. We further show that IAA can be accurately predicted directly from dermoscopic images, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.108. Finally, we leverage this association by utilizing IAA as a "soft" clinical feature within a multi-task learning objective, yielding a 4.2% improvement in balanced accuracy averaged across multiple model architectures and across IMA++ and four public dermoscopic datasets.

<title>ProMode: A Speech Prosody Model Conditioned on Acoustic and Textual Inputs</title>

Abstract: Prosody conveys rich emotional and semantic information of the speech signal as well as individual idiosyncrasies. We propose a stand-alone model that maps text-to-prosodic features such as F0 and energy and can be used in downstream tasks such as TTS. The ProMode encoder takes as input acoustic features and time-aligned textual content, both are partially masked, and obtains a fixed-length latent prosodic embedding. The decoder predicts acoustics in the masked region using both the encoded prosody input and unmasked textual content. Trained on the GigaSpeech dataset, we compare our method with state-of-the-art style encoders. For F0 and energy predictions, we show consistent improvements for our model at different levels of granularity. We also integrate these predicted prosodic features into a TTS system and conduct perceptual tests, which show higher prosody preference compared to the baselines, demonstrating the model's potential in tasks where prosody modeling is important.

Abstract: Line graphs are an alternative representation of graphs where each vertex of the original (root) graph becomes an edge. However not all graphs have a corresponding root graph, hence the transformation from graphs to line graphs is not invertible. We investigate the case when there is a small perturbation in the space of line graphs, and try to recover the corresponding root graph, essentially defining the inverse of the line graph operation. We propose a linear integer program that edits the smallest number of edges in the line graph, that allow a root graph to be found. We use the spectral norm to theoretically prove that such a pseudo-inverse operation is well behaved. Illustrative empirical experiments on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs show that our theoretical results work in practice.

<title>HyperKD: Distilling Cross-Spectral Knowledge in Masked Autoencoders via Inverse Domain Shift with Spatial-Aware Masking and Specialized Loss</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of foundation models, pretrained on large-scale unlabeled datasets, has emerged as an effective approach in creating adaptable and reusable architectures that can be leveraged for various downstream tasks using satellite observations. However, their direct application to hyperspectral remote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the scarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned representations from a teacher model into a student model for effective development of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical knowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a simpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across different types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building upon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi foundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery. HyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by introducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function tailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral domain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for geospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly improves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction fidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction, underpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the binding conformation of small-molecule ligands to protein targets is a critical step in rational drug design. Although recent deep learning-based docking surpasses traditional methods in speed and accuracy, many approaches rely on graph representations and language model-inspired encoders while neglecting critical geometric information, resulting in inaccurate pocket localization and unrealistic binding conformations. In this study, we introduce CWFBind, a weighted, fast, and accurate docking method based on local curvature features. Specifically, we integrate local curvature descriptors during the feature extraction phase to enrich the geometric representation of both proteins and ligands, complementing existing chemical, sequence, and structural features. Furthermore, we embed degree-aware weighting mechanisms into the message passing process, enhancing the model's ability to capture spatial structural distinctions and interaction strengths. To address the class imbalance challenge in pocket prediction, CWFBind employs a ligand-aware dynamic radius strategy alongside an enhanced loss function, facilitating more precise identification of binding regions and key residues. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CWFBind achieves competitive performance across multiple docking benchmarks, offering a balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Sign language, which contains hand movements, facial expressions and bodily gestures, is a significant medium for communicating with hard-of-hearing people. A well-trained sign language community communicates easily, but those who don't know sign language face significant challenges. Recognition and generation are basic communication methods between hearing and hard-of-hearing individuals. Despite progress in recognition, sign language generation still needs to be explored. The Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Network (ProGAN) excels at producing high-quality images, while the Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) generates feature-rich images at medium resolutions. Balancing resolution and detail is crucial for sign language image generation. We are developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant that combines both models to generate feature-rich, high-resolution, and class-conditional sign language images. Our modified Attention-based model generates high-quality images of Indian Sign Language letters, numbers, and words, outperforming the traditional ProGAN in Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), with improvements of 3.2 and 30.12, respectively. Additionally, we are publishing a large dataset incorporating high-quality images of Indian Sign Language alphabets, numbers, and 129 words.

<title>DeepWKB: Learning WKB Expansions of Invariant Distributions for Stochastic Systems</title>

arXiv:2508.09529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning method, called DeepWKB, for estimating the invariant distribution of randomly perturbed systems via its Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation $u_\epsilon(x) = Q(\epsilon)^{-1} Z_\epsilon(x) \exp\{-V(x)/\epsilon\}$, where $V$ is known as the quasi-potential, $\epsilon$ denotes the noise strength, and $Q(\epsilon)$ is the normalization factor. By utilizing both Monte Carlo data and the partial differential equations satisfied by $V$ and $Z_\epsilon$, the DeepWKB method computes $V$ and $Z_\epsilon$ separately. This enables an approximation of the invariant distribution in the singular regime where $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small, which remains a significant challenge for most existing methods. Moreover, the DeepWKB method is applicable to higher-dimensional stochastic systems whose deterministic counterparts admit non-trivial attractors. In particular, it provides a scalable and flexible alternative for computing the quasi-potential, which plays a key role in the analysis of rare events, metastability, and the stochastic stability of complex systems.

<title>Emergence of Hierarchies in Multi-Agent Self-Organizing Systems Pursuing a Joint Objective</title>

Abstract: Multi-agent self-organizing systems (MASOS) exhibit key characteristics including scalability, adaptability, flexibility, and robustness, which have contributed to their extensive application across various fields. However, the self-organizing nature of MASOS also introduces elements of unpredictability in their emergent behaviors. This paper focuses on the emergence of dependency hierarchies during task execution, aiming to understand how such hierarchies arise from agents' collective pursuit of the joint objective, how they evolve dynamically, and what factors govern their development. To investigate this phenomenon, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is employed to train MASOS for a collaborative box-pushing task. By calculating the gradients of each agent's actions in relation to the states of other agents, the inter-agent dependencies are quantified, and the emergence of hierarchies is analyzed through the aggregation of these dependencies. Our results demonstrate that hierarchies emerge dynamically as agents work towards a joint objective, with these hierarchies evolving in response to changing task requirements. Notably, these dependency hierarchies emerge organically in response to the shared objective, rather than being a consequence of pre-configured rules or parameters that can be fine-tuned to achieve specific results. Furthermore, the emergence of hierarchies is influenced by the task environment and network initialization conditions. Additionally, hierarchies in MASOS emerge from the dynamic interplay between agents' "Talent" and "Effort" within the "Environment." "Talent" determines an agent's initial influence on collective decision-making, while continuous "Effort" within the "Environment" enables agents to shift their roles and positions within the system.

<title>HierMoE: Accelerating MoE Training with Hierarchical Token Deduplication and Expert Swap</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09591</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.09591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sparsely activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) transformer has become a common architecture for large language models (LLMs) due to its sparsity, which requires fewer computational demands while easily scaling the model size. In MoE models, each MoE layer requires to dynamically choose tokens to activate particular experts for computation while the activated experts may not be located in the same device or GPU as the token. However, this leads to substantial communication and load imbalances across all GPUs, which obstructs the scalability of distributed systems within a GPU cluster. To this end, we introduce HierMoE to accelerate the training of MoE models by two topology-aware techniques: 1) token deduplication to reduce the communication traffic, and 2) expert swap to balance the workloads among all GPUs. To enable the above two proposed approaches to be more general, we build theoretical models aimed at achieving the best token duplication and expert swap strategy under different model configurations and hardware environments. We implement our prototype HierMoE system atop Megatron-LM and conduct experiments on a 32-GPU cluster with DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-30B-A3B models. Experimental results show that our HierMoE achieves $1.55\times$ to $3.32\times$ faster communication and delivers $1.18\times$ to $1.27\times$ faster end-to-end training compared to state-of-the-art MoE training systems, Tutel-2DH, SmartMoE, and Megatron-LM.

Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a fundamental task in database management systems, aiming to predict query results accurately without executing the queries. However, existing techniques either achieve low estimation accuracy or incur high inference latency. Simultaneously achieving high speed and accuracy becomes critical for the cardinality estimation problem. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach called CoDe (Covering with Decompositions) to address this problem. CoDe employs the concept of covering design, which divides the table into multiple smaller, overlapping segments. For each segment, CoDe utilizes tensor decomposition to accurately model its data distribution. Moreover, CoDe introduces innovative algorithms to select the best-fitting distributions for each query, combining them to estimate the final result. By employing multiple models to approximate distributions, CoDe excels in effectively modeling discrete distributions and ensuring computational efficiency. Notably, experimental results show that our method represents a significant advancement in cardinality estimation, achieving state-of-the-art levels of both estimation accuracy and inference efficiency. Across various datasets, CoDe achieves absolute accuracy in estimating more than half of the queries.

Abstract: As intelligent robots become more integrated into human environments, there is a growing need for intuitive and reliable Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) interfaces that are adaptable and more natural to interact with. Traditional robot control methods often require users to adapt to interfaces or memorize predefined commands, limiting usability in dynamic, unstructured environments. This paper presents a novel framework that bridges natural language understanding and robotic execution by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees. This integration enables robots to interpret natural language instructions given by users and translate them into executable actions by activating domain-specific plugins. The system supports scalable and modular integration, with a primary focus on perception-based functionalities, such as person tracking and hand gesture recognition. To evaluate the system, a series of real-world experiments was conducted across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is practical in real-world scenarios, with an average cognition-to-execution accuracy of approximately 94%, making a significant contribution to HRI systems and robots. The complete source code of the framework is publicly available at https://github.com/snt-arg/robot_suite.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) within the framework of probabilistic numerics offers a principled approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty arising from discretization. By leveraging Gaussian process regression and imposing the governing PDE as a constraint at a finite set of collocation points, probabilistic numerics delivers mesh-free solutions at arbitrary locations. However, the high computational cost, which scales cubically with the number of collocation points, remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for large-scale or high-dimensional problems. We propose a scalable enhancement to this paradigm through two key innovations. First, we develop a stochastic dual descent algorithm that reduces the per-iteration complexity from cubic to linear in the number of collocation points, enabling tractable inference. Second, we exploit a clustering-based active learning strategy that adaptively selects collocation points to maximize information gain while minimizing computational expense. Together, these contributions result in an $h$-adaptive probabilistic solver that can scale to a large number of collocation points. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solver on benchmark PDEs, including two- and three-dimensional steady-state elliptic problems, as well as a time-dependent parabolic PDE formulated in a space-time setting.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel model architecture for optimizing personalized product search ranking using a multi-task learning (MTL) framework. Our approach uniquely integrates tabular and non-tabular data, leveraging a pre-trained TinyBERT model for semantic embeddings and a novel sampling technique to capture diverse customer behaviors. We evaluate our model against several baselines, including XGBoost, TabNet, FT-Transformer, DCN-V2, and MMoE, focusing on their ability to handle mixed data types and optimize personalized ranking. Additionally, we propose a scalable relevance labeling mechanism based on click-through rates, click positions, and semantic similarity, offering an alternative to traditional human-annotated labels. Experimental results show that combining non-tabular data with advanced embedding techniques in multi-task learning paradigm significantly enhances model performance. Ablation studies further underscore the benefits of incorporating relevance labels, fine-tuning TinyBERT layers, and TinyBERT query-product embedding interactions. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving improved personalized product search ranking.

Abstract: Increasing diversity in language models is a challenging yet essential objective. A common approach is to raise the decoding temperature. In this work, we investigate this approach through a simplistic yet common case to provide insights into why decreasing temperature can improve quality (Precision), while increasing it often fails to boost coverage (Recall). Our analysis reveals that for a model to be effectively tunable through temperature adjustments, it must be trained toward coverage. To address this, we propose rethinking loss functions in language models by leveraging the Precision-Recall framework. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves a substantially better trade-off between Precision and Recall than merely combining negative log-likelihood training with temperature scaling. These findings offer a pathway toward more versatile and robust language modeling techniques.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) application providers rely on Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and roaming infrastructures to deliver their services globally. In this complex ecosystem, where the end-to-end communication path traverses multiple entities, it has become increasingly challenging to guarantee communication availability and reliability. Further, most platform operators use a reactive approach to communication issues, responding to user complaints only after incidents have become severe, compromising service quality. This paper presents our experience in the design and deployment of ANCHOR -- an unsupervised anomaly detection solution for the IoT connectivity service of a large global roaming platform. ANCHOR assists engineers by filtering vast amounts of data to identify potential problematic clients (i.e., those with connectivity issues affecting several of their IoT devices), enabling proactive issue resolution before the service is critically impacted. We first describe the IoT service, infrastructure, and network visibility of the IoT connectivity provider we operate. Second, we describe the main challenges and operational requirements for designing an unsupervised anomaly detection solution on this platform. Following these guidelines, we propose different statistical rules, and machine- and deep-learning models for IoT verticals anomaly detection based on passive signaling traffic. We describe the steps we followed working with the operational teams on the design and evaluation of our solution on the operational platform, and report an evaluation on operational IoT customers.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a rising trend in social-sensor cloud identity cloning incidents. However, existing approaches suffer from unsatisfactory performance, a lack of solutions for detecting duplicated accounts, and a lack of large-scale evaluations on real-world datasets. We introduce a novel method for detecting identity cloning in social-sensor cloud service providers. Our proposed technique consists of two primary components: 1) a similar identity detection method and 2) a cryptography-based authentication protocol. Initially, we developed a weakly supervised deep forest model to identify similar identities using non-privacy-sensitive user profile features provided by the service. Subsequently, we designed a cryptography-based authentication protocol to verify whether similar identities were generated by the same provider. Our extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate the feasibility and superior performance of our technique compared to current state-of-the-art identity clone detection methods.

Abstract: This study investigates the implementation and efficacy of DeputyDev, an AI-powered code review assistant developed to address inefficiencies in the software development process. The process of code review is highly inefficient for several reasons, such as it being a time-consuming process, inconsistent feedback, and review quality not being at par most of the time. Using our telemetry data, we observed that at TATA 1mg, pull request (PR) processing exhibits significant inefficiencies, with average pick-up and review times of 73 and 82 hours, respectively, resulting in a 6.2 day closure cycle. The review cycle was marked by prolonged iterative communication between the reviewing and submitting parties. Research from the University of California, Irvine indicates that interruptions can lead to an average of 23 minutes of lost focus, critically affecting code quality and timely delivery. To address these challenges, we developed DeputyDev's PR review capabilities by providing automated, contextual code reviews. We conducted a rigorous double-controlled A/B experiment involving over 200 engineers to evaluate DeputyDev's impact on review times. The results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in both average per PR (23.09%) and average per-line-of-code (40.13%) review durations. After implementing safeguards to exclude outliers, DeputyDev has been effectively rolled out across the entire organisation. Additionally, it has been made available to external companies as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution, currently supporting the daily work of numerous engineering professionals. This study explores the implementation and effectiveness of AI-assisted code reviews in improving development workflow timelines and code.

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimodal medical imaging data presents significant storage and transmission challenges, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings. We propose NEURAL, a novel framework that addresses this by using semantics-guided data compression. Our approach repurposes cross-attention scores between the image and its radiological report from a fine-tuned generative vision-language model to structurally prune chest X-rays, preserving only diagnostically critical regions. This process transforms the image into a highly compressed, graph representation. This unified graph-based representation fuses the pruned visual graph with a knowledge graph derived from the clinical report, creating a universal data structure that simplifies downstream modeling. Validated on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus dataset for pneumonia detection, NEURAL achieves a 93.4-97.7\% reduction in image data size while maintaining a high diagnostic performance of 0.88-0.95 AUC, outperforming other baseline models that use uncompressed data. By creating a persistent, task-agnostic data asset, NEURAL resolves the trade-off between data size and clinical utility, enabling efficient workflows and teleradiology without sacrificing performance. Our NEURAL code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/NEURAL.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly invasive brain tumor with rapid progression rates. Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection. However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular, graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms baseline methods and demonstrates robustness in incomplete or missing data scenarios, contributing to the development of virtual biopsy tools for rapid diagnostics. Our source code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/MMSN/.

<title>Structured Kernel Regression VAE: A Computationally Efficient Surrogate for GP-VAEs in ICA</title>

Abstract: The interpretability of generative models is considered a key factor in demonstrating their effectiveness and controllability. The generated data are believed to be determined by latent variables that are not directly observable. Therefore, disentangling, decoupling, decomposing, causal inference, or performing Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the latent variable space helps uncover the independent factors that influence the attributes or features affecting the generated outputs, thereby enhancing the interpretability of generative models. As a generative model, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) combine with variational Bayesian inference algorithms. Using VAEs, the inverse process of ICA can be equivalently framed as a variational inference process. In some studies, Gaussian processes (GPs) have been introduced as priors for each dimension of latent variables in VAEs, structuring and separating each dimension from temporal or spatial perspectives, and encouraging different dimensions to control various attributes of the generated data. However, GPs impose a significant computational burden, resulting in substantial resource consumption when handling large datasets. Essentially, GPs model different temporal or spatial structures through various kernel functions. Structuring the priors of latent variables via kernel functions-so that different kernel functions model the correlations among sequence points within different latent dimensions-is at the core of achieving disentanglement in VAEs. The proposed Structured Kernel Regression VAE (SKR-VAE) leverages this core idea in a more efficient way, avoiding the costly kernel matrix inversion required in GPs. This research demonstrates that, while maintaining ICA performance, SKR-VAE achieves greater computational efficiency and significantly reduced computational burden compared to GP-VAE.

Abstract: Large language models trained with reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards tend to trade accuracy for length--inflating response lengths to achieve gains in accuracy. While longer answers may be warranted for harder problems, many tokens are merely "filler": repetitive, verbose text that makes no real progress. We introduce GFPO (Group Filtered Policy Optimization), which curbs this length explosion by sampling larger groups per problem during training and filtering responses to train on based on two key metrics: (1) response length and (2) token efficiency: reward per token ratio. By sampling more at training time, we teach models to think less at inference time. On the Phi-4-reasoning model, GFPO cuts GRPO's length inflation by 46-71% across challenging STEM and coding benchmarks (AIME 24/25, GPQA, Omni-MATH, LiveCodeBench) while maintaining accuracy. Optimizing for reward per token further increases reductions in length inflation to 71-85%. We also propose Adaptive Difficulty GFPO, which dynamically allocates more training resources to harder problems based on real-time difficulty estimates, improving the balance between computational efficiency and accuracy especially on difficult questions. GFPO demonstrates that increased training-time compute directly translates to reduced test-time compute--a simple yet effective trade-off for efficient reasoning.

Abstract: Recently, we can observe a significant increase of the phishing attacks in the Internet. In a typical phishing attack, the attacker sets up a malicious website that looks similar to the legitimate website in order to obtain the end-users' information. This may cause the leakage of the sensitive information and the financial loss for the end-users. To avoid such attacks, the early detection of these websites' URLs is vital and necessary. Previous researchers have proposed many machine learning algorithms to distinguish the phishing URLs from the legitimate ones. In this paper, we would like to enhance these machine learning algorithms from the perspective of feature selection. We propose a novel method to incorporate the keyword features with the traditional features. This method is applied on multiple traditional machine learning algorithms and the experimental results have shown this method is useful and effective. On average, this method can reduce the classification error by 30% for the large dataset. Moreover, its enhancement is more significant for the small dataset. In addition, this method extracts the information from the URL and does not rely on the additional information provided by the third-part service. The best result for the machine learning algorithm using our proposed method has achieved the accuracy of 99.68%.

<title>Improving the Speaker Anonymization Evaluation's Robustness to Target Speakers with Adversarial Learning</title>

Abstract: The current privacy evaluation for speaker anonymization often overestimates privacy when a same-gender target selection algorithm (TSA) is used, although this TSA leaks the speaker's gender and should hence be more vulnerable. We hypothesize that this occurs because the evaluation does not account for the fact that anonymized speech contains information from both the source and target speakers. To address this, we propose to add a target classifier that measures the influence of target speaker information in the evaluation, which can also be removed with adversarial learning. Experiments demonstrate that this approach is effective for multiple anonymizers, particularly when using a same-gender TSA, leading to a more reliable assessment.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and physical information just from dynamic multi-view videos in the absence of any human labels. By leveraging physics-informed losses as soft constraints or integrating simple physics models into neural nets, existing works often fail to learn complex motion physics, or doing so requires additional labels such as object types or masks. We propose a new framework named TRACE to model the motion physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes. The key novelty of our method is that, by formulating each 3D point as a rigid particle with size and orientation in space, we directly learn a translation rotation dynamics system for each particle, explicitly estimating a complete set of physical parameters to govern the particle's motion over time. Extensive experiments on three existing dynamic datasets and one newly created challenging synthetic datasets demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method over baselines in the task of future frame extrapolation. A nice property of our framework is that multiple objects or parts can be easily segmented just by clustering the learned physical parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalizable method for 3D surface reconstruction from raw point clouds or pre-estimated 3D Gaussians by 3DGS from RGB images. Unlike existing coordinate-based methods which are often computationally intensive when rendering explicit surfaces, our proposed method, named RayletDF, introduces a new technique called raylet distance field, which aims to directly predict surface points from query rays. Our pipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet distance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender. These components work together to extract fine-grained local geometric features, predict raylet distances, and aggregate multiple predictions to reconstruct precise surface points. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple public real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance in surface reconstruction from point clouds or 3D Gaussians. Most notably, our method achieves exceptional generalization ability, successfully recovering 3D surfaces in a single-forward pass across unseen datasets in testing.

Abstract: We investigate the capabilities of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) in image generations tasks. Our analysis centers on fully quantum implementations of both the generator and discriminator. Through extensive numerical testing of current main architectures, we find that QGANs struggle to generalize across datasets, converging on merely the average representation of the training data. When the output of the generator is a pure-state, we analytically derive a lower bound for the discriminator quality given by the fidelity between the pure-state output of the generator and the target data distribution, thereby providing a theoretical explanation for the limitations observed in current models. Our findings reveal fundamental challenges in the generalization capabilities of existing quantum generative models. While our analysis focuses on QGANs, the results carry broader implications for the performance of related quantum generative models.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications, ensuring their outputs align with human values and safety standards has become critical. The field has developed diverse alignment approaches including traditional fine-tuning methods (RLHF, instruction tuning), post-hoc correction systems, and inference-time interventions, each with distinct advantages and limitations. However, the lack of unified evaluation frameworks makes it difficult to systematically compare these paradigms and guide deployment decisions. This paper introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation of alignment techniques for LLMs, a comprehensive evaluation framework that provides a systematic comparison across all major alignment paradigms. Our framework assesses methods along four key dimensions: alignment detection, alignment quality, computational efficiency, and robustness. Through experiments across diverse base models and alignment strategies, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in identifying strengths and limitations of current state-of-the-art models, providing valuable insights for future research directions.

<title>Stable Diffusion Models are Secretly Good at Visual In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) in natural language processing (NLP) have demonstrated great potential for in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to leverage a few sets of example prompts to adapt to various tasks without having to explicitly update the model weights. ICL has recently been explored for computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL). Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by 8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv, respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task better and further improve the performance.

Abstract: The vocabulary used by language models (LM) - defined by the tokenizer - plays a key role in text generation quality. However, its impact remains under-explored in radiology. In this work, we address this gap by systematically comparing general, medical, and domain-specific tokenizers on the task of radiology report summarisation across three imaging modalities. We also investigate scenarios with and without LM pre-training on PubMed abstracts. Our findings demonstrate that medical and domain-specific vocabularies outperformed widely used natural language alternatives when models are trained from scratch. Pre-training partially mitigates performance differences between tokenizers, whilst the domain-specific tokenizers achieve the most favourable results. Domain-specific tokenizers also reduce memory requirements due to smaller vocabularies and shorter sequences. These results demonstrate that adapting the vocabulary of LMs to the clinical domain provides practical benefits, including improved performance and reduced computational demands, making such models more accessible and effective for both research and real-world healthcare settings.

<title>Neural Bandit Based Optimal LLM Selection for a Pipeline of Tasks</title>

Abstract: With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) for a variety of tasks, there has been a growing interest in strategies that can predict which out of a set of LLMs will yield a successful answer at low cost. This problem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft allow users to easily create custom LLM "assistants" specialized to particular types of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized and difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often benefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can then be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask. For example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first select an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary, and then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from the summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms, this setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of each LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus, unlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly affects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs, creating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted for during selection. We propose a neural contextual bandit-based algorithm that trains neural networks that model LLM success on each subtask in an online manner, thus learning to guide the LLM selections for the different subtasks, even in the absence of historical LLM performance data. Experiments on telecommunications question answering and medical diagnosis prediction datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other LLM selection algorithms.

Abstract: The creation of human-like humanoid robots is hindered by a fundamental fragmentation: data processing and learning algorithms are rarely universal across different robot morphologies. This paper introduces the Generalized Behavior Cloning (GBC) framework, a comprehensive and unified solution designed to solve this end-to-end challenge. GBC establishes a complete pathway from human motion to robot action through three synergistic innovations. First, an adaptive data pipeline leverages a differentiable IK network to automatically retarget any human MoCap data to any humanoid. Building on this foundation, our novel DAgger-MMPPO algorithm with its MMTransformer architecture learns robust, high-fidelity imitation policies. To complete the ecosystem, the entire framework is delivered as an efficient, open-source platform based on Isaac Lab, empowering the community to deploy the full workflow via simple configuration scripts. We validate the power and generality of GBC by training policies on multiple heterogeneous humanoids, demonstrating excellent performance and transfer to novel motions. This work establishes the first practical and unified pathway for creating truly generalized humanoid controllers.

Abstract: We present Story2Board, a training-free framework for expressive storyboard generation from natural language. Existing methods narrowly focus on subject identity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial composition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we introduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components: Latent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across panels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual features between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these mechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning, enabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet consistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf language model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts. To evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain narratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded storytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene Diversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards. Our qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that Story2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging storyboards than existing baselines.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has been utilized as a promising self-supervised learning approach to extract meaningful representations from unlabeled data. The majority of these methods take advantage of data-augmentation techniques to create diverse views from the original input. However, optimizing augmentations and their parameters for generating more effective views in contrastive learning frameworks is often resource-intensive and time-consuming. While several strategies have been proposed for automatically generating new views in computer vision, research in other domains, such as time-series biobehavioral data, remains limited. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet powerful module for automatic view generation in contrastive learning frameworks applied to time-series biobehavioral data, which is essential for modern health care, termed learning views for time-series data (LEAVES). This proposed module employs adversarial training to learn augmentation hyperparameters within contrastive learning frameworks. We assess the efficacy of our method on multiple time-series datasets using two well-known contrastive learning frameworks, namely SimCLR and BYOL. Across four diverse biobehavioral datasets, LEAVES requires only approximately 20 learnable parameters -- dramatically fewer than the about 580k parameters demanded by frameworks like ViewMaker, a previously proposed adversarially trained convolutional module in contrastive learning, while achieving competitive and often superior performance to existing baseline methods. Crucially, these efficiency gains are obtained without extensive manual hyperparameter tuning, which makes LEAVES particularly suitable for large-scale or real-time healthcare applications that demand both accuracy and practicality.

Abstract: Efficient and sustainable power generation is a crucial concern in the energy sector. In particular, thermal power plants grapple with accurately predicting steam mass flow, which is crucial for operational efficiency and cost reduction. In this study, we use a parallel hybrid neural network architecture that combines a parametrized quantum circuit and a conventional feed-forward neural network specifically designed for time-series prediction in industrial settings to enhance predictions of steam mass flow 15 minutes into the future. Our results show that the parallel hybrid model outperforms standalone classical and quantum models, achieving more than 5.7 and 4.9 times lower mean squared error loss on the test set after training compared to pure classical and pure quantum networks, respectively. Furthermore, the hybrid model demonstrates smaller relative errors between the ground truth and the model predictions on the test set, up to 2 times better than the pure classical model. These findings contribute to the broader scientific understanding of how integrating quantum and classical machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world challenges faced by the energy sector, ultimately leading to optimized power plant operations. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first parallel hybrid quantum-classical architecture deployed on a real-world power-plant dataset, illustrating how near-term quantum resources can already augment classical analytics in the energy sector.

Abstract: Stochastic optimization is a widely used approach for optimization under uncertainty, where uncertain input parameters are modeled by random variables. Exact or approximation algorithms have been obtained for several fundamental problems in this area. However, a significant limitation of this approach is that it requires full knowledge of the underlying probability distributions. Can we still get good (approximation) algorithms if these distributions are unknown, and the algorithm needs to learn them through repeated interactions? In this paper, we resolve this question for a large class of ''monotone'' stochastic problems, by providing a generic online learning algorithm with $\sqrt{T\log(T)}$ regret relative to the best approximation algorithm (under known distributions). Importantly, our online algorithm works in a semi-bandit setting, where in each period, the algorithm only observes samples from the random variables that were actually probed. Moreover, our result extends to settings with censored and binary feedback, where the policy only observes truncated or thresholded versions of the probed variables. Our framework applies to several fundamental problems such as prophet inequality, Pandora's box, stochastic knapsack, single-resource revenue management and sequential posted pricing.

Abstract: Neural algorithmic reasoning aims to capture computations with neural networks by training models to imitate the execution of classical algorithms. While common architectures are expressive enough to contain the correct model in the weight space, current neural reasoners struggle to generalize well on out-of-distribution data. On the other hand, classical computations are not affected by distributional shifts as they can be described as transitions between discrete computational states. In this work, we propose to force neural reasoners to maintain the execution trajectory as a combination of finite predefined states. To achieve this, we separate discrete and continuous data flows and describe the interaction between them. Trained with supervision on the algorithm's state transitions, such models are able to perfectly align with the original algorithm. To show this, we evaluate our approach on multiple algorithmic problems and achieve perfect test scores both in single-task and multitask setups. Moreover, the proposed architectural choice allows us to prove the correctness of the learned algorithms for any test data.

Abstract: High-stakes applications rely on combining Artificial Intelligence (AI) and humans for responsive and reliable decision making. For example, content moderation in social media platforms often employs an AI-human pipeline to promptly remove policy violations without jeopardizing legitimate content. A typical heuristic estimates the risk of incoming content and uses fixed thresholds to decide whether to auto-delete the content (classification) and whether to send it for human review (admission). This approach can be inefficient as it disregards the uncertainty in AI's estimation, the time-varying element of content arrivals and human review capacity, and the selective sampling in the online dataset (humans only review content filtered by the AI).
  In this paper, we introduce a model to capture such an AI-human interplay. In this model, the AI observes contextual information for incoming jobs, makes classification and admission decisions, and schedules admitted jobs for human review. During these reviews, humans observe a job's true cost and may overturn an erroneous AI classification decision. These reviews also serve as new data to train the AI but are delayed due to congestion in the human review system. The objective is to minimize the costs of eventually misclassified jobs.
  We propose a near-optimal learning algorithm that carefully balances the classification loss from a selectively sampled dataset, the idiosyncratic loss of non-reviewed jobs, and the delay loss of having congestion in the human review system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result for online learning in contextual queueing systems. Moreover, numerical experiments based on online comment datasets show that our algorithm can substantially reduce the number of misclassifications compared to existing content moderation practice.

Abstract: M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions, a.k.a. gross substitute valuation functions, play a fundamental role in many fields, including discrete mathematics and economics. In practice, perfect knowledge of M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions is often unavailable a priori, and we can optimize them only interactively based on some feedback. Motivated by such situations, we study online M${}^{\natural}$-concave function maximization problems, which are interactive versions of the problem studied by Murota and Shioura (1999). For the stochastic bandit setting, we present $O(T^{-1/2})$-simple regret and $O(T^{2/3})$-regret algorithms under $T$ times access to unbiased noisy value oracles of M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions. A key to proving these results is the robustness of the greedy algorithm to local errors in M${}^{\natural}$-concave function maximization, which is one of our main technical results. While we obtain those positive results for the stochastic setting, another main result of our work is an impossibility in the adversarial setting. We prove that, even with full-information feedback, no algorithms that run in polynomial time per round can achieve $O(T^{1-c})$ regret for any constant $c > 0$. Our proof is based on a reduction from the matroid intersection problem for three matroids, which would be a novel approach to establishing the hardness in online learning.

Abstract: The growing demands on GPU memory posed by the increasing number of neural network parameters call for training approaches that are more memory-efficient. Previous memory reduction training techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and ReLoRA, face challenges, with LoRA being constrained by its low-rank structure, particularly during intensive tasks like pre-training, and ReLoRA suffering from saddle point issues. In this paper, we propose Sparse Spectral Training (SST) to optimize memory usage for pre-training. SST updates all singular values and selectively updates singular vectors through a multinomial sampling method weighted by the magnitude of the singular values. Furthermore, SST employs singular value decomposition to initialize and periodically reinitialize low-rank parameters, reducing distortion relative to full-rank training compared to other low-rank methods. Through comprehensive testing on both Euclidean and hyperbolic neural networks across various tasks, SST demonstrates its ability to outperform existing memory reduction training methods and is comparable to full-rank training in various cases. On LLaMA-1.3B, with only 18.7\% of the parameters trainable compared to full-rank training (using a rank equivalent to 6\% of the embedding dimension), SST reduces the perplexity gap between other low-rank methods and full-rank training by 97.4\%. This result highlights SST as an effective parameter-efficient technique for model pre-training.

It extends the well-known CIFAR 10/100 dataset with audio samples extracted from three audio corpora, and text data generated using the Gemma-7B Large Language Model (LLM). The LUMA dataset enables the controlled injection of varying types and degrees of uncertainty to achieve and tailor specific experiments and benchmarking initiatives. LUMA is also available as a Python package including the functions for generating multiple variants of the dataset with controlling the diversity of the data, the amount of noise for each modality, and adding out-of-distribution samples. A baseline pre-trained model is also provided alongside three uncertainty quantification methods: Monte-Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensemble, and Reliable Conflictive Multi-View Learning. This comprehensive dataset and its tools are intended to promote and support the development, evaluation, and benchmarking of trustworthy and robust multimodal deep learning approaches. We anticipate that the LUMA dataset will help the research community to design more trustworthy and robust machine learning approaches for safety critical applications. The code and instructions for downloading and processing the dataset can be found at: https://github.com/bezirganyan/LUMA/ .

Abstract: Time series data is a key element of big data analytics, commonly found in domains such as finance, healthcare, climate forecasting, and transportation. In large scale real world settings, such data is often high dimensional and multivariate, requiring advanced forecasting methods that are both accurate and interpretable. Although Transformer based models perform well in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), their lack of explainability limits their use in critical applications. To overcome this, we propose Distributed Lag Transformer (DLFormer), a novel Transformer architecture for explainable and scalable MTSF. DLFormer integrates a distributed lag embedding and a time variable aware learning (TVAL) mechanism to structurally model both local and global temporal dependencies and explicitly capture the influence of past variables on future outcomes. Experiments on ten benchmark and real world datasets show that DLFormer achieves state of the art predictive accuracy while offering robust, interpretable insights into variable wise and temporal dynamics. These results highlight ability of DLFormer to bridge the gap between performance and explainability, making it highly suitable for practical big data forecasting tasks.

Abstract: The Smart Grid (SG) is a critical energy infrastructure that collects real-time electricity usage data to forecast future energy demands using information and communication technologies (ICT). Due to growing concerns about data security and privacy in SGs, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising training framework. FL offers a balance between privacy, efficiency, and accuracy in SGs by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private data from IoT devices. In this survey, we thoroughly review recent advancements in designing FL-based SG systems across three stages: generation, transmission and distribution, and consumption. Additionally, we explore potential vulnerabilities that may arise when implementing FL in these stages. Furthermore, we discuss the gap between state-of-the-art (SOTA) FL research and its practical applications in SGs, and we propose future research directions. Unlike traditional surveys addressing security issues in centralized machine learning methods for SG systems, this survey is the first to specifically examine the applications and security concerns unique to FL-based SG systems. We also introduce FedGridShield, an open-source framework featuring implementations of SOTA attack and defense methods. Our aim is to inspire further research into applications and improvements in the robustness of FL-based SG systems.

Abstract: Understanding the risks posed by extreme rainfall events requires analysis of precipitation fields with high resolution (to assess localized hazards) and extensive historical coverage (to capture sufficient examples of rare occurrences). Radar and mesonet networks provide precipitation fields at 1 km resolution but with limited historical and geographical coverage, while gauge-based records and reanalysis products cover decades of time on a global scale, but only at 30-50 km resolution. To help provide high-resolution precipitation estimates over long time scales, this study presents Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion (WassDiff), a diffusion framework to downscale (super-resolve) precipitation fields from low-resolution gauge and reanalysis products. Crucially, unlike related deep generative models, WassDiff integrates a Wasserstein distribution-matching regularizer to the denoising process to reduce empirical biases at extreme intensities. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that WassDiff quantitatively outperforms existing state-of-the-art generative downscaling methods at recovering extreme weather phenomena such as tropical storms and cold fronts. Case studies further qualitatively demonstrate WassDiff's ability to reproduce realistic fine-scale weather structures and accurate peak intensities. By unlocking decades of high-resolution rainfall information from globally available coarse records, WassDiff offers a practical pathway toward more accurate flood-risk assessments and climate-adaptation planning.

Abstract: Differentiable optimization has attracted significant research interest, particularly for quadratic programming (QP). Existing approaches for differentiating the solution of a QP with respect to its defining parameters often rely on specific integrated solvers. This integration limits their applicability, including their use in neural network architectures and bi-level optimization tasks, restricting users to a narrow selection of solver choices. To address this limitation, we introduce dQP, a modular and solver-agnostic framework for plug-and-play differentiation of virtually any QP solver. Our key theoretical insight is that the solution and its derivative can each be expressed in terms of closely-related and simple linear systems by using the active set at the solution. This insight enables efficient decoupling of the QP's solution, obtained by any solver, from its differentiation. Our open-source, minimal-overhead implementation will be made publicly available and seamlessly integrates with more than 15 state-of-the-art solvers. Comprehensive benchmark experiments demonstrate dQP's robustness and scalability, particularly highlighting its advantages in large-scale sparse problems.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a model to learn a new task by observing a few exemplars in its context. While prevalent in NLP, this capability has recently also been observed in Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings. Prior in-context RL methods, however, require entire episodes in the agent's context. Given that complex environments typically lead to long episodes with sparse rewards, these methods are constrained to simple environments with short episodes. To address these challenges, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer (RA-DT). RA-DT employs an external memory mechanism to store past experiences from which it retrieves only sub-trajectories relevant for the current situation. The retrieval component in RA-DT does not require training and can be entirely domain-agnostic. We evaluate the capabilities of RA-DT on grid-world environments, robotics simulations, and procedurally-generated video games. On grid-worlds, RA-DT outperforms baselines, while using only a fraction of their context length. Furthermore, we illuminate the limitations of current in-context RL methods on complex environments and discuss future directions. To facilitate future research, we release datasets for four of the considered environments.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have displayed remarkable creative prowess and emergence capabilities. Existing empirical studies have revealed a strong connection between these LLMs' impressive emergence abilities and their in-context learning (ICL) capacity, allowing them to solve new tasks using only task-specific prompts without further fine-tuning. On the other hand, existing empirical and theoretical studies also show that there is a linear regularity of the multi-concept encoded semantic representation behind transformer-based LLMs. However, existing theoretical work fail to build up an understanding of the connection between this regularity and the innovative power of ICL. Additionally, prior work often focuses on simplified, unrealistic scenarios involving linear transformers or unrealistic loss functions, and they achieve only linear or sub-linear convergence rates. In contrast, this work provides a fine-grained mathematical analysis to show how transformers leverage the multi-concept semantics of words to enable powerful ICL and excellent out-of-distribution ICL abilities, offering insights into how transformers innovate solutions for certain unseen tasks encoded with multiple cross-concept semantics. Inspired by empirical studies on the linear latent geometry of LLMs, the analysis is based on a concept-based low-noise sparse coding prompt model. Leveraging advanced techniques, this work showcases the exponential 0-1 loss convergence over the highly non-convex training dynamics, which pioneeringly incorporates the challenges of softmax self-attention, ReLU-activated MLPs, and cross-entropy loss. Empirical simulations corroborate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: We consider the approximation of functions by 2-layer neural networks with a small number of hidden weights based on the squared loss and small datasets. Due to the highly non-convex energy landscape, gradient-based training often suffers from local minima. As a remedy, we initialize the hidden weights with samples from a learned proposal distribution, which we parameterize as a deep generative model. To train this model, we exploit the fact that with fixed hidden weights, the optimal output weights solve a linear equation. After learning the generative model, we refine the sampled weights with a gradient-based post-processing in the latent space. Here, we also include a regularization scheme to counteract potential noise. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by numerical examples.

<title>Scalable Out-of-distribution Robustness in the Presence of Unobserved Confounders</title>

Abstract: We consider the task of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, where the distribution shift is due to an unobserved confounder ($Z$) affecting both the covariates ($X$) and the labels ($Y$). This confounding introduces heterogeneity in the predictor, i.e., $P(Y | X) = E_{P(Z | X)}[P(Y | X,Z)]$, making traditional covariate and label shift assumptions unsuitable. OOD generalization differs from traditional domain adaptation in that it does not assume access to the covariate distribution ($X^\text{te}$) of the test samples during training. These conditions create a challenging scenario for OOD robustness: (a) $Z^\text{tr}$ is an unobserved confounder during training, (b) $P^\text{te}(Z) \neq P^\text{tr}(Z)$, (c) $X^\text{te}$ is unavailable during training, and (d) the predictive distribution depends on $P^\text{te}(Z)$. While prior work has developed complex predictors requiring multiple additional variables for identifiability of the latent distribution, we explore a set of identifiability assumptions that yield a surprisingly simple predictor using only a single additional variable. Our approach demonstrates superior empirical performance on several benchmark tasks.

Abstract: We develop the framework of Indirect Query Bayesian Optimization (IQBO), a new class of Bayesian optimization problems where the integrated feedback is given via a conditional expectation of the unknown function $f$ to be optimized. The underlying conditional distribution can be unknown and learned from data. The goal is to find the global optimum of $f$ by adaptively querying and observing in the space transformed by the conditional distribution. This is motivated by real-world applications where one cannot access direct feedback due to privacy, hardware or computational constraints. We propose the Conditional Max-Value Entropy Search (CMES) acquisition function to address this novel setting, and propose a hierarchical search algorithm with multi-resolution feedback to improve computational efficiency. We show regret bounds for our proposed methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on simulated optimization tasks.

Abstract: Cellular traffic forecasting is a critical task that enables network operators to efficiently allocate resources and address anomalies in rapidly evolving environments. The exponential growth of data collected from base stations poses significant challenges to processing and analysis. While machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as powerful tools for handling these large datasets and providing accurate predictions, their environmental impact, particularly in terms of energy consumption, is often overlooked in favor of their predictive capabilities. This study investigates the potential of two bio-inspired models: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Reservoir Computing through Echo State Networks (ESNs) for cellular traffic forecasting. The evaluation focuses on both their predictive performance and energy efficiency. These models are implemented in both centralized and federated settings to analyze their effectiveness and energy consumption in decentralized systems. Additionally, we compare bio-inspired models with traditional architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), to provide a comprehensive evaluation. Using data collected from three diverse locations in Barcelona, Spain, we examine the trade-offs between predictive accuracy and energy demands across these approaches. The results indicate that bio-inspired models, such as SNNs and ESNs, can achieve significant energy savings while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to traditional architectures. Furthermore, federated implementations were tested to evaluate their energy efficiency in decentralized settings compared to centralized systems, particularly in combination with bio-inspired models. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential of bio-inspired models for sustainable and privacy-preserving cellular traffic forecasting.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques in multi-view settings face significant challenges, particularly when integrating heterogeneous data, aligning feature spaces, and managing view-specific biases. These issues are prominent in neuroscience, where data from multiple subjects exposed to the same stimuli are analyzed to uncover brain activity dynamics. In magnetoencephalography (MEG), where signals are captured at the scalp level, estimating the brain's underlying sources is crucial, especially in group studies where sources are assumed to be similar for all subjects. Common methods, such as Multi-View Independent Component Analysis (MVICA), assume identical sources across subjects, but this assumption is often too restrictive due to individual variability and age-related changes. Multi-View Independent Component Analysis with Delays (MVICAD) addresses this by allowing sources to differ up to a temporal delay. However, temporal dilation effects, particularly in auditory stimuli, are common in brain dynamics, making the estimation of time delays alone insufficient. To address this, we propose Multi-View Independent Component Analysis with Delays and Dilations (MVICAD2), which allows sources to differ across subjects in both temporal delays and dilations. We present a model with identifiable sources, derive an approximation of its likelihood in closed form, and use regularization and optimization techniques to enhance performance. Through simulations, we demonstrate that MVICAD2 outperforms existing multi-view ICA methods. We further validate its effectiveness using the Cam-CAN dataset, and showing how delays and dilations are related to aging.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) controls the prediction uncertainty of classification systems by producing a small prediction set, ensuring a predetermined probability that the true class lies within this set. This is commonly done by defining a score, based on the model predictions, and setting a threshold on this score using a validation set. In this study, we address the problem of CP calibration when we only have access to a calibration set with noisy labels. We show how we can estimate the noise-free conformal threshold based on the noisy labeled data. We derive a finite sample coverage guarantee for uniform noise that remains effective even in tasks with a large number of classes. We dub our approach Noise-Aware Conformal Prediction (NACP). We illustrate the performance of the proposed results on several standard image classification datasets with a large number of classes.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Large Language Models has driven demand for effective model compression techniques to reduce memory and computation costs. Low-rank pruning has gained attention for its GPU compatibility across all densities. However, low-rank pruning struggles to match the performance of semi-structured pruning, often doubling perplexity at similar densities. In this paper, we propose Pivoting Factorization (PIFA), a novel lossless meta low-rank representation that unsupervisedly learns a compact form of any low-rank representation, effectively eliminating redundant information. PIFA identifies pivot rows (linearly independent rows) and expresses non-pivot rows as linear combinations, achieving 24.2% additional memory savings and 24.6% faster inference over low-rank layers at rank = 50% of dimension. To mitigate the performance degradation caused by low-rank pruning, we introduce a novel, retraining-free reconstruction method that minimizes error accumulation (M). MPIFA, combining M and PIFA into an end-to-end framework, significantly outperforms existing low-rank pruning methods, and achieves performance comparable to semi-structured pruning, while surpassing it in GPU efficiency and compatibility. Our code is available at https://github.com/biomedical-cybernetics/pivoting-factorization.

Abstract: Linear recurrent neural networks enable powerful long-range sequence modeling with constant memory usage and time-per-token during inference. These architectures hold promise for streaming applications at the edge, but deployment in resource-constrained environments requires hardware-aware optimizations to minimize latency and energy consumption. Unstructured sparsity offers a compelling solution, enabling substantial reductions in compute and memory requirements--when accelerated by compatible hardware platforms. In this paper, we conduct a scaling study to investigate the Pareto front of performance and efficiency across inference compute budgets. We find that highly sparse linear RNNs consistently achieve better efficiency-performance trade-offs than dense baselines, with 2x less compute and 36% less memory at iso-accuracy. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results on a real-time streaming task for audio denoising. By quantizing our sparse models to fixed-point arithmetic and deploying them on the Intel Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip for real-time processing, we translate model compression into tangible gains of 42x lower latency and 149x lower energy consumption compared to a dense model on an edge GPU. Our findings showcase the transformative potential of unstructured sparsity, paving the way for highly efficient recurrent neural networks in real-world, resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: We propose "LEAPS", an algorithm to sample from discrete distributions known up to normalization by learning a rate matrix of a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). LEAPS can be seen as a continuous-time formulation of annealed importance sampling and sequential Monte Carlo methods, extended so that the variance of the importance weights is offset by the inclusion of the CTMC. To derive these importance weights, we introduce a set of Radon-Nikodym derivatives of CTMCs over their path measures. Because the computation of these weights is intractable with standard neural network parameterizations of rate matrices, we devise a new compact representation for rate matrices via what we call "locally equivariant" functions. To parameterize them, we introduce a family of locally equivariant multilayer perceptrons, attention layers, and convolutional networks, and provide an approach to make deep networks that preserve the local equivariance. This property allows us to propose a scalable training algorithm for the rate matrix such that the variance of the importance weights associated to the CTMC are minimal. We demonstrate the efficacy of LEAPS on problems in statistical physics.

Abstract: Learned denoisers play a fundamental role in various signal generation (e.g., diffusion models) and reconstruction (e.g., compressed sensing) architectures, whose success derives from their ability to leverage low-dimensional structure in data. Existing denoising methods, however, either rely on local approximations that require a linear scan of the entire dataset or treat denoising as generic function approximation problems, often sacrificing efficiency and interpretability. We consider the problem of efficiently denoising a new noisy data point sampled from an unknown $d$-dimensional manifold $M \in \mathbb{R}^D$, using only noisy samples. This work proposes a framework for test-time efficient manifold denoising, by framing the concept of "learning-to-denoise" as "learning-to-optimize". We have two technical innovations: (i) online learning methods which learn to optimize over the manifold of clean signals using only noisy data, effectively "growing" an optimizer one sample at a time. (ii) mixed-order methods which guarantee that the learned optimizers achieve global optimality, ensuring both efficiency and near-optimal denoising performance. We corroborate these claims with theoretical analyses of both the complexity and denoising performance of mixed-order traversal. Our experiments on scientific manifolds demonstrate significantly improved complexity-performance tradeoffs compared to nearest neighbor search, which underpins existing provable denoising approaches based on exhaustive search.

Abstract: Steering vectors (SVs) have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting and controlling LLMs, but current methods typically require large contrastive datasets that are often impractical to construct and may capture spurious correlations. We propose directly optimizing SVs through gradient descent on a single training example, and systematically investigate how these SVs generalize. We consider several SV optimization techniques and find that the resulting SVs effectively mediate safety-relevant behaviors in multiple models. Indeed, in experiments on an alignment-faking model, we are able to optimize one-shot SVs that induce harmful behavior on benign examples and whose negations suppress harmful behavior on malign examples. And in experiments on refusal suppression, we demonstrate that one-shot optimized SVs can transfer across inputs, yielding a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9%. Furthermore, we extend work on "emergent misalignment" and show that SVs optimized to induce a model to write vulnerable code cause the model to respond harmfully on unrelated open-ended prompts. Finally, we use one-shot SV optimization to investigate how an instruction-tuned LLM recovers from outputting false information, and find that this ability is independent of the model's explicit verbalization that the information was false. Overall, our findings suggest that optimizing SVs on a single example can mediate a wide array of misaligned behaviors in LLMs. Code can be found at https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-repro and https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-misalignment.

Abstract: We propose a novel Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) method that mitigates the rigidity of fixed reward structures and the limited flexibility of implicit reward regularization. Building on the Maximum Entropy IRL framework, our approach incorporates a squared temporal-difference (TD) regularizer with adaptive targets that evolve dynamically during training, thereby imposing adaptive bounds on recovered rewards and promoting robust decision-making. To capture richer return information, we integrate distributional RL into the learning process. Empirically, our method achieves expert-level performance on complex MuJoCo tasks, surpassing baseline methods on the Humanoid task with 3 demonstrations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the approach and provide insights into reward dynamics in imitation learning.

Abstract: We provide a general framework for learning diffusion bridges that transport prior to target distributions. It includes existing diffusion models for generative modeling, but also underdamped versions with degenerate diffusion matrices, where the noise only acts in certain dimensions. Extending previous findings, our framework allows to rigorously show that score matching in the underdamped case is indeed equivalent to maximizing a lower bound on the likelihood. Motivated by superior convergence properties and compatibility with sophisticated numerical integration schemes of underdamped stochastic processes, we propose \emph{underdamped diffusion bridges}, where a general density evolution is learned rather than prescribed by a fixed noising process. We apply our method to the challenging task of sampling from unnormalized densities without access to samples from the target distribution. Across a diverse range of sampling problems, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, notably outperforming alternative methods, while requiring significantly fewer discretization steps and no hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to bias mitigation in large language models (LLMs) by applying steering vectors to modify model activations in forward passes. We compute 8 steering vectors, each corresponding to a different social bias axis, such as age, gender, or race, on a training subset of the BBQ dataset and compare the effectiveness of these to 3 additional bias mitigation methods across 4 datasets. When optimized on the BBQ dataset, our individually tuned steering vectors achieve average improvements of 12.8% on BBQ, 8.3% on CLEAR-Bias, and 1% on StereoSet, and show improvements over prompting and Self-Debias in all cases, and improvements over fine-tuning in 12 out of 17 evaluations. In addition, steering vectors showed the lowest impact on MMLU scores of the four bias mitigation methods tested. The work presents the first systematic investigation of steering vectors for bias mitigation, and we demonstrate that they are a powerful and computationally efficient strategy for reducing bias in LLMs, with broader implications for enhancing AI safety.

Abstract: Extensive compute and memory requirements limit the deployment of large language models (LLMs) on any hardware. Compression methods, such as pruning, can reduce model size, which in turn reduces resource requirements. State-of-the-art pruning is based on coarse-grained methods. They are time-consuming and inherently remove critical model parameters, adversely impacting the quality of the pruned model. This paper introduces projection pruning, a novel fine-grained method for pruning LLMs. In addition, LLM projection pruning is enhanced by a new approach we refer to as composite projection pruning - the synergistic combination of unstructured pruning that retains accuracy and structured pruning that reduces model size. We develop Mosaic, a novel system to create and deploy pruned LLMs using composite projection pruning. Mosaic is evaluated using a range of performance and quality metrics on multiple hardware platforms, LLMs, and datasets. Mosaic is 7.19x faster in producing models than existing approaches. Mosaic models achieve up to 84.2% lower perplexity and 31.4% higher accuracy than models obtained from coarse-grained pruning. Up to 67% faster inference and 68% lower GPU memory use is noted for Mosaic models. Mosaic is available for public use from https://github.com/blessonvar/Mosaic

Abstract: Multimodal data are often incomplete and exhibit Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics in real-world scenarios. These inherent limitations lead to both modality heterogeneity through partial modality absence and data heterogeneity from distribution divergence, creating fundamental challenges for effective federated learning (FL). To address these coupled challenges, we propose FedRecon, the first method targeting simultaneous missing modality reconstruction and Non-IID adaptation in multimodal FL. Our approach first employs a lightweight Multimodal Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) to reconstruct missing modalities while preserving cross-modal consistency. Distinct from conventional imputation methods, we achieve sample-level alignment through a novel distribution mapping mechanism that guarantees both data consistency and completeness. Additionally, we introduce a strategy employing global generator freezing to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which in turn mitigates Non-IID fluctuations. Extensive evaluations on multimodal datasets demonstrate FedRecon's superior performance in modality reconstruction under Non-IID conditions, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Density ratio estimation is fundamental to tasks involving $f$-divergences, yet existing methods often fail under significantly different distributions or inadequately overlapping supports -- the density-chasm and the support-chasm problems. Additionally, prior approaches yield divergent time scores near boundaries, leading to instability. We design $\textbf{D}^3\textbf{RE}$, a unified framework for \textbf{robust}, \textbf{stable} and \textbf{efficient} density ratio estimation. We propose the dequantified diffusion bridge interpolant (DDBI), which expands support coverage and stabilizes time scores via diffusion bridges and Gaussian dequantization. Building on DDBI, the proposed dequantified Schr{\"o}dinger bridge interpolant (DSBI) incorporates optimal transport to solve the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge problem, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Our method offers uniform approximation and bounded time scores in theory, and outperforms baselines empirically in mutual information and density estimation tasks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of machine-learning models that operate on graph-structured data. Their expressive power is intimately related to logics that are invariant under graded bisimilarity. Current proposals for recurrent GNNs either assume that the graph size is given to the model, or suffer from a lack of termination guarantees. In this paper, we propose a halting mechanism for recurrent GNNs. We prove that our halting model can express all node classifiers definable in graded modal mu-calculus, even for the standard GNN variant that is oblivious to the graph size. To prove our main result, we develop a new approximate semantics for graded mu-calculus, which we believe to be of independent interest. We leverage this new semantics into a new model-checking algorithm, called the counting algorithm, which is oblivious to the graph size. In a final step we show that the counting algorithm can be implemented on a halting recurrent GNN.

Abstract: One explanation for the strong generalization ability of neural networks is implicit bias. Yet, the definition and mechanism of implicit bias in non-linear contexts remains little understood. In this work, we propose to characterize implicit bias by the count of connected regions in the input space with the same predicted label. Compared with parameter-dependent metrics (e.g., norm or normalized margin), region count can be better adapted to nonlinear, overparameterized models, because it is determined by the function mapping and is invariant to reparametrization. Empirically, we found that small region counts align with geometrically simple decision boundaries and correlate well with good generalization performance. We also observe that good hyper-parameter choices such as larger learning rates and smaller batch sizes can induce small region counts. We further establish the theoretical connections and explain how larger learning rate can induce small region counts in neural networks.

Abstract: Actor-critic methods for decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) facilitate collaborative optimal decision making without centralized coordination, thus enabling a wide range of applications in practice. To date, however, most theoretical convergence studies for existing actor-critic decentralized MARL methods are limited to the guarantee of a stationary solution under the linear function approximation. This leaves a significant gap between the highly successful use of deep neural actor-critic for decentralized MARL in practice and the current theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we make the first attempt to develop a deep neural actor-critic method for decentralized MARL, where both the actor and critic components are inherently non-linear. We show that our proposed method enjoys a global optimality guarantee with a finite-time convergence rate of O(1/T), where T is the total iteration times. This marks the first global convergence result for deep neural actor-critic methods in the MARL literature. We also conduct extensive numerical experiments, which verify our theoretical results.

<title>Gradual Transition from Bellman Optimality Operator to Bellman Operator in Online Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: For continuous action spaces, actor-critic methods are widely used in online reinforcement learning (RL). However, unlike RL algorithms for discrete actions, which generally model the optimal value function using the Bellman optimality operator, RL algorithms for continuous actions typically model Q-values for the current policy using the Bellman operator. These algorithms for continuous actions rely exclusively on policy updates for improvement, which often results in low sample efficiency. This study examines the effectiveness of incorporating the Bellman optimality operator into actor-critic frameworks. Experiments in a simple environment show that modeling optimal values accelerates learning but leads to overestimation bias. To address this, we propose an annealing approach that gradually transitions from the Bellman optimality operator to the Bellman operator, thereby accelerating learning while mitigating bias. Our method, combined with TD3 and SAC, significantly outperforms existing approaches across various locomotion and manipulation tasks, demonstrating improved performance and robustness to hyperparameters related to optimality. The code for this study is available at https://github.com/motokiomura/annealed-q-learning.

Abstract: The LifeTime Value (LTV) prediction, which endeavors to forecast the cumulative purchase contribution of a user to a particular item, remains a vital challenge that advertisers are keen to resolve. A precise LTV prediction system enhances the alignment of user interests with meticulously designed advertisements, thereby generating substantial profits for advertisers. Nonetheless, this issue is complicated by the paucity of data typically observed in real-world advertising scenarios. The purchase rate among registered users is often as critically low as 0.1%, resulting in a dataset where the majority of users make only several purchases. Consequently, there is insufficient supervisory signal for effectively training the LTV prediction model. An additional challenge emerges from the interdependencies among tasks with high correlation. It is a common practice to estimate a user's contribution to a game over a specified temporal interval. Varying the lengths of these intervals corresponds to distinct predictive tasks, which are highly correlated. For instance, predictions over a 7-day period are heavily reliant on forecasts made over a 3-day period, where exceptional cases can adversely affect the accuracy of both tasks. In order to comprehensively address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce an innovative framework denoted as Graph-Represented Pareto-Optimal LifeTime Value prediction (GRePO-LTV). Graph representation learning is initially employed to address the issue of data scarcity. Subsequently, Pareto-Optimization is utilized to manage the interdependence of prediction tasks.

Abstract: Decision trees are widely used for interpretable machine learning due to their clearly structured reasoning process. However, this structure belies a challenge we refer to as predictive equivalence: a given tree's decision boundary can be represented by many different decision trees. The presence of models with identical decision boundaries but different evaluation processes makes model selection challenging. The models will have different variable importance and behave differently in the presence of missing values, but most optimization procedures will arbitrarily choose one such model to return. We present a boolean logical representation of decision trees that does not exhibit predictive equivalence and is faithful to the underlying decision boundary. We apply our representation to several downstream machine learning tasks. Using our representation, we show that decision trees are surprisingly robust to test-time missingness of feature values; we address predictive equivalence's impact on quantifying variable importance; and we present an algorithm to optimize the cost of reaching predictions.

Abstract: Despite recent efforts, neural networks still struggle to learn in non-stationary environments, and our understanding of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is far from complete. In this work, we perform a systematic study on the impact of model scale and the degree of feature learning in continual learning. We reconcile existing contradictory observations on scale in the literature, by differentiating between lazy and rich training regimes through a variable parameterization of the architecture. We show that increasing model width is only beneficial when it reduces the amount of feature learning, yielding more laziness. Using the framework of dynamical mean field theory, we then study the infinite width dynamics of the model in the feature learning regime and characterize CF, extending prior theoretical results limited to the lazy regime. We study the intricate relationship between feature learning, task non-stationarity, and forgetting, finding that high feature learning is only beneficial with highly similar tasks. We identify a transition modulated by task similarity where the model exits an effectively lazy regime with low forgetting to enter a rich regime with significant forgetting. Finally, our findings reveal that neural networks achieve optimal performance at a critical level of feature learning, which depends on task non-stationarity and transfers across model scales. This work provides a unified perspective on the role of scale and feature learning in continual learning.

Abstract: Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN) information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way, and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore provable acceleration of diffusion models without any additional retraining. Focusing on the task of approximating a target data distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation distance, we propose a principled, training-free sampling algorithm that requires only the order of
  $$ d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K} $$
  score function evaluations (up to log factor) in the presence of accurate scores, where $K>0$ is an arbitrary fixed integer. This result applies to a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases -- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed in previous work. The proposed algorithm draws insight from high-order ODE solvers, leveraging high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement to approximate the integral derived from the probability flow ODE. More broadly, our work develops a theoretical framework towards understanding the efficacy of high-order methods for accelerated sampling.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) involves localizing target objects in 3D point clouds based on natural language. While prior work has made strides using textual descriptions, leveraging spoken language-known as Audio-based 3D Visual Grounding-remains underexplored and challenging. Motivated by advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech representation learning, we propose Audio-3DVG, a simple yet effective framework that integrates audio and spatial information for enhanced grounding. Rather than treating speech as a monolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components. First, we introduce (i) Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification task that explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio, enabling more structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an (ii) Audio-Guided Attention module that models the interactions between target candidates and mentioned objects, enhancing discrimination in cluttered 3D environments. To support benchmarking, we (iii) synthesize audio descriptions for standard 3DVG datasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate that Audio-3DVG not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance in audio-based grounding, but also competes with text-based methods, highlight the promise of integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: Quantum computing has opened new opportunities to tackle complex machine learning tasks, for instance, high-dimensional data representations commonly required in intelligent transportation systems. We explore quantum machine learning to model complex skin conductance response (SCR) events that reflect pedestrian stress in a virtual reality road crossing experiment. For this purpose, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with an eight-qubit ZZ feature map and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz and an eight-qubit ZZ feature map, were developed on Pennylane. The dataset consists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude and elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The QSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a low test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the classification model. The QNN model reached a higher test accuracy of 55%, making it a better classification model than the QSVM and the classic versions.

Abstract: Thompson Sampling (TS) is widely used to address the exploration/exploitation tradeoff in contextual bandits, yet recent theory shows that it does not explore aggressively enough in high-dimensional problems. Feel-Good Thompson Sampling (FG-TS) addresses this by adding an optimism bonus that biases toward high-reward models, and it achieves the asymptotically minimax-optimal regret in the linear setting when posteriors are exact. However, its performance with \emph{approximate} posteriors -- common in large-scale or neural problems -- has not been benchmarked. We provide the first systematic study of FG-TS and its smoothed variant (SFG-TS) across eleven real-world and synthetic benchmarks. To evaluate their robustness, we compare performance across settings with exact posteriors (linear and logistic bandits) to approximate regimes produced by fast but coarse stochastic-gradient samplers. Ablations over preconditioning, bonus scale, and prior strength reveal a trade-off: larger bonuses help when posterior samples are accurate, but hurt when sampling noise dominates. FG-TS generally outperforms vanilla TS in linear and logistic bandits, but tends to be weaker in neural bandits. Nevertheless, because FG-TS and its variants are competitive and easy-to-use, we recommend them as baselines in modern contextual-bandit benchmarks. Finally, we provide source code for all our experiments in https://github.com/SarahLiaw/ctx-bandits-mcmc-showdown.

Abstract: While naturalistic driving studies have become foundational for providing real-world driver behaviour data, the existing frameworks for identifying risk based on such data have two fundamental limitations: (i) they rely on predefined time windows and fixed thresholds to disentangle risky and normal episodes of driving behaviour, and (ii) they assume stationary behavioural distribution across drivers and trips. These limitations have hindered the ability of the existing frameworks to capture behavioural nuances, adapt to individual variability, or respond to stochastic fluctuations in driving contexts. Thus, there is a need for a unified framework that jointly adapts risk labels and model learning to per-driver behavioural dynamics, a gap this study aims to bridge. We present an adaptive and personalised risk detection framework, built on Belgian naturalistic driving data, integrating a rolling time window with bi-level optimisation and dynamically calibrating both model hyperparameters and driver-specific risk thresholds at the same time. The framework was tested using two safety indicators, speed-weighted time headway and harsh driving events, and three models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Speed-weighted time headway yielded more stable and context-sensitive classifications than harsh-event counts. XGBoost maintained consistent performance under changing thresholds, while the DNN excelled in early-risk detection at lower thresholds but exhibited higher variability. The ensemble calibration integrates model-specific thresholds and confidence scores into a unified risk decision, balancing sensitivity and stability. Overall, the framework demonstrates the potential of adaptive and personalised risk detection to enhance real-time safety feedback and support driver-specific interventions within intelligent transport systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss. We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.

Abstract: Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

Abstract: Fairness metrics utilizing the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) have gained increasing attention in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. In these domains, fairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a common challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade AUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional Optimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework that strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups using optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable proportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged group. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between reducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore, we extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions to concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic, public, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms existing post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios, often achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive gains in utility.

<title>From Model Performance to Claim: How a Change of Focus in Machine Learning Replicability Can Help Bridge the Responsibility Gap</title>

Abstract: Two goals - improving replicability and accountability of Machine Learning research respectively, have accrued much attention from the AI ethics and the Machine Learning community. Despite sharing the measures of improving transparency, the two goals are discussed in different registers - replicability registers with scientific reasoning whereas accountability registers with ethical reasoning. Given the existing challenge of the Responsibility Gap - holding Machine Learning scientists accountable for Machine Learning harms due to them being far from sites of application, this paper posits that reconceptualizing replicability can help bridge the gap. Through a shift from model performance replicability to claim replicability, Machine Learning scientists can be held accountable for producing non-replicable claims that are prone to eliciting harm due to misuse and misinterpretation. In this paper, I make the following contributions. First, I define and distinguish two forms of replicability for ML research that can aid constructive conversations around replicability. Second, I formulate an argument for claim-replicability's advantage over model performance replicability in justifying assigning accountability to Machine Learning scientists for producing non-replicable claims and show how it enacts a sense of responsibility that is actionable. In addition, I characterize the implementation of claim replicability as more of a social project than a technical one by discussing its competing epistemological principles, practical implications on Circulating Reference, Interpretative Labor, and research communication.

Abstract: Given the rising popularity of AI-generated art and the associated copyright concerns, identifying whether an artwork was used to train a diffusion model is an important research topic. The work approaches this problem from the membership inference attack (MIA) perspective. We first identify the limitation of applying existing MIA methods for proprietary diffusion models: the required access of internal U-nets. To address the above problem, we introduce a novel membership inference attack method that uses only the image-to-image variation API and operates without access to the model's internal U-net. Our method is based on the intuition that the model can more easily obtain an unbiased noise prediction estimate for images from the training set. By applying the API multiple times to the target image, averaging the outputs, and comparing the result to the original image, our approach can classify whether a sample was part of the training set. We validate our method using DDIM and Stable Diffusion setups and further extend both our approach and existing algorithms to the Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our experimental results consistently outperform previous methods.

<title>PrAViC: Probabilistic Adaptation Framework for Real-Time Video Classification</title>

Abstract: Video processing is generally divided into two main categories: processing of the entire video, which typically yields optimal classification outcomes, and real-time processing, where the objective is to make a decision as promptly as possible. Although the models dedicated to the processing of entire videos are typically well-defined and clearly presented in the literature, this is not the case for online processing, where a~plethora of hand-devised methods exist. To address this issue, we present PrAViC, a novel, unified, and theoretically-based adaptation framework for tackling the online classification problem in video data. The initial phase of our study is to establish a mathematical background for the classification of sequential data, with the potential to make a decision at an early stage. This allows us to construct a natural function that encourages the model to return a result much faster. The subsequent phase is to present a straightforward and readily implementable method for adapting offline models to the online setting using recurrent operations. Finally, PrAViC is evaluated by comparing it with existing state-of-the-art offline and online models and datasets. This enables the network to significantly reduce the time required to reach classification decisions while maintaining, or even enhancing, accuracy.

<title>Continuous-time q-Learning for Jump-Diffusion Models under Tsallis Entropy</title>

arXiv:2407.03888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the continuous-time reinforcement learning in jump-diffusion models by featuring the q-learning (the continuous-time counterpart of Q-learning) under Tsallis entropy regularization. Contrary to the Shannon entropy, the general form of Tsallis entropy renders the optimal policy not necessarily a Gibbs measure. Herein, the Lagrange multiplier and KKT condition are needed to ensure that the learned policy is a probability density function. As a consequence, the characterization of the optimal policy using the q-function also involves a Lagrange multiplier. In response, we establish the martingale characterization of the q-function and devise two q-learning algorithms depending on whether the Lagrange multiplier can be derived explicitly or not. In the latter case, we consider different parameterizations of the optimal q-function and the optimal policy, and update them alternatively in an Actor-Critic manner. We also study two numerical examples, namely, an optimal liquidation problem in dark pools and a non-LQ control problem. It is interesting to see therein that the optimal policies under the Tsallis entropy regularization can be characterized explicitly, which are distributions concentrated on some compact support. The satisfactory performance of our q-learning algorithms is illustrated in each example.

Abstract: Language models with billions of parameters exhibit in-context learning abilities, enabling few-shot learning on tasks that the model was not specifically trained for. Traditional models achieve breakthrough performance on language tasks, but do not perform well on basic reasoning benchmarks. However, a new in-context learning approach, Chain-of-thought, has demonstrated strong multi-step reasoning abilities on these benchmarks.
  The research on LLM reasoning abilities started with the question whether LLMs can solve grade school math word problems, and has expanded to other tasks in the past few years. This paper reviews the field of multi-step reasoning with LLMs. We propose a taxonomy that identifies different ways to generate, evaluate, and control multi-step reasoning. We provide an in-depth coverage of core approaches and open problems, and we propose a research agenda for the near future.
  We find that multi-step reasoning approaches have progressed beyond math word problems, and can now successfully solve challenges in logic, combinatorial games, and robotics, sometimes by first generating code that is then executed by external tools. Many studies in multi-step methods are using reinforcement learning for finetuning, external optimization loops, in context reinforcement learning, and self-reflection.

Abstract: In order to sample from an unnormalized probability density function, we propose to combine continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with rejection-resampling steps based on importance weights. We relate the iterative training of CNFs with regularized velocity fields to a JKO scheme and prove convergence of the involved velocity fields to the velocity field of the Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF). The alternation of local flow steps and non-local rejection-resampling steps allows to overcome local minima or slow convergence of the WGF for multimodal distributions. Since the proposal of the rejection step is generated by the model itself, they do not suffer from common drawbacks of classical rejection schemes. The arising model can be trained iteratively, reduces the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) loss function in each step, allows to generate iid samples and moreover allows for evaluations of the generated underlying density. Numerical examples show that our method yields accurate results on various test distributions including high-dimensional multimodal targets and outperforms the state of the art in almost all cases significantly.

Abstract: We present a dynamic hedging scheme for S&amp;P 500 options, where rebalancing decisions are enhanced by integrating information about the implied volatility surface dynamics. The optimal hedging strategy is obtained through a deep policy gradient-type reinforcement learning algorithm. The favorable inclusion of forward-looking information embedded in the volatility surface allows our procedure to outperform several conventional benchmarks such as practitioner and smiled-implied delta hedging procedures, both in simulation and backtesting experiments. The outperformance is more pronounced in the presence of transaction costs.

Abstract: Detecting vulnerabilities is vital for software security, yet deep learning-based vulnerability detectors (DLVD) face a data shortage, which limits their effectiveness. Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.

<title>On the Robustness of Kernel Goodness-of-Fit Tests</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05854</link>

arXiv:2408.05854v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Goodness-of-fit testing is often criticized for its lack of practical relevance: since ``all models are wrong'', the null hypothesis that the data conform to our model is ultimately always rejected as the sample size grows. Despite this, probabilistic models are still used extensively, raising the more pertinent question of whether the model is \emph{good enough} for the task at hand. This question can be formalized as a robust goodness-of-fit testing problem by asking whether the data were generated from a distribution that is a mild perturbation of the model. In this paper, we show that existing kernel goodness-of-fit tests are not robust under common notions of robustness including both qualitative and quantitative robustness. We further show that robustification techniques using tilted kernels, while effective in the parameter estimation literature, are not sufficient to ensure both types of robustness in the testing setting. To address this, we propose the first robust kernel goodness-of-fit test, which resolves this open problem by using kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD) balls. This framework encompasses many well-known perturbation models, such as Huber's contamination and density-band models.

Abstract: Training a neural network is a monolithic endeavor, akin to carving knowledge into stone: once the process is completed, editing the knowledge in a network is hard, since all information is distributed across the network's weights. We here explore a simple, compelling alternative by marrying the representational power of deep neural networks with the flexibility of a database. Decomposing the task of image classification into image similarity (from a pre-trained embedding) and search (via fast nearest neighbor retrieval from a knowledge database), we build on well-established components to construct a simple and flexible visual memory that has the following key capabilities: (1.) The ability to flexibly add data across scales: from individual samples all the way to entire classes and billion-scale data; (2.) The ability to remove data through unlearning and memory pruning; (3.) An interpretable decision-mechanism on which we can intervene to control its behavior. Taken together, these capabilities comprehensively demonstrate the benefits of an explicit visual memory. We hope that it might contribute to a conversation on how knowledge should be represented in deep vision models -- beyond carving it in "stone" weights.

Abstract: Neural networks have continued to gain prevalence in the modern era for their ability to model complex data through pattern recognition and behavior remodeling. However, the static construction of traditional neural networks inhibits dynamic intelligence. This makes them inflexible to temporal changes in data and unfit to capture complex dependencies. With the advent of quantum technology, there has been significant progress in creating quantum algorithms. In recent years, researchers have developed quantum neural networks that leverage the capabilities of qubits to outperform classical networks. However, their current formulation exhibits a static construction limiting the system's dynamic intelligence. To address these weaknesses, we develop a Liquid Quantum Neural Network (LQNet) and a Continuous Time Recurrent Quantum Neural Network (CTRQNet). Both models demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy compared to existing quantum neural networks (QNNs), achieving accuracy increases as high as 40\% on CIFAR 10 through binary classification. We propose LQNets and CTRQNets might shine a light on quantum machine learning's black box.

Abstract: The combination of machine learning (ML) and sparsity-promoting techniques is enabling direct extraction of governing equations from data, revolutionizing computational modeling in diverse fields of science and engineering. The discovered dynamical models could be used to address challenges in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, epidemiology, and beyond. However, most existing sparse identification methods for discovering dynamical systems treat the whole system as one without considering the interactions between subsystems. As a result, such models are not able to capture small changes in the emergent system behavior. To address this issue, we developed a new method called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-structured data (SINDyG), which incorporates the network structure into sparse regression to identify model parameters that explain the underlying network dynamics. We tested our proposed method using several case studies of neuronal dynamics, where we modeled the macroscopic oscillation of a population of neurons using the extended Stuart-Landau (SL) equation and utilize the SINDyG method to identify the underlying nonlinear dynamics. Our extensive computational experiments validate the improved accuracy and simplicity of discovered network dynamics when compared to the original SINDy approach. The proposed graph-informed penalty can be easily integrated with other symbolic regression algorithms, enhancing model interpretability and performance by incorporating network structure into the regression process.

Abstract: Modern code review is a ubiquitous software quality assurance process aimed at identifying potential issues within newly written code. Despite its effectiveness, the process demands large amounts of effort from the human reviewers involved. To help alleviate this workload, researchers have trained deep learning models to imitate human reviewers in providing natural language code reviews. Formally, this task is known as code review comment generation. Prior work has demonstrated improvements in this task by leveraging machine learning techniques and neural models, such as transfer learning and the transformer architecture. However, the quality of the model generated reviews remain sub-optimal due to the quality of the open-source code review data used in model training. This is in part due to the data obtained from open-source projects where code reviews are conducted in a public forum, and reviewers possess varying levels of software development experience, potentially affecting the quality of their feedback. To accommodate for this variation, we propose a suite of experience-aware training methods that utilise the reviewers' past authoring and reviewing experiences as signals for review quality. Specifically, we propose experience-aware loss functions (ELF), which use the reviewers' authoring and reviewing ownership of a project as weights in the model's loss function. Through this method, experienced reviewers' code reviews yield larger influence over the model's behaviour. Compared to the SOTA model, ELF was able to generate higher quality reviews in terms of accuracy, informativeness, and comment types generated. The key contribution of this work is the demonstration of how traditional software engineering concepts such as reviewer experience can be integrated into the design of AI-based automated code review models.

<title>A spectral method for multi-view subspace learning using the product of projections</title>

arXiv:2410.19125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-view data provides complementary information on the same set of observations, with multi-omics and multimodal sensor data being common examples. Analyzing such data typically requires distinguishing between shared (joint) and unique (individual) signal subspaces from noisy, high-dimensional measurements. Despite many proposed methods, the conditions for reliably identifying joint and individual subspaces remain unclear. We rigorously quantify these conditions, which depend on the ratio of the signal rank to the ambient dimension, principal angles between true subspaces, and noise levels. Our approach characterizes how spectrum perturbations of the product of projection matrices, derived from each view's estimated subspaces, affect subspace separation. Using these insights, we provide an easy-to-use and scalable estimation algorithm. In particular, we employ rotational bootstrap and random matrix theory to partition the observed spectrum into joint, individual, and noise subspaces. Diagnostic plots visualize this partitioning, providing practical and interpretable insights into the estimation performance. In simulations, our method estimates joint and individual subspaces more accurately than existing approaches. Applications to multi-omics data from colorectal cancer patients and nutrigenomic study of mice demonstrate improved performance in downstream predictive tasks.

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, which can be further augmented by integrating a pre-trained vision model into the original LLM to create a multimodal LLM (MLLM). However, this integration often significantly decreases performance on natural language understanding and generation tasks, compared to the original LLM. This study investigates this issue using the LLaVA MLLM, treating the integration as a continual learning problem. We evaluate five continual learning methods to mitigate forgetting and identify a technique that enhances visual understanding while minimizing linguistic performance loss. Our approach reduces linguistic performance degradation by up to 15% over the LLaVA recipe, while maintaining high multimodal accuracy. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method through continual learning on a sequence of vision-language tasks, effectively preserving linguistic skills while acquiring new multimodal capabilities.

arXiv:2412.03012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the whole-body loco-manipulation problem using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we focus on the problem of how to coordinate the floating base and the robotic arm of a wheeled-quadrupedal manipulator robot to achieve direct six-dimensional (6D) end-effector (EE) pose tracking in task space. Different from conventional whole-body loco-manipulation problems that track both floating-base and end-effector commands, the direct EE pose tracking problem requires inherent balance among redundant degrees of freedom in the whole-body motion. We leverage RL to solve this challenging problem. To address the associated difficulties, we develop a novel reward fusion module (RFM) that systematically integrates reward terms corresponding to different tasks in a nonlinear manner. In such a way, the inherent multi-stage and hierarchical feature of the loco-manipulation problem can be carefully accommodated. By combining the proposed RFM with the a teacher-student RL training paradigm, we present a complete RL scheme to achieve 6D EE pose tracking for the wheeled-quadruped manipulator robot. Extensive simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate the significance of the RFM. In particular, we enable smooth and precise tracking performance, achieving state-of-the-art tracking position error of less than 5 cm, and rotation error of less than 0.1 rad.

Abstract: From a simple text prompt, generative-AI image models can create stunningly realistic and creative images bounded, it seems, by only our imagination. These models have achieved this remarkable feat thanks, in part, to the ingestion of billions of images collected from nearly every corner of the internet. Many creators have understandably expressed concern over how their intellectual property has been ingested without their permission or a mechanism to opt out of training. As a result, questions of fair use and copyright infringement have quickly emerged. We describe a method that allows us to determine if a model was trained on a specific image or set of images. This method is computationally efficient and assumes no explicit knowledge of the model architecture or weights (so-called black-box membership inference). We anticipate that this method will be crucial for auditing existing models and, looking ahead, ensuring the fairer development and deployment of generative AI models.

Abstract: Real-world audio is often degraded by numerous factors. This work presents an audio restoration model tailored for high-res music at 44.1kHz. Our model, Audio-to-Audio Schr\"odinger Bridges (A2SB), is capable of both bandwidth extension (predicting high-frequency components) and inpainting (re-generating missing segments). Critically, A2SB is end-to-end requiring no vocoder to predict waveform outputs, able to restore hour-long audio inputs, and trained on permissively licensed music data. A2SB is capable of achieving state-of-the-art band-width extension and inpainting quality on several out-of-distribution music test sets.

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models rely critically on the KV cache to efficiently handle extended contexts during the decode phase. Yet, the size of the KV cache grows proportionally with the input length, burdening both memory bandwidth and capacity as decoding progresses. To address this challenge, we present RocketKV, a training-free KV cache compression strategy containing two consecutive stages. In the first stage, it performs coarse-grain permanent KV cache eviction on the input sequence tokens. In the second stage, it adopts a hybrid sparse attention method to conduct fine-grain top-k sparse attention, approximating the attention scores by leveraging both head and sequence dimensionality reductions. We show that RocketKV provides a compression ratio of up to 400$\times$, end-to-end speedup of up to 3.7$\times$ as well as peak memory reduction of up to 32.6% in the decode phase on an NVIDIA A100 GPU compared to the full KV cache baseline, while achieving negligible accuracy loss on a variety of long-context tasks. We also propose a variant of RocketKV for multi-turn scenarios, which consistently outperforms other existing methods and achieves accuracy nearly on par with an oracle top-k attention scheme.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the verification of quantized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where some fixed-width arithmetic is used to represent numbers. We introduce the linear-constrained validity (LVP) problem for verifying GNNs properties, and provide an efficient translation from LVP instances into a logical language. We show that LVP is in PSPACE, for any reasonable activation functions. We provide a proof system. We also prove PSPACE-hardness, indicating that while reasoning about quantized GNNs is feasible, it remains generally computationally challenging.

<title>Generative Active Adaptation for Drifting and Imbalanced Network Intrusion Detection</title>

Abstract: Machine learning has shown promise in network intrusion detection systems, yet its performance often degrades due to concept drift and imbalanced data. These challenges are compounded by the labor-intensive process of labeling network traffic, especially when dealing with evolving and rare attack types, which makes preparing the right data for adaptation difficult. To address these issues, we propose a generative active adaptation framework that minimizes labeling effort while enhancing model robustness. Our approach employs density-aware dataset prior selection to identify the most informative samples for annotation, and leverages deep generative models to conditionally synthesize diverse samples, thereby augmenting the training set and mitigating the effects of concept drift. We evaluate our end-to-end framework \NetGuard on both simulated IDS data and a real-world ISP dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in intrusion detection performance. Our method boosts the overall F1-score from 0.60 (without adaptation) to 0.86. Rare attacks such as Infiltration, Web Attack, and FTP-BruteForce, which originally achieved F1 scores of 0.001, 0.04, and 0.00, improve to 0.30, 0.50, and 0.71, respectively, with generative active adaptation in the CIC-IDS 2018 dataset. Our framework effectively enhances rare attack detection while reducing labeling costs, making it a scalable and practical solution for intrusion detection.

Abstract: Understanding and replicating the real world is a critical challenge in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research. To achieve this, many existing approaches, such as world models, aim to capture the fundamental principles governing the physical world, enabling more accurate simulations and meaningful interactions. However, current methods often treat different modalities, including 2D (images), videos, 3D, and 4D representations, as independent domains, overlooking their interdependencies. Additionally, these methods typically focus on isolated dimensions of reality without systematically integrating their connections. In this survey, we present a unified survey for multimodal generative models that investigate the progression of data dimensionality in real-world simulation. Specifically, this survey starts from 2D generation (appearance), then moves to video (appearance+dynamics) and 3D generation (appearance+geometry), and finally culminates in 4D generation that integrate all dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically unify the study of 2D, video, 3D and 4D generation within a single framework. To guide future research, we provide a comprehensive review of datasets, evaluation metrics and future directions, and fostering insights for newcomers. This survey serves as a bridge to advance the study of multimodal generative models and real-world simulation within a unified framework.

<title>FT-Transformer: Resilient and Reliable Transformer with End-to-End Fault Tolerant Attention</title>

Abstract: Transformer models rely on High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources for inference, where soft errors are inevitable in large-scale systems, making the reliability of the model particularly critical. Existing fault tolerance frameworks for Transformers are designed at the operation level without architectural optimization, leading to significant computational and memory overhead, which in turn reduces protection efficiency and limits scalability to larger models. In this paper, we implement module-level protection for Transformers by treating the operations within the attention module as a single kernel and applying end-to-end fault tolerance. This method provides unified protection across multi-step computations, while achieving comprehensive coverage of potential errors in the nonlinear computations. For linear modules, we design a strided algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) that avoids inter-thread communication. Experimental results show that our end-to-end fault tolerance achieves up to 7.56x speedup over traditional methods with an average fault tolerance overhead of 13.9%.

Abstract: AI-generated text is proliferating across domains, from creative writing and journalism to marketing content and scientific articles. Models can follow user-provided instructions to generate coherent and grammatically correct outputs but in this work, we study a more fundamental question: how do we evaluate and improve the writing quality of AI-generated text? Writing quality assessment has received less attention from the community, in part because it is fundamentally subjective and requires expertise. We first introduce the Writing Quality Benchmark (WQ) by consolidating five writing-preference datasets into 4,729 writing quality judgments. Our experiments show that most of the competitive baselines, including state-of-the-art LLMs that excel at reasoning tasks, barely outperform random baselines on WQ. We then train specialized Writing Quality Reward Models (WQRM) of various sizes for writing quality assessment that demonstrate strong generalization on four out-of-distribution test sets and 74% accuracy on the WQ benchmark. To further show WQRM's practical benefits during inference, we leverage additional test-time compute to generate and rank multiple candidate revisions, allowing us to select higher-quality outputs from an initial draft. Human evaluation with 9 experienced writers confirm that WQRM-based selection produces writing samples preferred by experts 66% overall, and 72.2% when the reward gap is larger than 1 point. We release our datasets and models to encourage community engagement with writing quality assessment and development of AI writing systems better aligned with human preferences.

Abstract: Electronic health record (EHR) foundation models have been an area ripe for exploration with their improved performance in various medical tasks. Despite the rapid advances, there exists a fundamental limitation: Processing unseen medical codes out of the vocabulary. This problem limits the generality of EHR foundation models and the integration of models trained with different vocabularies. To deal with this problem, we propose MedRep for EHR foundation models based on the observational medical outcome partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM), providing the integrated medical concept representations and the basic data augmentation strategy for patient trajectories. For concept representation learning, we enrich the information of each concept with a minimal definition through large language model (LLM) prompts and enhance the text-based representations through graph ontology of OMOP vocabulary. Trajectory augmentation randomly replaces selected concepts with other similar concepts that have closely related representations to let the model practice with the concepts out-of-vocabulary. Finally, we demonstrate that EHR foundation models trained with MedRep better maintain the prediction performance in external datasets. Our code implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/kicarussays/MedRep.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for cryo-electron microscopy, employing neural networks in methods like CryoSBI to infer biomolecular conformations via learned latent representations. This latent space represents a rich opportunity, encoding valuable information about the physical system and the inference process. Harnessing this potential hinges on understanding the underlying geometric structure of these representations. We investigate this structure by applying manifold learning techniques to CryoSBI representations of hemagglutinin (simulated and experimental). We reveal that these high-dimensional data inherently populate low-dimensional, smooth manifolds, with simulated data effectively covering the experimental counterpart. By characterizing the manifold's geometry using Diffusion Maps and identifying its principal axes of variation via coordinate interpretation methods, we establish a direct link between the latent structure and key physical parameters. Discovering this intrinsic low-dimensionality and interpretable geometric organization not only validates the CryoSBI approach but enables us to learn more from the data structure and provides opportunities for improving future inference strategies by exploiting this revealed manifold geometry.

Abstract: Automated parking is a critical feature of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), where accurate trajectory prediction is essential to bridge perception and planning modules. Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.

<title>Towards Safer Pretraining: Analyzing and Filtering Harmful Content in Webscale datasets for Responsible LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to various real-world applications, leveraging massive, web-sourced datasets like Common Crawl, C4, and FineWeb for pretraining. While these datasets provide linguistic data essential for high-quality natural language generation, they often contain harmful content, such as hate speech, misinformation, and biased narratives. Training LLMs on such unfiltered data risks perpetuating toxic behaviors, spreading misinformation, and amplifying societal biases which can undermine trust in LLM-driven applications and raise ethical concerns about their use. This paper presents a large-scale analysis of inappropriate content across these datasets, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes harmful webpages into Topical and Toxic based on their intent. We also introduce a prompt evaluation dataset, a high-accuracy Topical and Toxic Prompt (TTP), and a transformer-based model (HarmFormer) for harmful content filtering. Additionally, we create a new multi-harm open-ended toxicity benchmark (HAVOC) and provide crucial insights into how models respond to adversarial toxic inputs. We share TTP, TTP-Eval, HAVOC and a sample of C4 inferenced on HarmFormer. Our work offers insights into ensuring safer LLM pretraining and serves as a resource for Responsible AI (RAI) compliance.

Abstract: Trajectory optimization is a cornerstone of modern robot autonomy, enabling systems to compute trajectories and controls in real-time while respecting safety and physical constraints. However, it has seen limited usage in spaceflight applications due to its heavy computational demands that exceed the capability of most flight computers. In this work, we provide results on the first flight demonstration of using machine learning-based warm starts for accelerating trajectory optimization for the Astrobee free-flying robot on-board the International Space Station (ISS). We formulate a data-driven optimal control approach that trains a neural network to learn the structure of the trajectory generation problem being solved for by sequential convex programming (SCP). On-board, this trained neural network predicts solutions for the trajectory generation problem and relies on using the SCP solver to enforce safety constraints for the system. Our trained network reduces the number of solver iterations required for convergence in cases including rotational dynamics by 60% and in cases with obstacles drawn from the training distribution of the warm start model by 50%. This work represents a significant milestone in the use of learning-based control for spaceflight applications and a stepping stone for future advances in the use of machine learning for autonomous guidance, navigation, & control.

Abstract: We propose a novel method, termed the M-learner, for estimating heterogeneous indirect and total treatment effects and identifying relevant subgroups within a mediation framework. The procedure comprises four key steps. First, we compute individual-level conditional average indirect/total treatment effect Second, we construct a distance matrix based on pairwise differences. Third, we apply tSNE to project this matrix into a low-dimensional Euclidean space, followed by K-means clustering to identify subgroup structures. Finally, we calibrate and refine the clusters using a threshold-based procedure to determine the optimal configuration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach specifically designed to capture treatment effect heterogeneity in the presence of mediation. Experimental results validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed framework. Application to the real-world Jobs II dataset highlights the broad adaptability and potential applicability of our method.Code is available at https: //anonymous.4open.science/r/M-learner-C4BB.

Abstract: The emergence of scaling laws has profoundly shaped the development of large language models (LLMs), enabling predictable performance gains through systematic increases in model size, dataset volume, and compute. Yet, these principles remain largely unexplored in the context of electronic health records (EHRs) -- a rich, sequential, and globally abundant data source that differs structurally from natural language. In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of scaling laws for EHR foundation models. By training transformer architectures on patient timeline data from the MIMIC-IV database across varying model sizes and compute budgets, we identify consistent scaling patterns, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility. These findings demonstrate that EHR models exhibit scaling behavior analogous to LLMs, offering predictive insights into resource-efficient training strategies. Our results lay the groundwork for developing powerful EHR foundation models capable of transforming clinical prediction tasks and advancing personalized healthcare.

arXiv:2506.02260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of digital health technologies has led to the generation of complex multi-modal data, such as physical activity measurements simultaneously collected from various sensors of mobile and wearable devices. These data hold immense potential for advancing health studies, but current methods predominantly rely on supervised learning, requiring extensive labeled datasets that are often expensive or impractical to obtain, especially in clinical studies. To address this limitation, we propose a self-supervised learning framework called Multi-modal Cross-masked Autoencoder (MoCA) that leverages cross-modality masking and the Transformer autoencoder architecture to utilize both temporal correlations within modalities and cross-modal correlations between data streams. We also provide theoretical guarantees to support the effectiveness of the cross-modality masking scheme in MoCA. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both reconstruction and downstream tasks. We release open-source code for data processing, pre-training, and downstream tasks in the supplementary materials. This work highlights the transformative potential of self-supervised learning in digital health and multi-modal data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review. However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Internet services, recommendation systems play a central role in delivering personalized content. Faced with massive user requests and complex model architectures, the key challenge for real-time recommendation systems is how to reduce inference latency and increase system throughput without sacrificing recommendation quality. This paper addresses the high computational cost and resource bottlenecks of deep learning models in real-time settings by proposing a combined set of modeling- and system-level acceleration and optimization strategies. At the model level, we dramatically reduce parameter counts and compute requirements through lightweight network design, structured pruning, and weight quantization. At the system level, we integrate multiple heterogeneous compute platforms and high-performance inference libraries, and we design elastic inference scheduling and load-balancing mechanisms based on real-time load characteristics. Experiments show that, while maintaining the original recommendation accuracy, our methods cut latency to less than 30% of the baseline and more than double system throughput, offering a practical solution for deploying large-scale online recommendation services.

<title>MGDFIS: Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy for Small Object Detection</title>

arXiv:2506.12697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small object detection in UAV imagery is crucial for applications such as search-and-rescue, traffic monitoring, and environmental surveillance, but it is hampered by tiny object size, low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited feature extraction. Existing multi-scale fusion methods help, but add computational burden and blur fine details, making small object detection in cluttered scenes difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified fusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost detection performance while maintaining efficiency. MGDFIS comprises three synergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries token-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight spectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration Module, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and parallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and the Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps to rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen responses to true object regions. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone benchmark demonstrate that MGDFIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse backbone architectures and detection frameworks, achieving superior precision and recall with low inference time. By striking an optimal balance between accuracy and resource usage, MGDFIS provides a practical solution for small-object detection on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

arXiv:2506.13265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter previously unseen object classes. However, most existing LiDAR panoptic segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale. Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level. To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR panoptic segmentation methods.

arXiv:2506.17857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) binding affinity is essential for therapeutic design and vaccine development, yet the performance of current models is limited by noisy experimental labels, heterogeneous assay conditions, and poor generalization across the vast antibody and antigen sequence space. We introduce AbRank, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework that reframes affinity prediction as a pairwise ranking problem. AbRank aggregates over 380,000 binding assays from nine heterogeneous sources, spanning diverse antibodies, antigens, and experimental conditions, and introduces standardized data splits that systematically increase distribution shift, from local perturbations such as point mutations to broad generalization across novel antigens and antibodies. To ensure robust supervision, AbRank defines an m-confident ranking framework by filtering out comparisons with marginal affinity differences, focusing training on pairs with at least an m-fold difference in measured binding strength. As a baseline for the benchmark, we introduce WALLE-Affinity, a graph-based approach that integrates protein language model embeddings with structural information to predict pairwise binding preferences. Our benchmarks reveal significant limitations in current methods under realistic generalization settings and demonstrate that ranking-based training improves robustness and transferability. In summary, AbRank offers a robust foundation for machine learning models to generalize across the antibody-antigen space, with direct relevance for scalable, structure-aware antibody therapeutic design.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face growing vulnerability to sophisticated jailbreak attacks. While developers invest heavily in alignment finetuning and safety guardrails, researchers continue publishing novel attacks, driving progress through adversarial iteration. This dynamic mirrors a strategic game of continual evolution. However, two major challenges hinder jailbreak development: the high cost of querying top-tier LLMs and the short lifespan of effective attacks due to frequent safety updates. These factors limit cost-efficiency and practical impact of research in jailbreak attacks. To address this, we propose MetaCipher, a low-cost, multi-agent jailbreak framework that generalizes across LLMs with varying safety measures. Using reinforcement learning, MetaCipher is modular and adaptive, supporting extensibility to future strategies. Within as few as 10 queries, MetaCipher achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on recent malicious prompt benchmarks, outperforming prior jailbreak methods. We conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation across diverse victim models and benchmarks, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability. Warning: This paper contains model outputs that may be offensive or harmful, shown solely to demonstrate jailbreak efficacy.

Abstract: We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking and GLM-4.5V, a family of vision-language models (VLMs) designed to advance general-purpose multimodal understanding and reasoning. In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document interpretation. In a comprehensive evaluation across 42 public benchmarks, GLM-4.5V achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks among open-source models of similar size, and demonstrates competitive or even superior results compared to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on challenging tasks including Coding and GUI Agents. Meanwhile, the smaller GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking remains highly competitive-achieving superior results to the much larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B on 29 benchmarks. We open-source both GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and GLM-4.5V. Code, models and more information are released at https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-V.

Abstract: To meet the growing demand for smarter, faster, and more efficient embodied AI solutions, we introduce a novel Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) method that significantly boosts reasoning and learning efficiency for embodied autonomous systems. General MoE models demand extensive training data and complex optimization, which limits their applicability in embodied AI such as autonomous driving (AD) and robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose a skill-oriented MoE called MoSE, which mimics the human learning and reasoning process skill-by-skill, step-by-step. We introduce a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. To better align with multi-step planning in human reasoning and in end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike other multi-round dialogues, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g. perception-prediction-planning for AD, and high-level and low-level planning for robots) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model effectively grows more diverse expertise and outperforms models on both AD corner-case reasoning tasks and robot reasoning tasks with less than 40% of the parameters.

<title>Efficient Visual Appearance Optimization by Learning from Prior Preferences</title>

Abstract: Adjusting visual parameters such as brightness and contrast is common in our everyday experiences. Finding the optimal parameter setting is challenging due to the large search space and the lack of an explicit objective function, leaving users to rely solely on their implicit preferences. Prior work has explored Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO) to address this challenge, involving users to iteratively select preferred designs from candidate sets. However, PBO often requires many rounds of preference comparisons, making it more suitable for designers than everyday end-users. We propose Meta-PO, a novel method that integrates PBO with meta-learning to improve sample efficiency. Specifically, Meta-PO infers prior users' preferences and stores them as models, which are leveraged to intelligently suggest design candidates for the new users, enabling faster convergence and more personalized results. An experimental evaluation of our method for appearance design tasks on 2D and 3D content showed that participants achieved satisfactory appearance in 5.86 iterations using Meta-PO when participants shared similar goals with a population (e.g., tuning for a ``warm'' look) and in 8 iterations even generalizes across divergent goals (e.g., from ``vintage'', ``warm'', to ``holiday''). Meta-PO makes personalized visual optimization more applicable to end-users through a generalizable, more efficient optimization conditioned on preferences, with the potential to scale interface personalization more broadly.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV (Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization capabilities.

<title>Nonconvex Optimization Framework for Group-Sparse Feedback Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control: Non-Penalty Approach</title>

Abstract: In [1], the distributed linear-quadratic problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the sparse feedback LQ problem (SF-LQ) are formulated into a nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem with affine constraints. Moreover, a penalty approach is considered in [1], and the PALM (proximal alternating linearized minimization) algorithm is studied with convergence and complexity analysis. In this paper, we aim to address the inherent drawbacks of the penalty approach, such as the challenge of tuning the penalty parameter and the risk of introducing spurious stationary points. Specifically, we first reformulate the SF-LQ problem and the DFT-LQ problem from an epi-composition function perspective, aiming to solve constrained problem directly. Then, from a theoretical viewpoint, we revisit the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and establish its convergence to the set of cluster points under certain assumptions. When these assumptions do not hold, we show that alternative approaches combining subgradient descent with Difference-of-Convex relaxation methods can be effectively utilized. In summary, our results enable the direct design of group-sparse feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex surrogates, restrictive structural assumptions or penalty formulations that incorporate constraints into the cost function.

Abstract: Recommendation systems often suffer from data sparsity caused by limited user-item interactions, which degrade their performance and amplify popularity bias in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel data augmentation framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and item textual descriptions to enrich interaction data. By few-shot prompting LLMs multiple times to rerank items and aggregating the results via majority voting, we generate high-confidence synthetic user-item interactions, supported by theoretical guarantees based on the concentration of measure. To effectively leverage the augmented data in the context of a graph recommendation system, we integrate it into a graph contrastive learning framework to mitigate distributional shift and alleviate popularity bias. Extensive experiments show that our method improves accuracy and reduces popularity bias, outperforming strong baselines.

<title>Representation biases: will we achieve complete understanding by analyzing representations?</title>

Abstract: A common approach in neuroscience is to study neural representations as a means to understand a system -- increasingly, by relating the neural representations to the internal representations learned by computational models. However, a recent work in machine learning (Lampinen, 2024) shows that learned feature representations may be biased to over-represent certain features, and represent others more weakly and less-consistently. For example, simple (linear) features may be more strongly and more consistently represented than complex (highly nonlinear) features. These biases could pose challenges for achieving full understanding of a system through representational analysis. In this perspective, we illustrate these challenges -- showing how feature representation biases can lead to strongly biased inferences from common analyses like PCA, regression, and RSA. We also present homomorphic encryption as a simple case study of the potential for strong dissociation between patterns of representation and computation. We discuss the implications of these results for representational comparisons between systems, and for neuroscience more generally.

<title>Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage? A Data Distribution Lens</title>

arXiv:2508.01191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents (CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software, particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge, we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software. Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks. The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

<div> land patents, large language models, georeferencing, Virginia, historical

Summary:
Large language models were evaluated for converting historical land patent descriptions into geographically accurate coordinates in Virginia. A corpus of 5,471 patent abstracts from 1695-1732 was analyzed, with a benchmark of 43 test cases. The top-performing LLM achieved a mean error of 23 km, outperforming other LLMs and external baselines. A five-call ensemble reduced errors further to 19 km at low cost. Redacting patentee names increased errors, indicating reliance on textual descriptions. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained a 28 km error with a strong cost-accuracy benchmark. External geocoding tools did not offer significant benefits. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and cost-effective historical georeferencing.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs) in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43 rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class, and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3, and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km (median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70% (Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12 km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Summary:<br />
Hat-DFed is a novel framework for Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) in Edge Computing (EC) systems. It addresses challenges related to dynamic topology changes, resource heterogeneity, and data heterogeneity in the learning process. The framework formulates topology construction as a dual optimization problem to maximize model performance and minimize energy consumption. A two-phase algorithm is designed to construct optimal communication topologies and estimate their impact on performance and energy cost. Additionally, an importance-aware model aggregation mechanism is integrated to mitigate the effects of data heterogeneity on model performance. Hat-DFed aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of DFL in complex edge environments, providing a comprehensive solution for collaborative training of AI models while ensuring data privacy and minimizing communication bottlenecks. <div>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers, decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, has been extensively explored in the research community. Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions. Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring, yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity, nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for spatially distributed time series prediction.

Summary:<br />
Deep learning has shown immense potential in various fields, but suffers from performance degradation when faced with domain shifts. The proposed MoSSDA framework tackles this issue in multivariate time-series classification by incorporating a two-step momentum encoder-utilized approach. This framework utilizes a domain-invariant encoder to extract features from both the source and target domains, followed by a positive contrastive module powered by an online momentum encoder. By leveraging the learned features without data augmentation, MoSSDA achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse datasets with different backbones and various unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The efficacy of each module, including two-stage learning, has been validated through an ablation study. The MoSSDA code is available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.08280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields; however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue, assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework, MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust, domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains. Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

<div> Keywords: telecom data, cellular traffic prediction, Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal feature Complementarity, concept drift, online learning <br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a new method, Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal feature Complementarity (MGSTC), to improve cellular traffic prediction in the telecom industry. It addresses the challenges of sporadic and bursty traffic patterns by segmenting data into chunks and utilizing coarse-grained temporal attention for trend reference and fine-grained spatial attention for detailed correlations. This approach leverages the complementarity of multi-grained spatial-temporal features to enhance prediction accuracy. Furthermore, an online learning strategy is implemented to detect concept drift in real-time and adjust parameters accordingly. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of MGSTC over eleven state-of-the-art baselines consistently.്<br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation. Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios. Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

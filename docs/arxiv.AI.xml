<div> Keywords: memes, harmful messages, multimodal system, detection, BLIP-2

<br><br>Summary: This paper introduces MemeBLIP2, a lightweight multimodal system designed to detect harmful memes that often combine visuals with short text for humor or opinion sharing. Recognizing that some memes can carry destructive messages such as hate speech, the authors aim to improve identification techniques by integrating both image and text features effectively. The system builds on previous research by incorporating additional modules that align image and text representations in a shared space, facilitating better classification. Using BLIP-2, a core vision-language model, MemeBLIP2 is evaluated using the PrideMM dataset, specifically designed for this purpose. The results demonstrate that MemeBLIP2 excels at capturing subtle cues in both visual and textual modalities, enhancing its ability to discern harmful content even when it involves ironic or culturally specific references. Overall, the study highlights the importance of leveraging multimodal approaches in meme analysis, contributing to the advancement of systems that can better identify and mitigate the spread of harmful messages in digital spaces. <div>

Abstract: Memes often merge visuals with brief text to share humor or opinions, yet some memes contain harmful messages such as hate speech. In this paper, we introduces MemeBLIP2, a light weight multimodal system that detects harmful memes by combining image and text features effectively. We build on previous studies by adding modules that align image and text representations into a shared space and fuse them for better classification. Using BLIP-2 as the core vision-language model, our system is evaluated on the PrideMM datasets. The results show that MemeBLIP2 can capture subtle cues in both modalities, even in cases with ironic or culturally specific content, thereby improving the detection of harmful material.

<div> metric learning, goal recognition, deep learning, Siamese network, RNN

Summary:
GRAML (Goal Recognition As Metric Learning) is a new approach to goal recognition that uses a Siamese network and RNN to learn a metric over an embedding space. This enables quick adaptation to new goals by ensuring that embeddings of observation traces leading to different goals are distant, while embeddings of traces leading to the same goals are close. GRAML outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of speed, flexibility, and runtime efficiency while maintaining high accuracy in goal recognition. By treating goal recognition as a deep metric learning task, GRAML eliminates the need for manual domain models and reduces the time required for training on new goals. This approach is particularly effective in scenarios where only one example observation trace per goal is available, making it a valuable tool for automated and adaptive goal recognition in various environments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Goal Recognition (GR) is the problem of recognizing an agent's objectives based on observed actions. Recent data-driven approaches for GR alleviate the need for costly, manually crafted domain models. However, these approaches can only reason about a pre-defined set of goals, and time-consuming training is needed for new emerging goals. To keep this model-learning automated while enabling quick adaptation to new goals, this paper introduces GRAML: Goal Recognition As Metric Learning. GRAML uses a Siamese network to treat GR as a deep metric learning task, employing an RNN that learns a metric over an embedding space, where the embeddings for observation traces leading to different goals are distant, and embeddings of traces leading to the same goals are close. This metric is especially useful when adapting to new goals, even if given just one example observation trace per goal. Evaluated on a versatile set of environments, GRAML shows speed, flexibility, and runtime improvements over the state-of-the-art GR while maintaining accurate recognition.

Summary: 
In this work, the researchers focus on developing general-purpose agents in reinforcement learning that can quickly adapt to new tasks. They demonstrate that using the latest reasoning LLMs with out-of-domain RL post-training, their agents can successfully play the challenging Atari game Frogger without prior training on the specific game. The study also examines the impact of in-context learning and the level of reasoning effort on the performance of the LLMs. Additionally, the researchers introduce a method to enhance traditional RL algorithms by incorporating demonstrations from the LLMs, resulting in improved performance and increased sample efficiency. The implementation of their approach is available as open source code on GitHub at https://github.com/AlienKevin/frogger. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: One of the primary aspirations in reinforcement learning research is developing general-purpose agents capable of rapidly adapting to and mastering novel tasks. While RL gaming agents have mastered many Atari games, they remain slow and costly to train for each game. In this work, we demonstrate that latest reasoning LLMs with out-of-domain RL post-training can play a challenging Atari game called Frogger under a zero-shot setting. We then investigate the effect of in-context learning and the amount of reasoning effort on LLM performance. Lastly, we demonstrate a way to bootstrap traditional RL method with LLM demonstrations, which significantly improves their performance and sample efficiency. Our implementation is open sourced at https://github.com/AlienKevin/frogger.

<div> Cooperation, narratives, LLM agents, negotiation, public goods game <br />
<br />
Narratives play a crucial role in motivating large-scale human cooperation, as observed by Yuval Noah Harari. This study investigates whether narratives can also influence the collaboration of LLM agents. Through experiments involving a public goods game with repeated interactions, agents were primed with different stories emphasizing either teamwork or self-interest. The study found that narratives significantly impact negotiation behavior, with shared stories leading to improved collaboration among agents. However, when agents were primed with conflicting narratives, those inclined towards self-interest outperformed their cooperative counterparts. The number of agents involved in the negotiation also influenced the outcomes, with larger groups exhibiting varying levels of cooperation based on priming. These findings suggest that narrative priming can shape the behavior of artificial agents in multi-agent systems, highlighting the importance of aligning AI with cooperative values.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Yuval Noah Harari, large-scale human cooperation is driven by shared narratives that encode common beliefs and values. This study explores whether such narratives can similarly nudge LLM agents toward collaboration. We use a finitely repeated public goods game in which LLM agents choose either cooperative or egoistic spending strategies. We prime agents with stories highlighting teamwork to different degrees and test how this influences negotiation outcomes. Our experiments explore four questions:(1) How do narratives influence negotiation behavior? (2) What differs when agents share the same story versus different ones? (3) What happens when the agent numbers grow? (4) Are agents resilient against self-serving negotiators? We find that story-based priming significantly affects negotiation strategies and success rates. Common stories improve collaboration, benefiting each agent. By contrast, priming agents with different stories reverses this effect, and those agents primed toward self-interest prevail. We hypothesize that these results carry implications for multi-agent system design and AI alignment.

Abstract: Emergency response services are critical to public safety, with 9-1-1 call-takers playing a key role in ensuring timely and effective emergency operations. To ensure call-taking performance consistency, quality assurance is implemented to evaluate and refine call-takers' skillsets. However, traditional human-led evaluations struggle with high call volumes, leading to low coverage and delayed assessments. We introduce LogiDebrief, an AI-driven framework that automates traditional 9-1-1 call debriefing by integrating Signal-Temporal Logic (STL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for fully-covered rigorous performance evaluation. LogiDebrief formalizes call-taking requirements as logical specifications, enabling systematic assessment of 9-1-1 calls against procedural guidelines. It employs a three-step verification process: (1) contextual understanding to identify responder types, incident classifications, and critical conditions; (2) STL-based runtime checking with LLM integration to ensure compliance; and (3) automated aggregation of results into quality assurance reports. Beyond its technical contributions, LogiDebrief has demonstrated real-world impact. Successfully deployed at Metro Nashville Department of Emergency Communications, it has assisted in debriefing 1,701 real-world calls, saving 311.85 hours of active engagement. Empirical evaluation with real-world data confirms its accuracy, while a case study and extensive user study highlight its effectiveness in enhancing call-taking performance.

<div> Keywords: AI safety, debate, alignment, honesty, research

Summary:
This paper explores the value of debate as a tool for ensuring AI safety in systems that may exceed human capabilities. It proposes using debate to identify flaws in AI outputs and steer them towards desirable traits. The paper outlines an "alignment safety case" to prevent AI systems from autonomously taking harmful actions, focusing on the risk of sabotage within AI companies. The approach involves training AI agents through debate to promote honesty and incorporating online training to maintain honesty during deployment. The safety case is based on four key claims: the agent's proficiency in the debate game, which implies honesty in the system, the system's consistency in honesty during deployment, and the tolerance for some errors in the deployment context. The paper identifies open research problems that could enhance the argument for AI system safety.

Abstract: If AI systems match or exceed human capabilities on a wide range of tasks, it may become difficult for humans to efficiently judge their actions -- making it hard to use human feedback to steer them towards desirable traits. One proposed solution is to leverage another superhuman system to point out flaws in the system's outputs via a debate. This paper outlines the value of debate for AI safety, as well as the assumptions and further research required to make debate work. It does so by sketching an ``alignment safety case'' -- an argument that an AI system will not autonomously take actions which could lead to egregious harm, despite being able to do so. The sketch focuses on the risk of an AI R\&amp;D agent inside an AI company sabotaging research, for example by producing false results. To prevent this, the agent is trained via debate, subject to exploration guarantees, to teach the system to be honest. Honesty is maintained throughout deployment via online training. The safety case rests on four key claims: (1) the agent has become good at the debate game, (2) good performance in the debate game implies that the system is mostly honest, (3) the system will not become significantly less honest during deployment, and (4) the deployment context is tolerant of some errors. We identify open research problems that, if solved, could render this a compelling argument that an AI system is safe.

Summary:<br />
This article introduces a novel Explainable AI (XAI) method to enhance the global explainability of the Isolation Forest (iForest) technique for outlier detection in machine learning. The research aims to provide a comprehensive view of the decision-making process, detailing outlier selection and decision boundaries for inliers. The method is based on the Decision Predicate Graph (DPG) to clarify the logic of ensemble methods and offers insights through the Inlier-Outlier Propagation Score (IOP-Score). By detailing how samples are identified as outliers and which features contribute to outlier identification, the proposal improves iForest's explainability and promotes a fully explainable machine learning pipeline. This approach advances the state-of-the-art by providing a holistic view of feature usage in outlier identification and explaining decision boundaries effectively. <div>

Abstract: The need to explain predictive models is well-established in modern machine learning. However, beyond model interpretability, understanding pre-processing methods is equally essential. Understanding how data modifications impact model performance improvements and potential biases and promoting a reliable pipeline is mandatory for developing robust machine learning solutions. Isolation Forest (iForest) is a widely used technique for outlier detection that performs well. Its effectiveness increases with the number of tree-based learners. However, this also complicates the explanation of outlier selection and the decision boundaries for inliers. This research introduces a novel Explainable AI (XAI) method, tackling the problem of global explainability. In detail, it aims to offer a global explanation for outlier detection to address its opaque nature. Our approach is based on the Decision Predicate Graph (DPG), which clarifies the logic of ensemble methods and provides both insights and a graph-based metric to explain how samples are identified as outliers using the proposed Inlier-Outlier Propagation Score (IOP-Score). Our proposal enhances iForest's explainability and provides a comprehensive view of the decision-making process, detailing which features contribute to outlier identification and how the model utilizes them. This method advances the state-of-the-art by providing insights into decision boundaries and a comprehensive view of holistic feature usage in outlier identification. -- thus promoting a fully explainable machine learning pipeline.

<div> Keywords: Uncertainty, Artificial Intelligence, Probabilistic Inference, First-order Logic, Tractability

Summary:
The article introduces a method for reasoning under uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence that combines expressive power with computational tractability. Drawing inspiration from human reasoning, the method extends sum-of-squares logic of expectation to relational settings, allowing for handling of hybrid variables. This approach enables lifted reasoning in the bounded-degree fragment for knowledge bases with bounded quantifier rank in polynomial time. The notion of tractability is defined in proof-theoretic terms, going beyond syntactic properties to establish completeness in sum-of-squares refutations for fixed degrees. These refutations derive the tightest bounds achievable by proofs of a given degree and size, even when faced with an a priori unknown or countably infinite set of objects. Overall, the method offers a promising framework for addressing the fundamental challenge of reasoning under uncertainty in AI. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.04115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning under uncertainty is a fundamental challenge in Artificial Intelligence. As with most of these challenges, there is a harsh dilemma between the expressive power of the language used, and the tractability of the computational problem posed by reasoning. Inspired by human reasoning, we introduce a method of first-order relational probabilistic inference that satisfies both criteria, and can handle hybrid (discrete and continuous) variables. Specifically, we extend sum-of-squares logic of expectation to relational settings, demonstrating that lifted reasoning in the bounded-degree fragment for knowledge bases of bounded quantifier rank can be performed in polynomial time, even with an a priori unknown and/or countably infinite set of objects. Crucially, our notion of tractability is framed in proof-theoretic terms, which extends beyond the syntactic properties of the language or queries. We are able to derive the tightest bounds provable by proofs of a given degree and size and establish completeness in our sum-of-squares refutations for fixed degrees.

Abstract: We introduce a new architecture for Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL) that models return distributions using normalizing flows. This approach enables flexible, unbounded support for return distributions, in contrast to categorical approaches like C51 that rely on fixed or bounded representations. It also offers richer modeling capacity to capture multi-modality, skewness, and tail behavior than quantile based approaches. Our method is significantly more parameter-efficient than categorical approaches. Standard metrics used to train existing models like KL divergence or Wasserstein distance either are scale insensitive or have biased sample gradients, especially when return supports do not overlap. To address this, we propose a novel surrogate for the Cram\`er distance, that is geometry-aware and computable directly from the return distribution's PDF, avoiding the costly CDF computation. We test our model on the ATARI-5 sub-benchmark and show that our approach outperforms PDF based models while remaining competitive with quantile based methods.

arXiv:2505.04313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce KERAIA, a novel framework and software platform for symbolic knowledge engineering designed to address the persistent challenges of representing, reasoning with, and executing knowledge in dynamic, complex, and context-sensitive environments. The central research question that motivates this work is: How can unstructured, often tacit, human expertise be effectively transformed into computationally tractable algorithms that AI systems can efficiently utilise? KERAIA seeks to bridge this gap by building on foundational concepts such as Minsky's frame-based reasoning and K-lines, while introducing significant innovations. These include Clouds of Knowledge for dynamic aggregation, Dynamic Relations (DRels) for context-sensitive inheritance, explicit Lines of Thought (LoTs) for traceable reasoning, and Cloud Elaboration for adaptive knowledge transformation. This approach moves beyond the limitations of traditional, often static, knowledge representation paradigms. KERAIA is designed with Explainable AI (XAI) as a core principle, ensuring transparency and interpretability, particularly through the use of LoTs. The paper details the framework's architecture, the KSYNTH representation language, and the General Purpose Paradigm Builder (GPPB) to integrate diverse inference methods within a unified structure. We validate KERAIA's versatility, expressiveness, and practical applicability through detailed analysis of multiple case studies spanning naval warfare simulation, industrial diagnostics in water treatment plants, and strategic decision-making in the game of RISK. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis against established knowledge representation paradigms (including ontologies, rule-based systems, and knowledge graphs) and discuss the implementation aspects and computational considerations of the KERAIA platform.

<div> Hierarchical Co-Self-Play, 3v3 multi-drone volleyball, reinforcement learning, hierarchical framework, decentralized control <br />
Summary: 
The paper presents a novel approach, Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), for learning to play 3v3 multi-drone volleyball. The task involves high-level strategic coordination and low-level agile control, posing challenges due to long-horizon dependencies and underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. HCSP separates centralized high-level decision-making from decentralized motion control, enabling training from scratch without expert demonstrations. The three-stage training pipeline includes diverse low-level skill training, high-level strategy learning through self-play, and joint fine-tuning via co-self-play. Experimental results show HCSP outperforms non-hierarchical and rule-based baselines, achieving an average win rate of 82.9% and 71.5% against a two-stage variant. Co-self-play results in emergent team behaviors like role switching and coordinated formations, showcasing the effectiveness of the hierarchical design and training scheme. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning to play 3v3 multi-drone volleyball, a new embodied competitive task that requires both high-level strategic coordination and low-level agile control. The task is turn-based, multi-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its long-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates centralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level motion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to enable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert demonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level strategy via self-play with fixed low-level controllers, and (III) joint fine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior performance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based hierarchical baselines with an average 82.9\% win rate and a 71.5\% win rate against the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team behaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.

<div> Machine Ethics, uncertainty, decisions, moral theories, Multi-Moral Markov Decision Process
Summary:
The paper discusses the importance of considering uncertainty in Machine Ethics decisions and the need to make decisions based on long-term preferable outcomes. Evaluation of outcomes may involve conflicting moral theories such as Utilitarianism, Deontology, and Virtue Ethics, each requiring different ethical representations.

Abstract: Machine Ethics decisions should consider the implications of uncertainty over decisions. Decisions should be made over sequences of actions to reach preferable outcomes long term. The evaluation of outcomes, however, may invoke one or more moral theories, which might have conflicting judgements. Each theory will require differing representations of the ethical situation. For example, Utilitarianism measures numerical values, Deontology analyses duties, and Virtue Ethics emphasises moral character. While balancing potentially conflicting moral considerations, decisions may need to be made, for example, to achieve morally neutral goals with minimal costs. In this paper, we formalise the problem as a Multi-Moral Markov Decision Process and a Multi-Moral Stochastic Shortest Path Problem. We develop a heuristic algorithm based on Multi-Objective AO*, utilising Sven-Ove Hansson's Hypothetical Retrospection procedure for ethical reasoning under uncertainty. Our approach is validated by a case study from Machine Ethics literature: the problem of whether to steal insulin for someone who needs it.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a crucial task in modeling human behavior, especially in fields as social robotics and autonomous vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while recently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack of explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a Statistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions. Our evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the ETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning methods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset. TrajEvo represents a first step toward automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics. We make our source code publicly available to foster future research at https://github.com/ai4co/trajevo.

<div> transposition tables, game tree, backpropagation, terminal evaluation function, heuristic function <br />
Summary: <br />
This paper presents experimental evaluations of modifications to the Unbounded Best-First Minimax algorithm. The modifications include the use of transposition tables, a different backpropagation strategy from Cohen-Solal, replacing exact terminal evaluation with a learned heuristic function, and implementing a completion technique that prioritizes resolved winning states. The evaluations show that using transposition tables can convert the game tree into a directed acyclic graph, improving performance. The backpropagation strategy by Cohen-Solal, updating values up to the root, enhances performance in certain scenarios. Replacing the terminal evaluation function with a learned heuristic function is beneficial in situations where exact evaluations are costly. Finally, implementing the completion technique that prioritizes resolved winning states also improves algorithm performance. These targeted modifications demonstrate how adjustments can enhance the efficiency of the Unbounded Best-First Minimax algorithm. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.04525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first experimental evaluation of four previously untested modifications of Unbounded Best-First Minimax algorithm. This algorithm explores the game tree by iteratively expanding the most promising sequences of actions based on the current partial game tree. We first evaluate the use of transposition tables, which convert the game tree into a directed acyclic graph by merging duplicate states. Second, we compare the original algorithm by Korf & Chickering with the variant proposed by Cohen-Solal, which differs in its backpropagation strategy: instead of stopping when a stable value is encountered, it updates values up to the root. This change slightly improves performance when value ties or transposition tables are involved. Third, we assess replacing the exact terminal evaluation function with the learned heuristic function. While beneficial when exact evaluations are costly, this modification reduces performance in inexpensive settings. Finally, we examine the impact of the completion technique that prioritizes resolved winning states and avoids resolved losing states. This technique also improves performance. Overall, our findings highlight how targeted modifications can enhance the efficiency of Unbounded Best-First Minimax.

<div> Formal Problem-Solving, Markov decision process, AI-based agents, FTP environments, D-FPS 
Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework for problem-solving, Formal Problem-Solving (FPS), which leverages existing FTP environments for process-verified problem-solving. Problem-solving is defined as a deterministic Markov decision process. The D-FPS framework separates solving and answer verification for better human alignment. Three benchmark problems are introduced: FormalMath500, MiniF2F-Solving, and PutnamBench-Solving. The RPE method is proposed for evaluating correctness through formal verification. Evaluation of four FTP models and two prompting methods shows limited success in solving the benchmarks. The frameworks exhibit soundness and completeness. The study emphasizes the importance of verifiability in problem-solving processes and aims to provide a structured approach for AI-based problem-solving agents. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.04528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a seemingly self-explanatory task, problem-solving has been a significant component of science and engineering. However, a general yet concrete formulation of problem-solving itself is missing. With the recent development of AI-based problem-solving agents, the demand for process-level verifiability is rapidly increasing yet underexplored. To fill these gaps, we present a principled formulation of problem-solving as a deterministic Markov decision process; a novel framework, FPS (Formal Problem-Solving), which utilizes existing FTP (formal theorem proving) environments to perform process-verified problem-solving; and D-FPS (Deductive FPS), decoupling solving and answer verification for better human-alignment. The expressiveness, soundness and completeness of the frameworks are proven. We construct three benchmarks on problem-solving: FormalMath500, a formalization of a subset of the MATH500 benchmark; MiniF2F-Solving and PutnamBench-Solving, adaptations of FTP benchmarks MiniF2F and PutnamBench. For faithful, interpretable, and human-aligned evaluation, we propose RPE (Restricted Propositional Equivalence), a symbolic approach to determine the correctness of answers by formal verification. We evaluate four prevalent FTP models and two prompting methods as baselines, solving at most 23.77% of FormalMath500, 27.47% of MiniF2F-Solving, and 0.31% of PutnamBench-Solving.

<div> Markov Decision Processes, RMDPs, uncertainties, reachability objectives, parity objectives <br />
Summary: 
The article introduces Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs), which handle uncertainties in transition probabilities. RMDPs consider a set of possible transition functions and aim to maximize the probability the agent can guarantee against an adversarial environment. The study focuses on qualitative analysis problems for reachability and parity objectives in RMDPs without assumptions about their structures. The research presents efficient algorithms with oracle access to uncertainty sets that address qualitative problems for reachability and parity objectives. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the oracle-based approach on classical RMDP examples, demonstrating scalability to RMDPs with thousands of states. <div>
arXiv:2505.04539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) generalize classical MDPs that consider uncertainties in transition probabilities by defining a set of possible transition functions. An objective is a set of runs (or infinite trajectories) of the RMDP, and the value for an objective is the maximal probability that the agent can guarantee against the adversarial environment. We consider (a) reachability objectives, where given a target set of states, the goal is to eventually arrive at one of them; and (b) parity objectives, which are a canonical representation for $\omega$-regular objectives. The qualitative analysis problem asks whether the objective can be ensured with probability 1.
  In this work, we study the qualitative problem for reachability and parity objectives on RMDPs without making any assumption over the structures of the RMDPs, e.g., unichain or aperiodic. Our contributions are twofold. We first present efficient algorithms with oracle access to uncertainty sets that solve qualitative problems of reachability and parity objectives. We then report experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of our oracle-based approach on classical RMDP examples from the literature scaling up to thousands of states.

<div> Keywords: AI hallucinations, misinformation, generative AI systems, communication phenomena, research agenda <br />
Summary: This paper introduces a conceptual framework that views AI hallucinations as a unique form of misinformation, distinct from intentionally created false information. AI systems can generate false but believable content without human intent, leading to social consequences. The framework considers hallucinations as communication phenomena rather than technical failures, highlighting the differences in production, perception, and institutional response compared to human-generated misinformation. The supply-and-demand model and distributed agency concept are utilized to explain these distinctions. The paper suggests a research agenda for communication scholars to examine the creation, spread, and reception of AI-generated hallucinated content at institutional, group, and individual levels. It calls for a reevaluation of misinformation theory to account for the influence of probabilistic, non-human actors in shaping knowledge dissemination.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes a conceptual framework for understanding AI hallucinations as a distinct form of misinformation. While misinformation scholarship has traditionally focused on human intent, generative AI systems now produce false yet plausible outputs absent of such intent. I argue that these AI hallucinations should not be treated merely as technical failures but as communication phenomena with social consequences. Drawing on a supply-and-demand model and the concept of distributed agency, the framework outlines how hallucinations differ from human-generated misinformation in production, perception, and institutional response. I conclude by outlining a research agenda for communication scholars to investigate the emergence, dissemination, and audience reception of hallucinated content, with attention to macro (institutional), meso (group), and micro (individual) levels. This work urges communication researchers to rethink the boundaries of misinformation theory in light of probabilistic, non-human actors increasingly embedded in knowledge production.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces AccLLM, an acceleration framework designed to optimize the deployment of large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices. The challenges of deploying LLMs on edge devices include intensive computations, large model sizes, memory and bandwidth demands, and limited scalability for handling long sequences. To address these challenges, AccLLM integrates pruning, Lambda-shaped attention, and a novel quantization scheme to reduce memory and bandwidth requirements while improving long-sequence generation. At the hardware level, a dedicated FPGA-based accelerator with a reconfigurable computing engine is designed to efficiently accommodate various operations stemming from the compression algorithm. Validation on the Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA shows a 4.07x improvement in energy efficiency and a 2.98x increase in throughput compared to the state-of-the-art FlightLLM approach. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved huge success in the natural language processing (NLP) field, driving a growing demand to extend their deployment from the cloud to edge devices. However, deploying LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices poses significant challenges, including (1) intensive computations and huge model sizes, (2) great memory and bandwidth demands introduced by the autoregressive generation process, and (3) limited scalability for handling long sequences. To address these challenges, we propose AccLLM, a comprehensive acceleration framework that enables efficient and fast long-context LLM inference through algorithm and hardware co-design. At the algorithmic level, we integrate (1) pruning, (2) {\Lambda}-shaped attention, and (3) an innovative W2A8KV4 (2-bit weights, 8-bit activations, and 4-bit KV cache) quantization scheme, thus effectively reducing memory and bandwidth requirements while facilitating LLMs' long-sequence generation. At the hardware level, we design a dedicated FPGA-based accelerator with a reconfigurable computing engine to effectively and flexibly accommodate diverse operations arising from our compression algorithm, thereby fully translating the algorithmic innovations into tangible hardware efficiency. We validate AccLLM on the Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA, demonstrating a 4.07x energy efficiency and a 2.98x throughput compared to the state-of-the-art work FlightLLM.

Abstract: Social media platforms enable instant and ubiquitous connectivity and are essential to social interaction and communication in our technological society. Apart from its advantages, these platforms have given rise to negative behaviors in the online community, the so-called cyberbullying. Despite the many works involving generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the literature lately, there remain opportunities to study its performance apart from zero/few-shot learning strategies. Accordingly, we propose an innovative and real-time solution for cyberbullying detection that leverages stream-based Machine Learning (ML) models able to process the incoming samples incrementally and Large Language Models (LLMS) for feature engineering to address the evolving nature of abusive and hate speech online. An explainability dashboard is provided to promote the system's trustworthiness, reliability, and accountability. Results on experimental data report promising performance close to 90 % in all evaluation metrics and surpassing those obtained by competing works in the literature. Ultimately, our proposal contributes to the safety of online communities by timely detecting abusive behavior to prevent long-lasting harassment and reduce the negative consequences in society.

Summary:
APSQ is a novel method introduced in this study to address the excessive memory demands caused by high-precision partial sums (PSUMs) in DNN accelerators. By integrating PSUM accumulation into the quantization framework, APSQ achieves nearly lossless performance on NLP and CV tasks across various models while compressing PSUMs to INT8. The proposed grouping strategy, which combines APSQ with PSUM quantization in a reconfigurable architecture, results in significant energy cost reductions of 28-87%. The study also demonstrates the effectiveness of APSQ for large language models through experiments on LLaMA2-7B. The code for APSQ implementation is available on GitHub for further exploration and development. <div>

Abstract: DNN accelerators, significantly advanced by model compression and specialized dataflow techniques, have marked considerable progress. However, the frequent access of high-precision partial sums (PSUMs) leads to excessive memory demands in architectures utilizing input/weight stationary dataflows. Traditional compression strategies have typically overlooked PSUM quantization, which may account for 69% of power consumption. This study introduces a novel Additive Partial Sum Quantization (APSQ) method, seamlessly integrating PSUM accumulation into the quantization framework. A grouping strategy that combines APSQ with PSUM quantization enhanced by a reconfigurable architecture is further proposed. The APSQ performs nearly lossless on NLP and CV tasks across BERT, Segformer, and EfficientViT models while compressing PSUMs to INT8. This leads to a notable reduction in energy costs by 28-87%. Extended experiments on LLaMA2-7B demonstrate the potential of APSQ for large language models. Code is available at https://github.com/Yonghao-Tan/APSQ.

Summary:
FASTLIBRA is introduced as a Multi-LoRA caching system that aims to optimize serving performance by considering usage dependencies when caching LoRAs and KV caches. It consists of a dependency-aware cache manager and a performance-driven cache swapper. The cache manager maintains usage dependencies between LoRAs and KV caches in a unified caching pool during inference. The cache swapper decides when to swap in or out LoRAs and KV caches based on a unified cost model and the availability of high bandwidth memory (HBM). Experimental results demonstrate that FASTLIBRA significantly reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by 63.4% on average compared to existing methods, showcasing its effectiveness in improving inference performance for task-specific Large Language Model applications. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Multiple Low-Rank Adapters (Multi-LoRAs) are gaining popularity for task-specific Large Language Model (LLM) applications. For multi-LoRA serving, caching hot KV caches and LoRA adapters in high bandwidth memory of accelerations can improve inference performance. However, existing Multi-LoRA inference systems fail to optimize serving performance like Time-To-First-Toke (TTFT), neglecting usage dependencies when caching LoRAs and KVs. We therefore propose FASTLIBRA, a Multi-LoRA caching system to optimize the serving performance. FASTLIBRA comprises a dependency-aware cache manager and a performance-driven cache swapper. The cache manager maintains the usage dependencies between LoRAs and KV caches during the inference with a unified caching pool. The cache swapper determines the swap-in or out of LoRAs and KV caches based on a unified cost model, when the HBM is idle or busy, respectively. Experimental results show that ELORA reduces the TTFT by 63.4% on average, compared to state-of-the-art works.

Summary: 
This study introduces a volatility-guided Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for portfolio optimization. The framework aims to dynamically construct portfolios based on investors' risk profiles by pre-selecting assets categorized into aggressive, moderate, and conservative volatility groups using the GARCH model.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization requires dynamic allocation of funds by balancing the risk and return tradeoff under dynamic market conditions. With the recent advancements in AI, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has gained prominence in providing adaptive and scalable strategies for portfolio optimization. However, the success of these strategies depends not only on their ability to adapt to market dynamics but also on the careful pre-selection of assets that influence overall portfolio performance. Incorporating the investor's preference in pre-selecting assets for a portfolio is essential in refining their investment strategies. This study proposes a volatility-guided DRL-based portfolio optimization framework that dynamically constructs portfolios based on investors' risk profiles. The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model is utilized for volatility forecasting of stocks and categorizes them based on their volatility as aggressive, moderate, and conservative. The DRL agent is then employed to learn an optimal investment policy by interacting with the historical market data. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is established using stocks from the Dow $30$ index. The proposed investor-specific DRL-based portfolios outperformed the baseline strategies by generating consistent risk-adjusted returns.

Summary:
Splitwiser proposes a methodology for efficient inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) by splitting the prompt computation and token generation phases onto the same GPU. This approach aims to reduce overhead, improve memory access, and enhance cache utilization during LLM inference. By eliminating the need for data transfer across devices, Splitwiser minimizes network-related overheads. The methodology is implemented on two popular LLM architectures, Huggingface, and vLLM, with the code being open-sourced for both implementations. Preliminary results and analysis show promising outcomes in optimizing LLM inference processes on GPUs. <div>

Abstract: Efficient inference of LLMs remains a crucial challenge, with two main phases: a compute-intensive prompt computation and a memory-intensive token generation. Despite existing batching and scheduling techniques, token generation phases fail to fully utilize compute resources, especially when compared to prompt computation phases. To address these challenges, we propose Splitwiser, a methodology that splits the two phases of an LLM inference request onto the same GPU, thereby reducing overhead and improving memory access and cache utilization. By eliminating the need to transfer data across devices, Splitwiser aims to minimize network-related overheads. In this report, we describe the basic structure of our proposed pipeline while sharing preliminary results and analysis. We implement our proposed multiprocessing design on two widely-used and independent LLM architectures: Huggingface and vLLM. We open-source our code for the respective implementations: 1) Huggingface (https://github.com/asad-aali/splitwiser), and 2) vLLM (https://github.com/adney11/vllm-sysml).

Summary:<br />
This study compares three spiking neuron circuit architectures - Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), Morris-Lecar (ML), and Axon-Hillock (AH) - implemented in a 7 nm FinFET technology. The Axon-Hillock design demonstrated the highest throughput with firing rates up to 3 GHz and low energy costs. The Morris-Lecar architecture excelled in low-power operation and biological bursting behavior. The Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire design showed benefits for high-frequency operation but had slightly higher static leakage. The 7 nm FinFET technology significantly improved energy efficiency and speed compared to previous node implementations, despite increased subthreshold leakage. By analyzing the design trade-offs for each architecture, this work provides insights for optimizing spiking neuron circuits in advanced nanoscale technologies to achieve neuromorphic hardware capable of ultra-low-power operation and high computational throughput.<br /> <div>

In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative study of three spiking neuron circuit architectures-Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), Morris-Lecar (ML), and Axon-Hillock (AH)-implemented in a 7 nm FinFET technology. Through extensive SPICE simulations, we explore the optimization of spiking frequency, energy per spike, and static power consumption. Our results show that the AH design achieves the highest throughput, demonstrating multi-gigahertz firing rates (up to 3 GHz) with attojoule energy costs. By contrast, the ML architecture excels in subthreshold to near-threshold regimes, offering robust low-power operation (as low as 0.385 aJ/spike) and biological bursting behavior. Although LIF benefits from a decoupled current mirror for high-frequency operation, it exhibits slightly higher static leakage compared to ML and AH at elevated supply voltages. Comparisons with previous node implementations (22 nm planar, 28 nm) reveal that 7 nm FinFETs can drastically boost energy efficiency and speed albeit at the cost of increased subthreshold leakage in deep subthreshold regions. By quantifying design trade-offs for each neuron architecture, our work provides a roadmap for optimizing spiking neuron circuits in advanced nanoscale technologies to deliver neuromorphic hardware capable of both ultra-low-power operation and high computational throughput.

Abstract: In today's cross-platform social media landscape, understanding factors that drive engagement for multimodal content, especially text paired with visuals, remains complex. This study investigates how rewriting Reddit post titles adapted from YouTube video titles affects user engagement. First, we build and analyze a large dataset of Reddit posts sharing YouTube videos, revealing that 21% of post titles are minimally modified. Statistical analysis demonstrates that title rewrites measurably improve engagement. Second, we design a controlled, multi-phase experiment to rigorously isolate the effects of textual variations by neutralizing confounding factors like video popularity, timing, and community norms. Comprehensive statistical tests reveal that effective title rewrites tend to feature emotional resonance, lexical richness, and alignment with community-specific norms. Lastly, pairwise ranking prediction experiments using a fine-tuned BERT classifier achieves 74% accuracy, significantly outperforming near-random baselines, including GPT-4o. These results validate that our controlled dataset effectively minimizes confounding effects, allowing advanced models to both learn and demonstrate the impact of textual features on engagement. By bridging quantitative rigor with qualitative insights, this study uncovers engagement dynamics and offers a robust framework for future cross-platform, multimodal content strategies.

Summary: <br />
The article discusses the importance of co-designing algorithms, software, and hardware for achieving optimal performance in Large Language Models (LLMs). It highlights the limitations of relying on a single dominant platform, leading to vendor lock-in and hindering the development of new AI hardware. The authors propose a solution that combines just-in-time (JIT) compilation with kernel parameter autotuning to enable portable and state-of-the-art performance in LLM execution without requiring code changes. By focusing on flash attention, a critical LLM kernel, the approach explores a significantly higher number of kernel parameter configurations, generates more diverse code, and even surpasses vendor-optimized implementations. Moreover, the proposed method reduces kernel code size by a substantial margin and eliminates the need for manual code optimizations. The results indicate that autotuning shows promise in promoting model portability across different GPU vendors. <br /> <div>

Abstract: As LLMs grow in complexity, achieving state-of-the-art performance requires tight co-design across algorithms, software, and hardware. Today's reliance on a single dominant platform limits portability, creates vendor lock-in, and raises barriers for new AI hardware. In this work, we make the case for combining just-in-time (JIT) compilation with kernel parameter autotuning to enable portable, state-of-the-art performance LLM execution without code changes. Focusing on flash attention -- a widespread performance-critical LLM kernel -- we demonstrate that this approach explores up to 15x more kernel parameter configurations, produces significantly more diverse code across multiple dimensions, and even outperforms vendor-optimized implementations by up to 230%, all while reducing kernel code size by 70x and eliminating manual code optimizations. Our results highlight autotuning as a promising path to unlocking model portability across GPU vendors.

Summary:
Cardiac arrhythmias are a significant health concern, necessitating accurate and timely detection for prevention of life-threatening events. While electrocardiography (ECG) is the gold standard for diagnosis, manual interpretation is laborious and error-prone. Deep learning has improved automated ECG analysis, but existing models often lack interpretability and are computationally intensive. This study introduces two lightweight 1D convolutional neural networks, ArrhythmiNet V1 and V2, designed for real-time arrhythmia classification on resource-constrained devices. These models achieve high accuracy while maintaining small memory footprints. Additionally, the inclusion of interpretability techniques like Shapley Additive Explanations and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping enhances clinical transparency by revealing physiologically meaningful patterns. The study also addresses the trade-offs between performance and efficiency, highlighting the importance of dataset diversity and generalizability in wearable ECG monitoring systems.

Abstract: Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of life-threatening cardiac events, highlighting the urgent need for accurate and timely detection. Electrocardiography (ECG) remains the clinical gold standard for arrhythmia diagnosis; however, manual interpretation is time-consuming, dependent on clinical expertise, and prone to human error. Although deep learning has advanced automated ECG analysis, many existing models abstract away the signal's intrinsic temporal and morphological features, lack interpretability, and are computationally intensive-hindering their deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this work, we propose two novel lightweight 1D convolutional neural networks, ArrhythmiNet V1 and V2, optimized for efficient, real-time arrhythmia classification on edge devices. Inspired by MobileNet's depthwise separable convolutional design, these models maintain memory footprints of just 302.18 KB and 157.76 KB, respectively, while achieving classification accuracies of 0.99 (V1) and 0.98 (V2) on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset across five classes: Normal Sinus Rhythm, Left Bundle Branch Block, Right Bundle Branch Block, Atrial Premature Contraction, and Premature Ventricular Contraction. In order to ensure clinical transparency and relevance, we integrate Shapley Additive Explanations and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, enabling both local and global interpretability. These techniques highlight physiologically meaningful patterns such as the QRS complex and T-wave that contribute to the model's predictions. We also discuss performance-efficiency trade-offs and address current limitations related to dataset diversity and generalizability. Overall, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of combining interpretability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency in practical, wearable, and embedded ECG monitoring systems.

<div> Keywords: uncertainty quantification, multi-modal language models, calibration, cross-modal consistency, temperature scaling

Summary:
This article introduces a new approach for calibrating uncertainty quantification in multi-modal large language models (LLMs). Current methods for uncertainty quantification often lack calibration when the model consistently generates incorrect responses, leading to inaccuracies in confidence levels. To address this issue, the proposed approach utilizes cross-modal consistency alongside self-consistency to improve calibration. By grounding textual responses to visual inputs and incorporating confidence from a grounding model, the overall confidence is calibrated. Temperature scaling is applied to calibrate the grounding model's confidence. The approach is evaluated on tasks such as medical question answering and visual question answering using multi-modal models like LLaVA-Med and LLaVA, resulting in significantly improved calibration on both tasks. <div>

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for calibrating uncertainty quantification (UQ) tailored for multi-modal large language models (LLMs). Existing state-of-the-art UQ methods rely on consistency among multiple responses generated by the LLM on an input query under diverse settings. However, these approaches often report higher confidence in scenarios where the LLM is consistently incorrect. This leads to a poorly calibrated confidence with respect to accuracy. To address this, we leverage cross-modal consistency in addition to self-consistency to improve the calibration of the multi-modal models. Specifically, we ground the textual responses to the visual inputs. The confidence from the grounding model is used to calibrate the overall confidence. Given that using a grounding model adds its own uncertainty in the pipeline, we apply temperature scaling - a widely accepted parametric calibration technique - to calibrate the grounding model's confidence in the accuracy of generated responses. We evaluate the proposed approach across multiple multi-modal tasks, such as medical question answering (Slake) and visual question answering (VQAv2), considering multi-modal models such as LLaVA-Med and LLaVA. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly improved calibration on both tasks.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a method combining Diffusion and Transformer models to augment time-series data for deep neural network training. By using a diffusion denoising model to generate initial action data and a Transformer model for predicting subsequent actions, augmented data is produced effectively. A weighted loss function aids in achieving convergence. The method demonstrates improved model performance with augmented data compared to traditional methods. This approach addresses the lack of focus on augmenting time-series data, a gap in current data augmentation techniques. <div>

Abstract: With the development of Artificial Intelligence, numerous real-world tasks have been accomplished using technology integrated with deep learning. To achieve optimal performance, deep neural networks typically require large volumes of data for training. Although advances in data augmentation have facilitated the acquisition of vast datasets, most of this data is concentrated in domains like images and speech. However, there has been relatively less focus on augmenting time-series data. To address this gap and generate a substantial amount of time-series data, we propose a simple and effective method that combines the Diffusion and Transformer models. By utilizing an adjusted diffusion denoising model to generate a large volume of initial time-step action data, followed by employing a Transformer model to predict subsequent actions, and incorporating a weighted loss function to achieve convergence, the method demonstrates its effectiveness. Using the performance improvement of the model after applying augmented data as a benchmark, and comparing the results with those obtained without data augmentation or using traditional data augmentation methods, this approach shows its capability to produce high-quality augmented data.

Abstract: Online fine-tuning vision-language model (VLM) agents with reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise for equipping agents with multi-step, goal-oriented capabilities in dynamic environments. However, their open-ended textual action space and non-end-to-end nature of action generation present significant challenges to effective online exploration in RL, e.g., explosion of the exploration space. We propose a novel online fine-tuning method, Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning (CoSo), better suited to the textual output space of VLM agents. Compared to prior methods that assign uniform uncertainty to all tokens, CoSo leverages counterfactual reasoning to dynamically assess the causal influence of individual tokens on post-processed actions. By prioritizing the exploration of action-critical tokens while reducing the impact of semantically redundant or low-impact tokens, CoSo enables a more targeted and efficient online rollout process. We provide theoretical analysis proving CoSo's convergence and policy improvement guarantees, and extensive empirical evaluations supporting CoSo's effectiveness. Our results across a diverse set of agent tasks, including Android device control, card gaming, and embodied AI, highlight its remarkable ability to enhance exploration efficiency and deliver consistent performance gains.

Abstract: The proliferation of open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse downstream tasks necessitates efficient model selection, given the impracticality of fine-tuning all candidates due to computational constraints. Despite the recent advances in LLM selection, a fundamental research question largely remains nascent: how can we model the dynamic behaviors of LLMs during fine-tuning, thereby enhancing our understanding of their generalization performance across diverse downstream tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that provides a proper lens to assess the generalization capabilities of LLMs, thereby enabling accurate and efficient LLM selection for downstream applications. In particular, we first derive a Hessian-based PAC-Bayes generalization bound that unveils fine-tuning dynamics of LLMs and then introduce LENSLLM, a Neural Tangent Kernel(NTK)-based Rectified Scaling Model that enables accurate performance predictions across diverse tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive empirical results on 3 large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves up to 91.1% accuracy and reduces up to 88.5% computational cost in LLM selection, outperforming 5 state-of-the-art methods. We open-source our proposed LENSLLM model and corresponding results at the Github link: https://github.com/Susan571/LENSLLM.git.

Summary:
Human networks play a crucial role in societal outcomes, and understanding them is essential for promoting positive results. In the study, various modeling methods were compared in the Junior High Game (JHG) to learn models of human behavior in a strategic network game. The highest-performing method, hCAB, modeled the population's distribution and assumed community-aware behavior, which closely mirrored human group dynamics in small societies. A user study showed that humans could not distinguish hCAB agents from real humans, indicating that hCAB behavior plausibly reflects human behavior in the game. This research provides insights into the importance of considering community-aware behavior and population distribution when modeling human networks in strategic games. <div>

Abstract: Human networks greatly impact important societal outcomes, including wealth and health inequality, poverty, and bullying. As such, understanding human networks is critical to learning how to promote favorable societal outcomes. As a step toward better understanding human networks, we compare and contrast several methods for learning models of human behavior in a strategic network game called the Junior High Game (JHG). These modeling methods differ with respect to the assumptions they use to parameterize human behavior (behavior vs. community-aware behavior) and the statistical moments they model (mean vs. distribution). Results show that the highest-performing method models the population's distribution rather than the mean and assumes humans use community-aware behavior rather than behavior matching. When applied to small societies (6-11 individuals), this learned model, called hCAB, closely mirrors the population dynamics of human groups (with some differences). Additionally, a user study reveals that human participants were unable to distinguish hCAB agents from other humans, thus illustrating that individual hCAB behavior plausibly mirrors human behavior in this strategic network game.

Summary:
Current foundation models (FMs) in machine learning rely on token representations that fragment multimodal data into discrete tokens, limiting their ability to capture real-world knowledge and relationships. This approach hinders the models' performance in maintaining semantic coherence, capturing spatial-temporal dynamics, and conducting causal reasoning. Scaling up model size or expanding datasets does not address these limitations. This position paper advocates for using digital twin (DT) representations, which are outcome-driven digital representations of physical processes, as an alternative to token representations for building FMs. DT representations provide physically grounded, domain knowledge-encoded representations that preserve the continuous nature of real-world processes. By leveraging DT representations, FMs can overcome their current challenges and enhance their performance in various tasks requiring multimodal data processing.

Abstract: Current foundation models (FMs) rely on token representations that directly fragment continuous real-world multimodal data into discrete tokens. They limit FMs to learning real-world knowledge and relationships purely through statistical correlation rather than leveraging explicit domain knowledge. Consequently, current FMs struggle with maintaining semantic coherence across modalities, capturing fine-grained spatial-temporal dynamics, and performing causal reasoning. These limitations cannot be overcome by simply scaling up model size or expanding datasets. This position paper argues that the machine learning community should consider digital twin (DT) representations, which are outcome-driven digital representations that serve as building blocks for creating virtual replicas of physical processes, as an alternative to the token representation for building FMs. Finally, we discuss how DT representations can address these challenges by providing physically grounded representations that explicitly encode domain knowledge and preserve the continuous nature of real-world processes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in various natural language processing tasks; however, their application to graph-related problems remains limited, primarily due to scalability constraints and the absence of dedicated mechanisms for processing graph structures. Existing approaches predominantly integrate LLMs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), using GNNs as feature encoders or auxiliary components. However, directly encoding graph structures within LLMs has been underexplored, particularly in the context of large-scale graphs where token limitations hinder effective representation. To address these challenges, we propose SDM-InstructGLM, a novel instruction-tuned Graph Language Model (InstructGLM) framework that enhances scalability and efficiency without relying on GNNs. Our method introduces a similarity-degree-based biased random walk mechanism, which selectively samples and encodes graph information based on node-feature similarity and degree centrality, ensuring an adaptive and structured representation within the LLM. This approach significantly improves token efficiency, mitigates information loss due to random sampling, and enhances performance on graph-based tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the feasibility of LLM-only graph processing, enabling scalable and interpretable Graph Language Models (GLMs) optimized through instruction-based fine-tuning. This work paves the way for GNN-free approaches to graph learning, leveraging LLMs as standalone graph reasoning models. Our source code is available on GitHub.

- Introduced a probabilistic global optimization technique in the second stage to jointly identify low-rank and sparse structures.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank and sparse composite approximation is a natural idea to compress Large Language Models (LLMs). However, such an idea faces two primary challenges that adversely affect the performance of existing methods. The first challenge relates to the interaction and cooperation between low-rank and sparse matrices, while the second involves determining weight allocation across different layers, as redundancy varies considerably among them. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage LLM compression method with the capability of global rank and sparsity optimization. It is noteworthy that the overall optimization space is vast, making comprehensive optimization computationally prohibitive. Therefore, to reduce the optimization space, our first stage utilizes robust principal component analysis to decompose the weight matrices of LLMs into low-rank and sparse components, which span the low dimensional and sparse spaces containing the resultant low-rank and sparse matrices, respectively. In the second stage, we propose a probabilistic global optimization technique to jointly identify the low-rank and sparse structures within the above two spaces. The appealing feature of our approach is its ability to automatically detect the redundancy across different layers and to manage the interaction between the sparse and low-rank components. Extensive experimental results indicate that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art techniques for sparsification and composite approximation.

Summary:   
QR-Adaptor proposes a unified strategy for fine-tuning large language models by jointly optimizing quantization components and low-rank spaces based on partial calibration data. Unlike previous methods, QR-Adaptor considers the synergy between precision and rank allocation, enhancing model performance continuously. By treating the precision and rank allocation as a discrete optimization problem guided by downstream performance and memory usage, QR-Adaptor achieves a 4.89% accuracy improvement on GSM8K compared to state-of-the-art quantized LoRA fine-tuning methods. The approach even surpasses the performance of a 16-bit fine-tuned model while maintaining the memory footprint of the 4-bit setting. QR-Adaptor's unique approach to dynamic mixed precision provides a memory-friendly solution for optimizing quantized large language models.

Abstract: QLoRA effectively combines low-bit quantization and LoRA to achieve memory-friendly fine-tuning for large language models (LLM). Recently, methods based on SVD for continuous update iterations to initialize LoRA matrices to accommodate quantization errors have generally failed to consistently improve performance. Dynamic mixed precision is a natural idea for continuously improving the fine-tuning performance of quantized models, but previous methods often optimize low-rank subspaces or quantization components separately, without considering their synergy. To address this, we propose \textbf{QR-Adaptor}, a unified, gradient-free strategy that uses partial calibration data to jointly search the quantization components and the rank of low-rank spaces for each layer, thereby continuously improving model performance. QR-Adaptor does not minimize quantization error but treats precision and rank allocation as a discrete optimization problem guided by actual downstream performance and memory usage. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) quantized LoRA fine-tuning methods, our approach achieves a 4.89\% accuracy improvement on GSM8K, and in some cases even outperforms the 16-bit fine-tuned model while maintaining the memory footprint of the 4-bit setting.

<div> Keyword: RWKV, Post Training Quantization, Transformer, resource-constrained devices, performance degradation

Summary:
RWKVQuant is a novel Post Training Quantization (PTQ) framework designed specifically for RWKV models. It addresses the challenges faced by RWKV models when deployed to resource-constrained devices. The framework consists of two key techniques: a coarse-to-fine proxy for adaptively selecting quantization approaches based on weight properties, and a codebook optimization algorithm for cluster-based quantization methods. These techniques enable RWKVQuant to quantize RWKV-6-14B model into about 3-bit with less than 1% accuracy loss and 2.14x speed up. The challenges identified in RWKV models include non-linear operators hindering parameter-fusion and a larger amount of uniformly distributed weights affecting cluster-based quantization. Through experimental results, RWKVQuant demonstrates significantly improved performance compared to traditional PTQ methods when applied to RWKV models. Overall, RWKVQuant provides an efficient solution for reducing model size and inference latency while maintaining high accuracy in RWKV models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: RWKV is a modern RNN architecture with comparable performance to Transformer, but still faces challenges when deployed to resource-constrained devices. Post Training Quantization (PTQ), which is a an essential technique to reduce model size and inference latency, has been widely used in Transformer models. However, it suffers significant degradation of performance when applied to RWKV. This paper investigates and identifies two key constraints inherent in the properties of RWKV: (1) Non-linear operators hinder the parameter-fusion of both smooth- and rotation-based quantization, introducing extra computation overhead. (2) The larger amount of uniformly distributed weights poses challenges for cluster-based quantization, leading to reduced accuracy. To this end, we propose RWKVQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for RWKV models, consisting of two novel techniques: (1) a coarse-to-fine proxy capable of adaptively selecting different quantization approaches by assessing the uniformity and identifying outliers in the weights, and (2) a codebook optimization algorithm that enhances the performance of cluster-based quantization methods for element-wise multiplication in RWKV. Experiments show that RWKVQuant can quantize RWKV-6-14B into about 3-bit with less than 1% accuracy loss and 2.14x speed up.

<div> quantization, Mixture-of-Experts, large language models, efficiency, scalability

Summary:
Expert-Balanced Self-Sampling (EBSS) and Affinity-Guided Quantization (AGQ) are proposed in the MoEQuant framework for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language models to address challenges in post-training quantization (PTQ). MoE models face memory overheads that limit deployment and adoption due to inter- and intra-expert imbalance. EBSS balances expert distributions in the calibration set, while AGQ considers sample-expert affinities in the quantization process. Experiments show that MoEQuant significantly improves performance, with a more than 10-point accuracy gain in HumanEval for DeepSeekMoE-16B under 4-bit quantization. This novel framework enhances efficiency and scalability of MoE LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language models (LLMs), which leverage dynamic routing and sparse activation to enhance efficiency and scalability, have achieved higher performance while reducing computational costs. However, these models face significant memory overheads, limiting their practical deployment and broader adoption. Post-training quantization (PTQ), a widely used method for compressing LLMs, encounters severe accuracy degradation and diminished generalization performance when applied to MoE models. This paper investigates the impact of MoE's sparse and dynamic characteristics on quantization and identifies two primary challenges: (1) Inter-expert imbalance, referring to the uneven distribution of samples across experts, which leads to insufficient and biased calibration for less frequently utilized experts; (2) Intra-expert imbalance, arising from MoE's unique aggregation mechanism, which leads to varying degrees of correlation between different samples and their assigned experts. To address these challenges, we propose MoEQuant, a novel quantization framework tailored for MoE LLMs. MoE-Quant includes two novel techniques: 1) Expert-Balanced Self-Sampling (EBSS) is an efficient sampling method that efficiently constructs a calibration set with balanced expert distributions by leveraging the cumulative probabilities of tokens and expert balance metrics as guiding factors. 2) Affinity-Guided Quantization (AGQ), which incorporates affinities between experts and samples into the quantization process, thereby accurately assessing the impact of individual samples on different experts within the MoE layer. Experiments demonstrate that MoEQuant achieves substantial performance gains (more than 10 points accuracy gain in the HumanEval for DeepSeekMoE-16B under 4-bit quantization) and boosts efficiency.

Abstract: This article introduces Perception-Informed Neural Networks (PrINNs), a framework designed to incorporate perception-based information into neural networks, addressing both systems with known and unknown physics laws or differential equations. Moreover, PrINNs extend the concept of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and their variants, offering a platform for the integration of diverse forms of perception precisiation, including singular, probability distribution, possibility distribution, interval, and fuzzy graph. In fact, PrINNs allow neural networks to model dynamical systems by integrating expert knowledge and perception-based information through loss functions, enabling the creation of modern data-driven models. Some of the key contributions include Mixture of Experts Informed Neural Networks (MOEINNs), which combine heterogeneous expert knowledge into the network, and Transformed-Knowledge Informed Neural Networks (TKINNs), which facilitate the incorporation of meta-information for enhanced model performance. Additionally, Fuzzy-Informed Neural Networks (FINNs) as a modern class of fuzzy deep neural networks leverage fuzzy logic constraints within a deep learning architecture, allowing online training without pre-training and eliminating the need for defuzzification. PrINNs represent a significant step forward in bridging the gap between traditional physics-based modeling and modern data-driven approaches, enabling neural networks to learn from both structured physics laws and flexible perception-based rules. This approach empowers neural networks to operate in uncertain environments, model complex systems, and discover new forms of differential equations, making PrINNs a powerful tool for advancing computational science and engineering.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel online data training framework that integrates dynamic data selection and augmentation. By estimating each sample's local density and semantic consistency, the method allows for targeted selection of samples suitable for augmentation while filtering out noisy or ambiguous data. This approach enables significant dataset size reduction without sacrificing model generalization. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on various datasets and architectures, achieving a 50% reduction in training costs on ImageNet-1k without compromising performance. Additionally, the method enhances noise resistance and improves model robustness, demonstrating its practical utility in real-world scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Dynamic data selection aims to accelerate training with lossless performance. However, reducing training data inherently limits data diversity, potentially hindering generalization. While data augmentation is widely used to enhance diversity, it is typically not optimized in conjunction with selection. As a result, directly combining these techniques fails to fully exploit their synergies. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel online data training framework that, for the first time, unifies dynamic data selection and augmentation, achieving both training efficiency and enhanced performance. Our method estimates each sample's joint distribution of local density and multimodal semantic consistency, allowing for the targeted selection of augmentation-suitable samples while suppressing the inclusion of noisy or ambiguous data. This enables a more significant reduction in dataset size without sacrificing model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on various benchmark datasets and architectures, e.g., reducing 50\% training costs on ImageNet-1k with lossless performance. Furthermore, our approach enhances noise resistance and improves model robustness, reinforcing its practical utility in real-world scenarios.

- The model leverages knowledge about negative class to improve learning of positive class in a semi-supervised manner.

Abstract: This paper introduces ScarceGAN which focuses on identification of extremely rare or scarce samples from multi-dimensional longitudinal telemetry data with small and weak label prior. We specifically address: (i) severe scarcity in positive class, stemming from both underlying organic skew in the data, as well as extremely limited labels; (ii) multi-class nature of the negative samples, with uneven density distributions and partially overlapping feature distributions; and (iii) massively unlabelled data leading to tiny and weak prior on both positive and negative classes, and possibility of unseen or unknown behavior in the unlabelled set, especially in the negative class. Although related to PU learning problems, we contend that knowledge (or lack of it) on the negative class can be leveraged to learn the compliment of it (i.e., the positive class) better in a semi-supervised manner. To this effect, ScarceGAN re-formulates semi-supervised GAN by accommodating weakly labelled multi-class negative samples and the available positive samples. It relaxes the supervised discriminator's constraint on exact differentiation between negative samples by introducing a 'leeway' term for samples with noisy prior. We propose modifications to the cost objectives of discriminator, in supervised and unsupervised path as well as that of the generator. For identifying risky players in skill gaming, this formulation in whole gives us a recall of over 85% (~60% jump over vanilla semi-supervised GAN) on our scarce class with very minimal verbosity in the unknown space. Further ScarceGAN outperforms the recall benchmarks established by recent GAN based specialized models for the positive imbalanced class identification and establishes a new benchmark in identifying one of rare attack classes (0.09%) in the intrusion dataset from the KDDCUP99 challenge.

Summary:
The paper introduces a certifiable and cost-efficient evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs). It addresses the challenges of evaluating exponentially growing models by adapting to different evaluation objectives and providing confidence intervals with high probability. The framework quantifies the test sample complexity needed for evaluation and utilizes a partition-based algorithm, Cer-Eval, to minimize evaluation costs. Real-world experiments show that Cer-Eval can save 20% to 40% of test points while maintaining estimation accuracy comparable to current methods and providing a 95% confidence guarantee. This approach fills a gap by offering systematic analysis and guidance for evaluating LLMs, ensuring sufficient test data selection for reliable assessment. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As foundation models continue to scale, the size of trained models grows exponentially, presenting significant challenges for their evaluation. Current evaluation practices involve curating increasingly large datasets to assess the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, there is a lack of systematic analysis and guidance on determining the sufficiency of test data or selecting informative samples for evaluation. This paper introduces a certifiable and cost-efficient evaluation framework for LLMs. Our framework adapts to different evaluation objectives and outputs confidence intervals that contain true values with high probability. We use ``test sample complexity'' to quantify the number of test points needed for a certifiable evaluation and derive tight bounds on test sample complexity. Based on the developed theory, we develop a partition-based algorithm, named Cer-Eval, that adaptively selects test points to minimize the cost of LLM evaluation. Real-world experiments demonstrate that Cer-Eval can save 20% to 40% test points across various benchmarks, while maintaining an estimation error level comparable to the current evaluation process and providing a 95% confidence guarantee.

Abstract: Urban transportation plays a vital role in modern city life, affecting how efficiently people and goods move around. This study analyzes transportation patterns using two datasets: the NYC Taxi Trip dataset from New York City and the Pathao Food Trip dataset from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Our goal is to identify key trends in demand, peak times, and important geographical hotspots. We start with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the basic characteristics of the datasets. Next, we perform geospatial analysis to map out high-demand and low-demand regions. We use the SARIMAX model for time series analysis to forecast demand patterns, capturing seasonal and weekly variations. Lastly, we apply clustering techniques to identify significant areas of high and low demand. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing fleet management and resource allocation in both passenger transport and food delivery services. These insights can help improve service efficiency, better meet customer needs, and enhance urban transportation systems in diverse urban environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a holistic approach to attacker preference modeling from system-level audit logs using inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Adversary modeling is an important capability in cybersecurity that lets defenders characterize behaviors of potential attackers, which enables attribution to known cyber adversary groups. Existing approaches rely on documenting an ever-evolving set of attacker tools and techniques to track known threat actors. Although attacks evolve constantly, attacker behavioral preferences are intrinsic and less volatile. Our approach learns the behavioral preferences of cyber adversaries from forensics data on their tools and techniques. We model the attacker as an expert decision-making agent with unknown behavioral preferences situated in a computer host. We leverage attack provenance graphs of audit logs to derive a state-action trajectory of the attack. We test our approach on open datasets of audit logs containing real attack data. Our results demonstrate for the first time that low-level forensics data can automatically reveal an adversary's subjective preferences, which serves as an additional dimension to modeling and documenting cyber adversaries. Attackers' preferences tend to be invariant despite their different tools and indicate predispositions that are inherent to the attacker. As such, these inferred preferences can potentially serve as unique behavioral signatures of attackers and improve threat attribution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve strong performance on everyday coding tasks, but they can fail on complex tasks that require non-trivial reasoning about program semantics. Finding training examples to teach LLMs to solve these tasks can be challenging.
  In this work, we explore a method to synthetically generate code reasoning training data based on a semantic inequivalence game SInQ: a generator agent creates program variants that are semantically distinct, derived from a dataset of real-world programming tasks, while an evaluator agent has to identify input examples that cause the original programs and the generated variants to diverge in their behaviour, with the agents training each other semi-adversarially. We prove that this setup enables theoretically unlimited improvement through self-play in the limit of infinite computational resources.
  We evaluated our approach on multiple code generation and understanding benchmarks, including cross-language vulnerability detection (Lu et al., 2021), where our method improves vulnerability detection in C/C++ code despite being trained exclusively on Python code, and the challenging Python builtin identifier swap benchmark (Miceli-Barone et al., 2023), showing that whereas modern LLMs still struggle with this benchmark, our approach yields substantial improvements.
  We release the code needed to replicate the experiments, as well as the generated synthetic data, which can be used to fine-tune LLMs.

Abstract: We propose two novel test-time fine-tuning methods to improve uncertain model predictions. Our methods require no auxiliary data and use the given test instance only. Instead of performing a greedy selection of the most likely class to make a prediction, we introduce an additional focus on the likely classes step during inference. By applying a single-step gradient descent, we refine predictions when an initial forward pass indicates high uncertainty. This aligns predictions more closely with the ideal of assigning zero probability to less plausible outcomes. Our theoretical discussion provides a deeper understanding highlighting the impact on shared and non-shared features among (focus) classes. The experimental evaluation highlights accuracy gains on samples exhibiting high decision uncertainty for a diverse set of models from both the text and image domain using the same hyperparameters.

Abstract: We investigate the ability of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to perform visual perspective taking using a novel set of visual tasks inspired by established human tests. Our approach leverages carefully controlled scenes, in which a single humanoid minifigure is paired with a single object. By systematically varying spatial configurations - such as object position relative to the humanoid minifigure and the humanoid minifigure's orientation - and using both bird's-eye and surface-level views, we created 144 unique visual tasks. Each visual task is paired with a series of 7 diagnostic questions designed to assess three levels of visual cognition: scene understanding, spatial reasoning, and visual perspective taking. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, and variants of Claude Sonnet, reveals that while they excel in scene understanding, the performance declines significantly on spatial reasoning and further deteriorates on perspective-taking. Our analysis suggests a gap between surface-level object recognition and the deeper spatial and perspective reasoning required for complex visual tasks, pointing to the need for integrating explicit geometric representations and tailored training protocols in future VLM development.

Abstract: Quality-of-Service (QoS) data plays a crucial role in cloud service selection. Since users cannot access all services, QoS can be represented by a high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) matrix. Latent factor analysis (LFA) models have been proven effective as low-rank representation techniques for addressing this issue. However, most LFA models rely on first-order optimizers and use L2-norm regularization, which can lead to lower QoS prediction accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a double regularized second-order latent factor (DRSLF) model with two key ideas: a) integrating L1-norm and L2-norm regularization terms to enhance the low-rank representation performance; b) incorporating second-order information by calculating the Hessian-vector product in each conjugate gradient step. Experimental results on two real-world response-time QoS datasets demonstrate that DRSLF has a higher low-rank representation capability than two baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in solving recommendation tasks. With proven capabilities in understanding user preferences, LLM personalization has emerged as a critical area for providing tailored responses to individuals. Current studies explore personalization through prompt design and fine-tuning, paving the way for further research in personalized LLMs. However, existing approaches are either costly and inefficient in capturing diverse user preferences or fail to account for timely updates to user history. To address these gaps, we propose the Memory-Assisted Personalized LLM (MAP). Through user interactions, we first create a history profile for each user, capturing their preferences, such as ratings for historical items. During recommendation, we extract relevant memory based on similarity, which is then incorporated into the prompts to enhance personalized recommendations. In our experiments, we evaluate MAP using a sequential rating prediction task under two scenarios: single domain, where memory and tasks are from the same category (e.g., movies), and cross-domain (e.g., memory from movies and recommendation tasks in books). The results show that MAP outperforms regular LLM-based recommenders that integrate user history directly through prompt design. Moreover, as user history grows, MAP's advantage increases in both scenarios, making it more suitable for addressing successive personalized user requests.

<title>Intelligently Augmented Contrastive Tensor Factorization: Empowering Multi-dimensional Time Series Classification in Low-Data Environments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03825</link>

Abstract: Classification of multi-dimensional time series from real-world systems require fine-grained learning of complex features such as cross-dimensional dependencies and intra-class variations-all under the practical challenge of low training data availability. However, standard deep learning (DL) struggles to learn generalizable features in low-data environments due to model overfitting. We propose a versatile yet data-efficient framework, Intelligently Augmented Contrastive Tensor Factorization (ITA-CTF), to learn effective representations from multi-dimensional time series. The CTF module learns core explanatory components of the time series (e.g., sensor factors, temporal factors), and importantly, their joint dependencies. Notably, unlike standard tensor factorization (TF), the CTF module incorporates a new contrastive loss optimization to induce similarity learning and class-awareness into the learnt representations for better classification performance. To strengthen this contrastive learning, the preceding ITA module generates targeted but informative augmentations that highlight realistic intra-class patterns in the original data, while preserving class-wise properties. This is achieved by dynamically sampling a "soft" class prototype to guide the warping of each query data sample, which results in an augmentation that is intelligently pattern-mixed between the "soft" class prototype and the query sample. These augmentations enable the CTF module to recognize complex intra-class variations despite the limited original training data, and seek out invariant class-wise properties for accurate classification performance. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on five different classification tasks. Compared to standard TF and several DL benchmarks, notable performance improvements up to 18.7% were achieved.

Abstract: Precise monitoring of etch depth and the thickness of insulating materials, such as Silicon dioxide and silicon nitride, is critical to ensuring device performance and yield in semiconductor manufacturing. While conventional ex-situ analysis methods are accurate, they are constrained by time delays and contamination risks. To address these limitations, this study proposes a non-contact, in-situ etch depth prediction framework based on machine learning (ML) techniques. Two scenarios are explored. In the first scenario, an artificial neural network (ANN) is trained to predict average etch depth from process parameters, achieving a significantly lower mean squared error (MSE) compared to a linear baseline model. The approach is then extended to incorporate variability from repeated measurements using a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Coverage analysis confirms the BNN's capability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates. In the second scenario, we demonstrate the feasibility of using RGB data from digital image colorimetry (DIC) as input for etch depth prediction, achieving strong performance even in the absence of explicit process parameters. These results suggest that the integration of DIC and ML offers a viable, cost-effective alternative for real-time, in-situ, and non-invasive monitoring in plasma etching processes, contributing to enhanced process stability, and manufacturing efficiency.

Abstract: Stress haunts people in modern society, which may cause severe health issues if left unattended. With social media becoming an integral part of daily life, leveraging social media to detect stress has gained increasing attention. While the majority of the work focuses on classifying stress states and stress categories, this study introduce a new task aimed at estimating more specific stressors (like exam, writing paper, etc.) through users' posts on social media. Unfortunately, the diversity of stressors with many different classes but a few examples per class, combined with the consistent arising of new stressors over time, hinders the machine understanding of stressors. To this end, we cast the stressor estimation problem within a practical scenario few-shot learning setting, and propose a novel meta-learning based stressor estimation framework that is enhanced by a meta-knowledge inheritance mechanism. This model can not only learn generic stressor context through meta-learning, but also has a good generalization ability to estimate new stressors with little labeled data. A fundamental breakthrough in our approach lies in the inclusion of the meta-knowledge inheritance mechanism, which equips our model with the ability to prevent catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new stressors. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with the baselines. Additionally, we construct a social media-based stressor estimation dataset that can help train artificial intelligence models to facilitate human well-being. The dataset is now public at \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xinwangcs/stressor-cause-of-mental-health-problem-dataset}{\underline{Kaggle}} and \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/XinWangcs/Stressor}{\underline{Hugging Face}}.

Abstract: E-commerce platforms generate vast volumes of user feedback, such as star ratings, written reviews, and comments. However, most recommendation engines rely primarily on numerical scores, often overlooking the nuanced opinions embedded in free text. This paper comprehensively reviews sentiment-aware recommendation systems from a natural language processing perspective, covering advancements from 2023 to early 2025. It highlights the benefits of integrating sentiment analysis into e-commerce recommenders to enhance prediction accuracy and explainability through detailed opinion extraction. Our survey categorizes recent work into four main approaches: deep learning classifiers that combine sentiment embeddings with user item interactions, transformer based methods for nuanced feature extraction, graph neural networks that propagate sentiment signals, and conversational recommenders that adapt in real time to user feedback. We summarize model architectures and demonstrate how sentiment flows through recommendation pipelines, impacting dialogue-based suggestions. Key challenges include handling noisy or sarcastic text, dynamic user preferences, and bias mitigation. Finally, we outline research gaps and provide a roadmap for developing smarter, fairer, and more user-centric recommendation tools.

Abstract: The widespread availability of video recording through smartphones and digital devices has made video-based evidence more accessible than ever. Surveillance footage plays a crucial role in security, law enforcement, and judicial processes. However, with the rise of advanced video editing tools, tampering with digital recordings has become increasingly easy, raising concerns about their authenticity. Ensuring the integrity of surveillance videos is essential, as manipulated footage can lead to misinformation and undermine judicial decisions. This paper provides a comprehensive review of existing forensic techniques used to detect video forgery, focusing on their effectiveness in verifying the authenticity of surveillance recordings. Various methods, including compression-based analysis, frame duplication detection, and machine learning-based approaches, are explored. The findings highlight the growing necessity for more robust forensic techniques to counteract evolving forgery methods. Strengthening video forensic capabilities will ensure that surveillance recordings remain credible and admissible as legal evidence.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have shown potential in analyzing digitized hand-drawn signals for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. However, the lack of clear interpretability in existing diagnostic methods presents a challenge to clinical trust. In this paper, we propose PointExplainer, an explainable diagnostic strategy to identify hand-drawn regions that drive model diagnosis. Specifically, PointExplainer assigns discrete attribution values to hand-drawn segments, explicitly quantifying their relative contributions to the model's decision. Its key components include: (i) a diagnosis module, which encodes hand-drawn signals into 3D point clouds to represent hand-drawn trajectories, and (ii) an explanation module, which trains an interpretable surrogate model to approximate the local behavior of the black-box diagnostic model. We also introduce consistency measures to further address the issue of faithfulness in explanations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and a newly constructed dataset show that PointExplainer can provide intuitive explanations with no diagnostic performance degradation.

Abstract: The adoption of open science has quickly changed how artificial intelligence (AI) policy research is distributed globally. This study examines the regional trends in the citation of preprints, specifically focusing on the impact of two major disruptive events: the COVID-19 pandemic and the release of ChatGPT, on research dissemination patterns in the United States, Europe, and South Korea from 2015 to 2024. Using bibliometrics data from the Web of Science, this study tracks how global disruptive events influenced the adoption of preprints in AI policy research and how such shifts vary by region. By marking the timing of these disruptive events, the analysis reveals that while all regions experienced growth in preprint citations, the magnitude and trajectory of change varied significantly. The United States exhibited sharp, event-driven increases; Europe demonstrated institutional growth; and South Korea maintained consistent, linear growth in preprint adoption. These findings suggest that global disruptions may have accelerated preprint adoption, but the extent and trajectory are shaped by local research cultures, policy environments, and levels of open science maturity. This paper emphasizes the need for future AI governance strategies to consider regional variability in research dissemination and highlights opportunities for further longitudinal and comparative research to deepen our understanding of open-access adoption in AI policy development.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscription (OBI) is the earliest systematic writing system in China, while the identification of Oracle Bone (OB) duplicates is a fundamental issue in OBI research. In this work, we design a progressive OB duplicate discovery framework that combines unsupervised low-level keypoints matching with high-level text-centric content-based matching to refine and rank the candidate OB duplicates with semantic awareness and interpretability. We compare our approach with state-of-the-art content-based image retrieval and image matching methods, showing that our approach yields comparable recall performance and the highest simplified mean reciprocal rank scores for both Top-5 and Top-15 retrieval results, and with significantly accelerated computation efficiency. We have discovered over 60 pairs of new OB duplicates in real-world deployment, which were missed by OBI researchers for decades.

Abstract: Biometric authentication has become one of the most widely used tools in the current technological era to authenticate users and to distinguish between genuine users and imposters. Face is the most common form of biometric modality that has proven effective. Deep learning-based face recognition systems are now commonly used across different domains. However, these systems usually operate like black-box models that do not provide necessary explanations or justifications for their decisions. This is a major disadvantage because users cannot trust such artificial intelligence-based biometric systems and may not feel comfortable using them when clear explanations or justifications are not provided. This paper addresses this problem by applying an efficient method for explainable face recognition systems. We use a Class Activation Mapping (CAM)-based discriminative localization (very narrow/specific localization) technique called Scaled Directed Divergence (SDD) to visually explain the results of deep learning-based face recognition systems. We perform fine localization of the face features relevant to the deep learning model for its prediction/decision. Our experiments show that the SDD Class Activation Map (CAM) highlights the relevant face features very specifically compared to the traditional CAM and very accurately. The provided visual explanations with narrow localization of relevant features can ensure much-needed transparency and trust for deep learning-based face recognition systems.

Abstract: Precise and effective processing of cardiac imaging data is critical for the identification and management of the cardiovascular diseases. We introduce IntelliCardiac, a comprehensive, web-based medical image processing platform for the automatic segmentation of 4D cardiac images and disease classification, utilizing an AI model trained on the publicly accessible ACDC dataset. The system, intended for patients, cardiologists, and healthcare professionals, offers an intuitive interface and uses deep learning models to identify essential heart structures and categorize cardiac diseases. The system supports analysis of both the right and left ventricles as well as myocardium, and then classifies patient's cardiac images into five diagnostic categories: dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, right ventricular abnormality, and no disease. IntelliCardiac combines a deep learning-based segmentation model with a two-step classification pipeline. The segmentation module gains an overall accuracy of 92.6\%. The classification module, trained on characteristics taken from segmented heart structures, achieves 98\% accuracy in five categories. These results exceed the performance of the existing state-of-the-art methods that integrate both segmentation and classification models. IntelliCardiac, which supports real-time visualization, workflow integration, and AI-assisted diagnostics, has great potential as a scalable, accurate tool for clinical decision assistance in cardiac imaging and diagnosis.

Abstract: Clustering bandits have gained significant attention in recommender systems by leveraging collaborative information from neighboring users to better capture target user preferences. However, these methods often lack a clear definition of similar users and face challenges when users with unique preferences lack appropriate neighbors. In such cases, relying on divergent preferences of misidentified neighbors can degrade recommendation quality. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive Collaborative Combinatorial Bandits algorithm (CoCoB). CoCoB employs an innovative two-sided bandit architecture, applying bandit principles to both the user and item sides. The user-bandit employs an enhanced Bayesian model to explore user similarity, identifying neighbors based on a similarity probability threshold. The item-bandit treats items as arms, generating diverse recommendations informed by the user-bandit's output. CoCoB dynamically adapts, leveraging neighbor preferences when available or focusing solely on the target user otherwise. Regret analysis under a linear contextual bandit setting and experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate CoCoB's effectiveness, achieving an average 2.4% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The availability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery has increased considerably in recent years, with datasets commercially available. However, the acquisition of high-resolution SAR images in airborne configurations, remains costly and limited. Thus, the lack of open source, well-labeled, or easily exploitable SAR text-image datasets is a barrier to the use of existing foundation models in remote sensing applications. In this context, synthetic image generation is a promising solution to augment this scarce data, enabling a broader range of applications. Leveraging over 15 years of ONERA's extensive archival airborn data from acquisition campaigns, we created a comprehensive training dataset of 110 thousands SAR images to exploit a 3.5 billion parameters pre-trained latent diffusion model. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing spatial conditioning techniques within a foundation model to transform satellite SAR imagery into airborne SAR representations. Additionally, we demonstrate that our pipeline is effective for bridging the realism of simulated images generated by ONERA's physics-based simulator EMPRISE. Our method explores a key application of AI in advancing SAR imaging technology. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce this approach in the literature.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, manifesting with motor and non-motor symptoms. Depressive symptoms are prevalent in PD, affecting up to 45% of patients. They are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping motor features, such as hypomimia. This study explores deep learning (DL) models-ViViT, Video Swin Tiny, and 3D CNN-LSTM with attention layers-to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms, as detected by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), in PD patients through facial video analysis. The same parameters were assessed in a secondary analysis taking into account whether patients were one hour after (ON-medication state) or 12 hours without (OFF-medication state) dopaminergic medication. Using a dataset of 1,875 videos from 178 patients, the Video Swin Tiny model achieved the highest performance, with up to 94% accuracy and 93.7% F1-score in binary classification (presence of absence of depressive symptoms), and 87.1% accuracy with an 85.4% F1-score in multiclass tasks (absence or mild or severe depressive symptoms).

Abstract: Apparent personality analysis from short videos poses significant chal-lenges due to the complex interplay of visual, auditory, and textual cues. In this paper, we propose GAME, a Graph-Augmented Multimodal Encoder designed to robustly model and fuse multi-source features for automatic personality prediction. For the visual stream, we construct a facial graph and introduce a dual-branch Geo Two-Stream Network, which combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Convolutional Neural Net-works (CNNs) with attention mechanisms to capture both structural and appearance-based facial cues. Complementing this, global context and iden-tity features are extracted using pretrained ResNet18 and VGGFace back-bones. To capture temporal dynamics, frame-level features are processed by a BiGRU enhanced with temporal attention modules. Meanwhile, audio representations are derived from the VGGish network, and linguistic se-mantics are captured via the XLM-Roberta transformer. To achieve effective multimodal integration, we propose a Channel Attention-based Fusion module, followed by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regression head for predicting personality traits. Extensive experiments show that GAME con-sistently outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks, vali-dating its effectiveness and generalizability.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing generates vast amounts of image data, crucial for defect identification and yield optimization, yet often exceeds manual inspection capabilities. Traditional clustering techniques struggle with high-dimensional, unlabeled data, limiting their effectiveness in capturing nuanced patterns. This paper introduces an advanced clustering framework that integrates deep Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with self-supervised and transfer learning techniques, offering a novel approach to unsupervised image clustering. TDA captures intrinsic topological features, while self-supervised learning extracts meaningful representations from unlabeled data, reducing reliance on labeled datasets. Transfer learning enhances the framework's adaptability and scalability, allowing fine-tuning to new datasets without retraining from scratch. Validated on synthetic and open-source semiconductor image datasets, the framework successfully identifies clusters aligned with defect patterns and process variations. This study highlights the transformative potential of combining TDA, self-supervised learning, and transfer learning, providing a scalable solution for proactive process monitoring and quality control in semiconductor manufacturing and other domains with large-scale image datasets.

Abstract: As a safety-critical cyber-physical system, cybersecurity and related safety issues for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have been important research topics for a while. Among all the modules on AVs, perception is one of the most accessible attack surfaces, as drivers and AVs have no control over the outside environment. Most current work targeting perception security for AVs focuses on perception correctness. In this work, we propose an impact analysis based on inference time attacks for autonomous vehicles. We demonstrate in a simulation system that such inference time attacks can also threaten the safety of both the ego vehicle and other traffic participants.

Abstract: Predicting genetic perturbations enables the identification of potentially crucial genes prior to wet-lab experiments, significantly improving overall experimental efficiency. Since genes are the foundation of cellular life, building gene regulatory networks (GRN) is essential to understand and predict the effects of genetic perturbations. However, current methods fail to fully leverage gene-related information, and solely rely on simple evaluation metrics to construct coarse-grained GRN. More importantly, they ignore functional differences between biotypes, limiting the ability to capture potential gene interactions. In this work, we leverage pre-trained large language model and DNA sequence model to extract features from gene descriptions and DNA sequence data, respectively, which serve as the initialization for gene representations. Additionally, we introduce gene biotype information for the first time in genetic perturbation, simulating the distinct roles of genes with different biotypes in regulating cellular processes, while capturing implicit gene relationships through graph structure learning (GSL). We propose GRAPE, a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) that leverages gene representations initialized with features from descriptions and sequences, models the distinct roles of genes with different biotypes, and dynamically refines the GRN through GSL. The results on publicly available datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The ability to selectively attend to relevant stimuli while filtering out distractions is essential for agents that process complex, high-dimensional sensory input. This paper introduces a model of covert and overt visual attention through the framework of active inference, utilizing dynamic optimization of sensory precisions to minimize free-energy. The model determines visual sensory precisions based on both current environmental beliefs and sensory input, influencing attentional allocation in both covert and overt modalities. To test the effectiveness of the model, we analyze its behavior in the Posner cueing task and a simple target focus task using two-dimensional(2D) visual data. Reaction times are measured to investigate the interplay between exogenous and endogenous attention, as well as valid and invalid cueing. The results show that exogenous and valid cues generally lead to faster reaction times compared to endogenous and invalid cues. Furthermore, the model exhibits behavior similar to inhibition of return, where previously attended locations become suppressed after a specific cue-target onset asynchrony interval. Lastly, we investigate different aspects of overt attention and show that involuntary, reflexive saccades occur faster than intentional ones, but at the expense of adaptability.

Abstract: Advances in multimodal machine learning have made text-to-image (T2I) models increasingly accessible and popular. However, T2I models introduce risks such as the generation of non-consensual depictions of identifiable individuals, otherwise known as deepfakes. This paper presents an empirical study exploring the accessibility of deepfake model variants online. Through a metadata analysis of thousands of publicly downloadable model variants on two popular repositories, Hugging Face and Civitai, we demonstrate a huge rise in easily accessible deepfake models. Almost 35,000 examples of publicly downloadable deepfake model variants are identified, primarily hosted on Civitai. These deepfake models have been downloaded almost 15 million times since November 2022, with the models targeting a range of individuals from global celebrities to Instagram users with under 10,000 followers. Both Stable Diffusion and Flux models are used for the creation of deepfake models, with 96% of these targeting women and many signalling intent to generate non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII). Deepfake model variants are often created via the parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique known as low rank adaptation (LoRA), requiring as few as 20 images, 24GB VRAM, and 15 minutes of time, making this process widely accessible via consumer-grade computers. Despite these models violating the Terms of Service of hosting platforms, and regulation seeking to prevent dissemination, these results emphasise the pressing need for greater action to be taken against the creation of deepfakes and NCII.

<title>Data-Driven Falsification of Cyber-Physical Systems</title>

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are abundant in safety-critical domains such as healthcare, avionics, and autonomous vehicles. Formal verification of their operational safety is, therefore, of utmost importance. In this paper, we address the falsification problem, where the focus is on searching for an unsafe execution in the system instead of proving their absence. The contribution of this paper is a framework that (a) connects the falsification of CPS with the falsification of deep neural networks (DNNs) and (b) leverages the inherent interpretability of Decision Trees for faster falsification of CPS. This is achieved by: (1) building a surrogate model of the CPS under test, either as a DNN model or a Decision Tree, (2) application of various DNN falsification tools to falsify CPS, and (3) a novel falsification algorithm guided by the explanations of safety violations of the CPS model extracted from its Decision Tree surrogate. The proposed framework has the potential to exploit a repertoire of \emph{adversarial attack} algorithms designed to falsify robustness properties of DNNs, as well as state-of-the-art falsification algorithms for DNNs. Although the presented methodology is applicable to systems that can be executed/simulated in general, we demonstrate its effectiveness, particularly in CPS. We show that our framework, implemented as a tool \textsc{FlexiFal}, can detect hard-to-find counterexamples in CPS that have linear and non-linear dynamics. Decision tree-guided falsification shows promising results in efficiently finding multiple counterexamples in the ARCH-COMP 2024 falsification benchmarks~\cite{khandait2024arch}.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving towards multi-agent systems where numerous AI agents collaborate and interact with external tools. Two key open standards, Google's Agent to Agent (A2A) protocol for inter-agent communication and Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized tool access, promise to overcome the limitations of fragmented, custom integration approaches. While their potential synergy is significant, this paper argues that effectively integrating A2A and MCP presents unique, emergent challenges at their intersection, particularly concerning semantic interoperability between agent tasks and tool capabilities, the compounded security risks arising from combined discovery and execution, and the practical governance required for the envisioned "Agent Economy". This work provides a critical analysis, moving beyond a survey to evaluate the practical implications and inherent difficulties of combining these horizontal and vertical integration standards. We examine the benefits (e.g., specialization, scalability) while critically assessing their dependencies and trade-offs in an integrated context. We identify key challenges increased by the integration, including novel security vulnerabilities, privacy complexities, debugging difficulties across protocols, and the need for robust semantic negotiation mechanisms. In summary, A2A+MCP offers a vital architectural foundation, but fully realizing its potential requires substantial advancements to manage the complexities of their combined operation.

Abstract: Creative coding platforms like Scratch have democratized programming for children, yet translating imaginative ideas into functional code remains a significant hurdle for many young learners. While AI copilots assist adult programmers, few tools target children in block-based environments. Building on prior research \cite{druga_how_2021,druga2023ai, druga2023scratch}, we present Cognimates Scratch Copilot: an AI-powered assistant integrated into a Scratch-like environment, providing real-time support for ideation, code generation, debugging, and asset creation. This paper details the system architecture and findings from an exploratory qualitative evaluation with 18 international children (ages 7--12). Our analysis reveals how the AI Copilot supported key creative coding processes, particularly aiding ideation and debugging. Crucially, it also highlights how children actively negotiated the use of AI, demonstrating strong agency by adapting or rejecting suggestions to maintain creative control. Interactions surfaced design tensions between providing helpful scaffolding and fostering independent problem-solving, as well as learning opportunities arising from navigating AI limitations and errors. Findings indicate Cognimates Scratch Copilot's potential to enhance creative self-efficacy and engagement. Based on these insights, we propose initial design guidelines for AI coding assistants that prioritize youth agency and critical interaction alongside supportive scaffolding.

<title>Novel Extraction of Discriminative Fine-Grained Feature to Improve Retinal Vessel Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is a vital early detection method for several severe ocular diseases. Despite significant progress in retinal vessel segmentation with the advancement of Neural Networks, there are still challenges to overcome. Specifically, retinal vessel segmentation aims to predict the class label for every pixel within a fundus image, with a primary focus on intra-image discrimination, making it vital for models to extract more discriminative features. Nevertheless, existing methods primarily focus on minimizing the difference between the output from the decoder and the label, but ignore fully using feature-level fine-grained representations from the encoder. To address these issues, we propose a novel Attention U-shaped Kolmogorov-Arnold Network named AttUKAN along with a novel Label-guided Pixel-wise Contrastive Loss for retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we implement Attention Gates into Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to enhance model sensitivity by suppressing irrelevant feature activations and model interpretability by non-linear modeling of KAN blocks. Additionally, we also design a novel Label-guided Pixel-wise Contrastive Loss to supervise our proposed AttUKAN to extract more discriminative features by distinguishing between foreground vessel-pixel pairs and background pairs. Experiments are conducted across four public datasets including DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1, HRF and our private dataset. AttUKAN achieves F1 scores of 82.50%, 81.14%, 81.34%, 80.21% and 80.09%, along with MIoU scores of 70.24%, 68.64%, 68.59%, 67.21% and 66.94% in the above datasets, which are the highest compared to 11 networks for retinal vessel segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our AttUKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing retinal vessel segmentation methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/stevezs315/AttUKAN.

Abstract: Optimization problems with norm-bounding constraints arise in a variety of applications, including portfolio optimization, machine learning, and feature selection. A common approach to these problems involves relaxing the norm constraint via Lagrangian relaxation, transforming it into a regularization term in the objective function. A particularly challenging class includes the zero-norm function, which promotes sparsity in statistical parameter estimation. Most existing exact methods for solving these problems introduce binary variables and artificial bounds to reformulate them as higher-dimensional mixed-integer programs, solvable by standard solvers. Other exact approaches exploit specific structural properties of the objective, making them difficult to generalize across different problem types. Alternative methods employ nonconvex penalties with favorable statistical characteristics, but these are typically addressed using heuristic or local optimization techniques due to their structural complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based method to globally solve optimization problems involving generalized norm-bounding constraints. Our approach encompasses standard $\ell_p$-norms for $p \in [0, \infty)$ and nonconvex penalties such as SCAD and MCP. We leverage decision diagrams to construct strong convex relaxations directly in the original variable space, eliminating the need for auxiliary variables or artificial bounds. Integrated into a spatial branch-and-cut framework, our method guarantees convergence to the global optimum. We demonstrate its effectiveness through preliminary computational experiments on benchmark sparse linear regression problems involving complex nonconvex penalties, which are not tractable using existing global optimization techniques.

Abstract: Cloud security concerns have been greatly realized in recent years due to the increase of complicated threats in the computing world. Many traditional solutions do not work well in real-time to detect or prevent more complex threats. Artificial intelligence is today regarded as a revolution in determining a protection plan for cloud data architecture through machine learning, statistical visualization of computing infrastructure, and detection of security breaches followed by counteraction. These AI-enabled systems make work easier as more network activities are scrutinized, and any anomalous behavior that might be a precursor to a more serious breach is prevented. This paper examines ways AI can enhance cloud security by applying predictive analytics, behavior-based security threat detection, and AI-stirring encryption. It also outlines the problems of the previous security models and how AI overcomes them. For a similar reason, issues like data privacy, biases in the AI model, and regulatory compliance are also covered. So, AI improves the protection of cloud computing contexts; however, more efforts are needed in the subsequent phases to extend the technology's reliability, modularity, and ethical aspects. This means that AI can be blended with other new computing technologies, including blockchain, to improve security frameworks further. The paper discusses the current trends in securing cloud data architecture using AI and presents further research and application directions.

Abstract: Resource allocation in High Performance Computing (HPC) environments presents a complex and multifaceted challenge for job scheduling algorithms. Beyond the efficient allocation of system resources, schedulers must account for and optimize multiple performance metrics, including job wait time and system utilization. While traditional rule-based scheduling algorithms dominate the current deployments of HPC systems, the increasing heterogeneity and scale of those systems is expected to challenge the efficiency and flexibility of those algorithms in minimizing job wait time and maximizing utilization. Recent research efforts have focused on leveraging advancements in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to develop more adaptable and intelligent scheduling strategies. Recent RL-based scheduling approaches have explored a range of algorithms, from Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and more recently, hybrid methods that integrate Graph Neural Networks with RL techniques. However, a common limitation across these methods is their reliance on relatively small datasets, and these methods face scalability issues when using large datasets. This study introduces a novel RL-based scheduler utilizing the Decentralized Distributed Proximal Policy Optimization (DD-PPO) algorithm, which supports large-scale distributed training across multiple workers without requiring parameter synchronization at every step. By eliminating reliance on centralized updates to a shared policy, the DD-PPO scheduler enhances scalability, training efficiency, and sample utilization. The validation dataset leveraged over 11.5 million real HPC job traces for comparing DD-PPO performance between traditional and advanced scheduling approaches, and the experimental results demonstrate improved scheduling performance in comparison to both rule-based schedulers and existing RL-based scheduling algorithms.

Abstract: Recently, there has been an impetus for the application of cutting-edge data collection platforms such as drones mounted with camera sensors for infrastructure asset management. However, the sensor characteristics, proximity to the structure, hard-to-reach access, and environmental conditions often limit the resolution of the datasets. A few studies used super-resolution techniques to address the problem of low-resolution images. Nevertheless, these techniques were observed to increase computational cost and false alarms of distress detection due to the consideration of all the infrastructure images i.e., positive and negative distress classes. In order to address the pre-processing of false alarm and achieve efficient super-resolution, this study developed a framework consisting of convolutional neural network (CNN) and efficient sub-pixel convolutional neural network (ESPCNN). CNN accurately classified both the classes. ESPCNN, which is the lightweight super-resolution technique, generated high-resolution infrastructure image of positive distress obtained from CNN. The ESPCNN outperformed bicubic interpolation in all the evaluation metrics for super-resolution. Based on the performance metrics, the combination of CNN and ESPCNN was observed to be effective in preprocessing the infrastructure images with negative distress, reducing the computational cost and false alarms in the next step of super-resolution. The visual inspection showed that EPSCNN is able to capture crack propagation, complex geometry of even minor cracks. The proposed framework is expected to help the highway agencies in accurately performing distress detection and assist in efficient asset management practices.

Abstract: Recent proprietary models (e.g., o3) have begun to demonstrate strong multimodal reasoning capabilities. Yet, most existing open-source research concentrates on training text-only reasoning models, with evaluations limited to mainly mathematical and general-domain tasks. Therefore, it remains unclear how to effectively extend reasoning capabilities beyond text input and general domains. This paper explores a fundamental research question: Is reasoning generalizable across modalities and domains? Our findings support an affirmative answer: General-domain text-based post-training can enable such strong generalizable reasoning. Leveraging this finding, we introduce X-Reasoner, a vision-language model post-trained solely on general-domain text for generalizable reasoning, using a two-stage approach: an initial supervised fine-tuning phase with distilled long chain-of-thoughts, followed by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Experiments show that X-Reasoner successfully transfers reasoning capabilities to both multimodal and out-of-domain settings, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models trained with in-domain and multimodal data across various general and medical benchmarks (Figure 1). Additionally, we find that X-Reasoner's performance in specialized domains can be further enhanced through continued training on domain-specific text-only data. Building upon this, we introduce X-Reasoner-Med, a medical-specialized variant that achieves new state of the art on numerous text-only and multimodal medical benchmarks.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generative modeling. However, their sequential computation requirements lead to significant inference-time bottlenecks. In this work, we utilize the connection between DDPMs and Stochastic Localization to prove that, under an appropriate reparametrization, the increments of DDPM satisfy an exchangeability property. This general insight enables near-black-box adaptation of various performance optimization techniques from autoregressive models to the diffusion setting. To demonstrate this, we introduce \emph{Autospeculative Decoding} (ASD), an extension of the widely used speculative decoding algorithm to DDPMs that does not require any auxiliary draft models. Our theoretical analysis shows that ASD achieves a $\tilde{O} (K^{\frac{1}{3}})$ parallel runtime speedup over the $K$ step sequential DDPM. We also demonstrate that a practical implementation of autospeculative decoding accelerates DDPM inference significantly in various domains.

Abstract: Accurate determination of the performance of parallel GPU code typically requires execution-time profiling on target hardware -- an increasingly prohibitive step due to limited access to high-end GPUs. This paper explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can offer an alternative approach for GPU performance prediction without relying on hardware. We frame the problem as a roofline classification task: given the source code of a GPU kernel and the hardware specifications of a target GPU, can an LLM predict whether the GPU kernel is compute-bound or bandwidth-bound?
  For this study, we build a balanced dataset of 340 GPU kernels, obtained from HeCBench benchmark and written in CUDA and OpenMP, along with their ground-truth labels obtained via empirical GPU profiling. We evaluate LLMs across four scenarios: (1) with access to profiling data of the kernel source, (2) zero-shot with source code only, (3) few-shot with code and label pairs, and (4) fine-tuned on a small custom dataset.
  Our results show that state-of-the-art LLMs have a strong understanding of the Roofline model, achieving 100% classification accuracy when provided with explicit profiling data. We also find that reasoning-capable LLMs significantly outperform standard LLMs in zero- and few-shot settings, achieving up to 64% accuracy on GPU source codes, without profiling information. Lastly, we find that LLM fine-tuning will require much more data than what we currently have available.
  This work is among the first to use LLMs for source-level roofline performance prediction via classification, and illustrates their potential to guide optimization efforts when runtime profiling is infeasible. Our findings suggest that with better datasets and prompt strategies, LLMs could become practical tools for HPC performance analysis and performance portability.

Abstract: Humans excel in navigating diverse, complex environments with agile motor skills, exemplified by parkour practitioners performing dynamic maneuvers, such as climbing up walls and jumping across gaps. Reproducing these agile movements with simulated characters remains challenging, in part due to the scarcity of motion capture data for agile terrain traversal behaviors and the high cost of acquiring such data. In this work, we introduce PARC (Physics-based Augmentation with Reinforcement Learning for Character Controllers), a framework that leverages machine learning and physics-based simulation to iteratively augment motion datasets and expand the capabilities of terrain traversal controllers. PARC begins by training a motion generator on a small dataset consisting of core terrain traversal skills. The motion generator is then used to produce synthetic data for traversing new terrains. However, these generated motions often exhibit artifacts, such as incorrect contacts or discontinuities. To correct these artifacts, we train a physics-based tracking controller to imitate the motions in simulation. The corrected motions are then added to the dataset, which is used to continue training the motion generator in the next iteration. PARC's iterative process jointly expands the capabilities of the motion generator and tracker, creating agile and versatile models for interacting with complex environments. PARC provides an effective approach to develop controllers for agile terrain traversal, which bridges the gap between the scarcity of motion data and the need for versatile character controllers.

Abstract: This paper proposes MergeGuard, a novel methodology for mitigation of AI Trojan attacks. Trojan attacks on AI models cause inputs embedded with triggers to be misclassified to an adversary's target class, posing a significant threat to model usability trained by an untrusted third party. The core of MergeGuard is a new post-training methodology for linearizing and merging fully connected layers which we show simultaneously improves model generalizability and performance. Our Proof of Concept evaluation on Transformer models demonstrates that MergeGuard maintains model accuracy while decreasing trojan attack success rate, outperforming commonly used (post-training) Trojan mitigation by fine-tuning methodologies.

Abstract: Structured outputs are essential for large language models (LLMs) in critical applications like agents and information extraction. Despite their capabilities, LLMs often generate outputs that deviate from predefined schemas, significantly hampering reliable application development. We present SLOT (Structured LLM Output Transformer), a model-agnostic approach that transforms unstructured LLM outputs into precise structured formats. While existing solutions predominantly rely on constrained decoding techniques or are tightly coupled with specific models, SLOT employs a fine-tuned lightweight language model as a post-processing layer, achieving flexibility across various LLMs and schema specifications. We introduce a systematic pipeline for data curation and synthesis alongside a formal evaluation methodology that quantifies both schema accuracy and content fidelity. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned Mistral-7B model with constrained decoding achieves near perfect schema accuracy (99.5%) and content similarity (94.0%), outperforming Claude-3.5-Sonnet by substantial margins (+25 and +20 percentage points, respectively). Notably, even compact models like Llama-3.2-1B can match or exceed the structured output capabilities of much larger proprietary models when equipped with SLOT, enabling reliable structured generation in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) is expensive, especially for providers hosting many models, making cost reduction essential. The unique workload patterns of serving multiple LLMs (i.e., multi-LLM serving) create new opportunities and challenges for this task. The long-tail popularity of models and their long idle periods present opportunities to improve utilization through GPU sharing. However, existing GPU sharing systems lack the ability to adjust their resource allocation and sharing policies at runtime, making them ineffective at meeting latency service-level objectives (SLOs) under rapidly fluctuating workloads.
  This paper presents Prism, a multi-LLM serving system that unleashes the full potential of GPU sharing to achieve both cost efficiency and SLO attainment. At its core, Prism tackles a key limitation of existing systems$\unicode{x2014}$the lack of $\textit{cross-model memory coordination}$, which is essential for flexibly sharing GPU memory across models under dynamic workloads. Prism achieves this with two key designs. First, it supports on-demand memory allocation by dynamically mapping physical to virtual memory pages, allowing flexible memory redistribution among models that space- and time-share a GPU. Second, it improves memory efficiency through a two-level scheduling policy that dynamically adjusts sharing strategies based on models' runtime demands. Evaluations on real-world traces show that Prism achieves more than $2\times$ cost savings and $3.3\times$ SLO attainment compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Abstract: Biological neurons exhibit diverse temporal spike patterns, which are believed to support efficient, robust, and adaptive neural information processing. While models such as Izhikevich can replicate a wide range of these firing dynamics, their complexity poses challenges for directly integrating them into scalable spiking neural networks (SNN) training pipelines. In this work, we propose two probabilistically driven, input-level temporal spike transformations: Poisson-Burst and Delayed-Burst that introduce biologically inspired temporal variability directly into standard Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons. This enables scalable training and systematic evaluation of how spike timing dynamics affect privacy, generalization, and learning performance. Poisson-Burst modulates burst occurrence based on input intensity, while Delayed-Burst encodes input strength through burst onset timing. Through extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that Poisson-Burst maintains competitive accuracy and lower resource overhead while exhibiting enhanced privacy robustness against membership inference attacks, whereas Delayed-Burst provides stronger privacy protection at a modest accuracy trade-off. These findings highlight the potential of biologically grounded temporal spike dynamics in improving the privacy, generalization and biological plausibility of neuromorphic learning systems.

Abstract: Tool invocation is a crucial mechanism for extending the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and has recently garnered significant attention. It enables LLMs to solve complex problems through tool calls while accessing up-to-date world knowledge. However, existing work primarily focuses on the fundamental ability of LLMs to invoke tools for problem-solving, without considering personalized constraints in tool invocation. In this work, we introduce the concept of Personalized Tool Invocation and define two key tasks: Tool Preference and Profile-dependent Query. Tool Preference addresses user preferences when selecting among functionally similar tools, while Profile-dependent Query considers cases where a user query lacks certain tool parameters, requiring the model to infer them from the user profile. To tackle these challenges, we propose PTool, a data synthesis framework designed for personalized tool invocation. Additionally, we construct \textbf{PTBench}, the first benchmark for evaluating personalized tool invocation. We then fine-tune various open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework and providing valuable insights. Our benchmark is public at https://github.com/hyfshadow/PTBench.

<title>LLM-e Guess: Can LLMs Capabilities Advance Without Hardware Progress?</title>

Abstract: This paper examines whether large language model (LLM) capabilities can continue to advance without additional compute by analyzing the development and role of algorithms used in state-of-the-art LLMs. Motivated by regulatory efforts that have largely focused on restricting access to high-performance hardware, we ask: Can LLMs progress in a compute-constrained environment, and how do algorithmic innovations perform under such conditions?
  To address these questions, we introduce a novel classification framework that distinguishes between compute-dependent innovations -- which yield disproportionate benefits at high compute levels (e.g., the Transformer architecture and mixture-of-experts models) and compute-independent innovations, which improve efficiency across all compute scales (e.g., rotary positional encoding, FlashAttention, or layer normalization). We quantify these contributions using a metric called compute-equivalent gain (CEG), which estimates the additional compute that would be required to achieve similar improvements without these algorithmic advancements.
  To validate this framework, we conduct small-scale training experiments with a scaled-down GPT-2 model. Our results confirm that compute-independent advancements yield meaningful performance gains even in resource-constrained settings, with a CEG of up to $3.5\times$ over a baseline model. By contrast, compute-dependent advancements provided little benefit or even degraded performance at the small scale, reinforcing the importance of compute availability for certain algorithmic gains.

<title>Plexus: Taming Billion-edge Graphs with 3D Parallel GNN Training</title>

Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a potent class of neural networks capable of leveraging the connectivity and structure of real-world graphs to learn intricate properties and relationships between nodes. Many real-world graphs exceed the memory capacity of a GPU due to their sheer size, and using GNNs on them requires techniques such as mini-batch sampling to scale. However, this can lead to reduced accuracy in some cases, and sampling and data transfer from the CPU to the GPU can also slow down training. On the other hand, distributed full-graph training suffers from high communication overhead and load imbalance due to the irregular structure of graphs. We propose Plexus, a three-dimensional (3D) parallel approach for full-graph training that tackles these issues and scales to billion-edge graphs. Additionally, we introduce optimizations such as a permutation scheme for load balancing, and a performance model to predict the optimal 3D configuration. We evaluate Plexus on several graph datasets and show scaling results for up to 2048 GPUs on Perlmutter, which is 33% of the machine, and 2048 GCDs on Frontier. Plexus achieves unprecedented speedups of 2.3x-12.5x over existing methods and a reduction in the time to solution by 5.2-8.7x on Perlmutter and 7-54.2x on Frontier.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), represented by OpenAI's GPT series, has significantly impacted various domains such as natural language processing, software development, education, healthcare, finance, and scientific research. However, OpenAI APIs introduce unique challenges that differ from traditional APIs, such as the complexities of prompt engineering, token-based cost management, non-deterministic outputs, and operation as black boxes. To the best of our knowledge, the challenges developers encounter when using OpenAI APIs have not been explored in previous empirical studies. To fill this gap, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study by analyzing 2,874 OpenAI API-related discussions from the popular Q&amp;A forum Stack Overflow. We first examine the popularity and difficulty of these posts. After manually categorizing them into nine OpenAI API-related categories, we identify specific challenges associated with each category through topic modeling analysis. Based on our empirical findings, we finally propose actionable implications for developers, LLM vendors, and researchers.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to be an integral part of next-generation AI-native 6G networks. With the prevalence of AI, researchers have identified numerous use cases of AI in network security. However, there are almost nonexistent studies that analyze the suitability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in network security. To fill this gap, we examine the suitability of LLMs in network security, particularly with the case study of STRIDE threat modeling. We utilize four prompting techniques with five LLMs to perform STRIDE classification of 5G threats. From our evaluation results, we point out key findings and detailed insights along with the explanation of the possible underlying factors influencing the behavior of LLMs in the modeling of certain threats. The numerical results and the insights support the necessity for adjusting and fine-tuning LLMs for network security use cases.

<title>Bringing legal knowledge to the public by constructing a legal question bank using large-scale pre-trained language model</title>

Abstract: Access to legal information is fundamental to access to justice. Yet accessibility refers not only to making legal documents available to the public, but also rendering legal information comprehensible to them. A vexing problem in bringing legal information to the public is how to turn formal legal documents such as legislation and judgments, which are often highly technical, to easily navigable and comprehensible knowledge to those without legal education. In this study, we formulate a three-step approach for bringing legal knowledge to laypersons, tackling the issues of navigability and comprehensibility. First, we translate selected sections of the law into snippets (called CLIC-pages), each being a small piece of article that focuses on explaining certain technical legal concept in layperson's terms. Second, we construct a Legal Question Bank (LQB), which is a collection of legal questions whose answers can be found in the CLIC-pages. Third, we design an interactive CLIC Recommender (CRec). Given a user's verbal description of a legal situation that requires a legal solution, CRec interprets the user's input and shortlists questions from the question bank that are most likely relevant to the given legal situation and recommends their corresponding CLIC pages where relevant legal knowledge can be found. In this paper we focus on the technical aspects of creating an LQB. We show how large-scale pre-trained language models, such as GPT-3, can be used to generate legal questions. We compare machine-generated questions (MGQs) against human-composed questions (HCQs) and find that MGQs are more scalable, cost-effective, and more diversified, while HCQs are more precise. We also show a prototype of CRec and illustrate through an example how our 3-step approach effectively brings relevant legal knowledge to the public.

Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly and produce outstanding results in image generation tasks, yet their content safety checks remain vulnerable to prompt-based jailbreaks. Through preliminary testing on platforms such as ChatGPT, MetaAI, and Grok, we observed that even short, natural prompts could lead to the generation of compromising images ranging from realistic depictions of forged documents to manipulated images of public figures.
  We introduce Unmasking the Canvas (UTC Benchmark; UTCB), a dynamic and scalable benchmark dataset to evaluate LLM vulnerability in image generation. Our methodology combines structured prompt engineering, multilingual obfuscation (e.g., Zulu, Gaelic, Base64), and evaluation using Groq-hosted LLaMA-3. The pipeline supports both zero-shot and fallback prompting strategies, risk scoring, and automated tagging. All generations are stored with rich metadata and curated into Bronze (non-verified), Silver (LLM-aided verification), and Gold (manually verified) tiers. UTCB is designed to evolve over time with new data sources, prompt templates, and model behaviors.
  Warning: This paper includes visual examples of adversarial inputs designed to test model safety. All outputs have been redacted to ensure responsible disclosure.

Abstract: "Read the room" is a significant social reasoning capability in human daily life. Humans can infer others' mental states from subtle social cues. Previous social reasoning tasks and datasets lack complexity (e.g., simple scenes, basic interactions, incomplete mental state variables, single-step reasoning, etc.) and fall far short of the challenges present in real-life social interactions. In this paper, we contribute a valuable, high-quality, and comprehensive video dataset named R^3-VQA with precise and fine-grained annotations of social events and mental states (i.e., belief, intent, desire, and emotion) as well as corresponding social causal chains in complex social scenarios. Moreover, we include human-annotated and model-generated QAs. Our task R^3-VQA includes three aspects: Social Event Understanding, Mental State Estimation, and Social Causal Reasoning. As a benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate the social reasoning capabilities and consistencies of current state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs). Comprehensive experiments show that (i) LVLMs are still far from human-level consistent social reasoning in complex social scenarios; (ii) Theory of Mind (ToM) prompting can help LVLMs perform better on social reasoning tasks. We provide some of our dataset and codes in supplementary material and will release our full dataset and codes upon acceptance.

<title>TS-SNN: Temporal Shift Module for Spiking Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly recognized for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, positioning them as strong alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in neuromorphic computing applications. SNNs inherently process temporal information by leveraging the precise timing of spikes, but balancing temporal feature utilization with low energy consumption remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce Temporal Shift module for Spiking Neural Networks (TS-SNN), which incorporates a novel Temporal Shift (TS) module to integrate past, present, and future spike features within a single timestep via a simple yet effective shift operation. A residual combination method prevents information loss by integrating shifted and original features. The TS module is lightweight, requiring only one additional learnable parameter, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing architectures with minimal additional computational cost. TS-SNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like CIFAR-10 (96.72\%), CIFAR-100 (80.28\%), and ImageNet (70.61\%) with fewer timesteps, while maintaining low energy consumption. This work marks a significant step forward in developing efficient and accurate SNN architectures.

<title>On-Device LLM for Context-Aware Wi-Fi Roaming</title>

Abstract: Wireless roaming is a critical yet challenging task for maintaining seamless connectivity in dynamic mobile environments. Conventional threshold-based or heuristic schemes often fail, leading to either sticky or excessive handovers. We introduce the first cross-layer use of an on-device large language model (LLM): high-level reasoning in the application layer that issues real-time actions executed in the PHY/MAC stack. The LLM addresses two tasks: (i) context-aware AP selection, where structured prompts fuse environmental cues (e.g., location, time) to choose the best BSSID; and (ii) dynamic threshold adjustment, where the model adaptively decides when to roam. To satisfy the tight latency and resource budgets of edge hardware, we apply a suite of optimizations-chain-of-thought prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and quantization. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that our approach surpasses legacy heuristics and DRL baselines, achieving a strong balance between roaming stability and signal quality. These findings underscore the promise of application-layer LLM reasoning for lower-layer wireless control in future edge systems.

Abstract: Text recognition in natural images remains a challenging yet essential task, with broad applications spanning computer vision and natural language processing. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework that combines ResNet and Vision Transformer backbones with advanced methodologies, including Deformable Convolutions, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Conditional Random Fields (CRF). These innovations collectively enhance feature representation and improve Optical Character Recognition (OCR) performance. Specifically, the framework substitutes standard convolution layers in the third and fourth blocks with Deformable Convolutions, leverages adaptive dropout for regularization, and incorporates CRF for more refined sequence modeling. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets IC13, IC15, SVT, IIIT5K, SVTP, and CUTE80 validate the proposed method's efficacy, achieving notable accuracies: 97.32% on IC13, 58.26% on IC15, 88.10% on SVT, 74.13% on IIIT5K, 82.17% on SVTP, and 66.67% on CUTE80, resulting in an average accuracy of 77.77%. These results establish a new state-of-the-art for text recognition, demonstrating the robustness of the approach across diverse and challenging datasets.

Abstract: Generating high-quality 3D models from 2D sketches is a challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity and sparsity of sketch data. In this paper, we present S3D, a novel framework that converts simple hand-drawn sketches into detailed 3D models. Our method utilizes a U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture to convert sketches into face segmentation masks, which are then used to generate a 3D representation that can be rendered from novel views. To ensure robust consistency between the sketch domain and the 3D output, we introduce a novel style-alignment loss that aligns the U-Net bottleneck features with the initial encoder outputs of the 3D generation module, significantly enhancing reconstruction fidelity. To further enhance the network's robustness, we apply augmentation techniques to the sketch dataset. This streamlined framework demonstrates the effectiveness of S3D in generating high-quality 3D models from sketch inputs. The source code for this project is publicly available at https://github.com/hailsong/S3D.

Abstract: We present VideoPath-LLaVA, the first large multimodal model (LMM) in computational pathology that integrates three distinct image scenarios, single patch images, automatically keyframe-extracted clips, and manually segmented video pathology images, to mimic the natural diagnostic process of pathologists. By generating detailed histological descriptions and culminating in a definitive sign-out diagnosis, VideoPath-LLaVA bridges visual narratives with diagnostic reasoning.
  Central to our approach is the VideoPath-Instruct dataset, comprising 4278 video and diagnosis-specific chain-of-thought instructional pairs sourced from educational histopathology videos on YouTube. Although high-quality data is critical for enhancing diagnostic reasoning, its creation is time-intensive and limited in volume. To overcome this challenge, we transfer knowledge from existing single-image instruction datasets to train on weakly annotated, keyframe-extracted clips, followed by fine-tuning on manually segmented videos. VideoPath-LLaVA establishes a new benchmark in pathology video analysis and offers a promising foundation for future AI systems that support clinical decision-making through integrated visual and diagnostic reasoning. Our code, data, and model are publicly available at https://github.com/trinhvg/VideoPath-LLaVA.

<title>An Enhanced YOLOv8 Model for Real-Time and Accurate Pothole Detection and Measurement</title>

Abstract: Potholes cause vehicle damage and traffic accidents, creating serious safety and economic problems. Therefore, early and accurate detection of potholes is crucial. Existing detection methods are usually only based on 2D RGB images and cannot accurately analyze the physical characteristics of potholes. In this paper, a publicly available dataset of RGB-D images (PothRGBD) is created and an improved YOLOv8-based model is proposed for both pothole detection and pothole physical features analysis. The Intel RealSense D415 depth camera was used to collect RGB and depth data from the road surfaces, resulting in a PothRGBD dataset of 1000 images. The data was labeled in YOLO format suitable for segmentation. A novel YOLO model is proposed based on the YOLOv8n-seg architecture, which is structurally improved with Dynamic Snake Convolution (DSConv), Simple Attention Module (SimAM) and Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU). The proposed model segmented potholes with irregular edge structure more accurately, and performed perimeter and depth measurements on depth maps with high accuracy. The standard YOLOv8n-seg model achieved 91.9% precision, 85.2% recall and 91.9% mAP@50. With the proposed model, the values increased to 93.7%, 90.4% and 93.8% respectively. Thus, an improvement of 1.96% in precision, 6.13% in recall and 2.07% in mAP was achieved. The proposed model performs pothole detection as well as perimeter and depth measurement with high accuracy and is suitable for real-time applications due to its low model complexity. In this way, a lightweight and effective model that can be used in deep learning-based intelligent transportation solutions has been acquired.

Abstract: E-commerce sellers are recommended keyphrases based on their inventory on which they advertise to increase buyer engagement (clicks/sales). The relevance of advertiser keyphrases plays an important role in preventing the inundation of search systems with numerous irrelevant items that compete for attention in auctions, in addition to maintaining a healthy seller perception. In this work, we describe the shortcomings of training Advertiser keyphrase relevance filter models on click/sales/search relevance signals and the importance of aligning with human judgment, as sellers have the power to adopt or reject said keyphrase recommendations. In this study, we frame Advertiser keyphrase relevance as a complex interaction between 3 dynamical systems -- seller judgment, which influences seller adoption of our product, Advertising, which provides the keyphrases to bid on, and Search, who holds the auctions for the same keyphrases. This study discusses the practicalities of using human judgment via a case study at eBay Advertising and demonstrate that using LLM-as-a-judge en-masse as a scalable proxy for seller judgment to train our relevance models achieves a better harmony across the three systems -- provided that they are bound by a meticulous evaluation framework grounded in business metrics.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data locality. Although FedAvg pioneered synchronous rounds for global model averaging, slower devices can delay collective progress. Asynchronous FL (e.g., FedAsync) addresses stragglers by continuously integrating client updates, yet naive implementations risk client drift due to non-IID data and stale contributions. Some Blockchain-based FL approaches (e.g., BRAIN) employ robust weighting or scoring of updates to resist malicious or misaligned proposals. However, performance drops can still persist under severe data heterogeneity or high staleness, and synchronization overhead has emerged as a new concern due to its aggregator-free architectures.
  We introduce Fast-and-Reliable AI Network, FRAIN, a new asynchronous FL method that mitigates these limitations by incorporating two key ideas. First, our FastSync strategy eliminates the need to replay past model versions, enabling newcomers and infrequent participants to efficiently approximate the global model. Second, we adopt spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) when merging parameters, preserving models' directions and alleviating destructive interference from divergent local training.
  Experiments with a CNN image-classification model and a Transformer-based language model demonstrate that FRAIN achieves more stable and robust convergence than FedAvg, FedAsync, and BRAIN, especially under harsh environments: non-IID data distributions, networks that experience delays and require frequent re-synchronization, and the presence of malicious nodes.

Abstract: Multi-agent autonomous systems (MAS) are better at addressing challenges that spans across multiple domains than singular autonomous agents. This holds true within the field of software engineering (SE) as well. The state-of-the-art research on MAS within SE focuses on integrating LLMs at the core of autonomous agents to create LLM-based multi-agent autonomous (LMA) systems. However, the introduction of LMA systems into SE brings a plethora of challenges. One of the major challenges is the strategic allocation of tasks between humans and the LMA system in a trustworthy manner. To address this challenge, a RACI-based framework is proposed in this work in progress article, along with implementation guidelines and an example implementation of the framework. The proposed framework can facilitate efficient collaboration, ensure accountability, and mitigate potential risks associated with LLM-driven automation while aligning with the Trustworthy AI guidelines. The future steps for this work delineating the planned empirical validation method are also presented.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) improve in their capacity to serve as personal AI assistants, their ability to output uniquely tailored, personalized responses that align with the soft preferences of their users is essential for enhancing user satisfaction and retention. However, untrained lay users have poor prompt specification abilities and often struggle with conveying their latent preferences to AI assistants. To address this, we leverage activation steering to guide LLMs to align with interpretable preference dimensions during inference. In contrast to memory-based personalization methods that require longer user history, steering is extremely lightweight and can be easily controlled by the user via an linear strength factor. We embed steering into three different interactive chatbot interfaces and conduct a within-subjects user study (n=14) to investigate how end users prefer to personalize their conversations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of preference-based steering for aligning real-world conversations with hidden user preferences, and highlight further insights on how diverse values around control, usability, and transparency lead users to prefer different interfaces.

Abstract: This, with the ever-increasing sophistication of cyberwar, calls for novel solutions. In this regard, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a highly promising tool for defensive and offensive cybersecurity-related strategies. While existing literature has focused much on the defensive use of LLMs, when it comes to their offensive utilization, very little has been reported-namely, concerning Vulnerability Assessment (VA) report validation. Consequentially, this paper tries to fill that gap by investigating the capabilities of LLMs in automating and improving the validation process of the report of the VA. From the critical review of the related literature, this paper hereby proposes a new approach to using the LLMs in the automation of the analysis and within the validation process of the report of the VA that could potentially reduce the number of false positives and generally enhance efficiency. These results are promising for LLM automatization for improving validation on reports coming from VA in order to improve accuracy while reducing human effort and security postures. The contribution of this paper provides further evidence about the offensive and defensive LLM capabilities and therefor helps in devising more appropriate cybersecurity strategies and tools accordingly.

Abstract: Egocentric video grounding is a crucial task for embodied intelligence applications, distinct from exocentric video moment localization. Existing methods primarily focus on the distributional differences between egocentric and exocentric videos but often neglect key characteristics of egocentric videos and the fine-grained information emphasized by question-type queries. To address these limitations, we propose OSGNet, an Object-Shot enhanced Grounding Network for egocentric video. Specifically, we extract object information from videos to enrich video representation, particularly for objects highlighted in the textual query but not directly captured in the video features. Additionally, we analyze the frequent shot movements inherent to egocentric videos, leveraging these features to extract the wearer's attention information, which enhances the model's ability to perform modality alignment. Experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that OSGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

<title>Non-stationary Diffusion For Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Due to the dynamics of underlying physics and external influences, the uncertainty of time series often varies over time. However, existing Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) often fail to capture this non-stationary nature, constrained by their constant variance assumption from the additive noise model (ANM). In this paper, we innovatively utilize the Location-Scale Noise Model (LSNM) to relax the fixed uncertainty assumption of ANM. A diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework, termed Non-stationary Diffusion (NsDiff), is designed based on LSNM that is capable of modeling the changing pattern of uncertainty. Specifically, NsDiff combines a denoising diffusion-based conditional generative model with a pre-trained conditional mean and variance estimator, enabling adaptive endpoint distribution modeling. Furthermore, we propose an uncertainty-aware noise schedule, which dynamically adjusts the noise levels to accurately reflect the data uncertainty at each step and integrates the time-varying variances into the diffusion process. Extensive experiments conducted on nine real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of NsDiff compared to existing approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/wwy155/NsDiff.

<title>GASCADE: Grouped Summarization of Adverse Drug Event for Enhanced Cancer Pharmacovigilance</title>

Abstract: In the realm of cancer treatment, summarizing adverse drug events (ADEs) reported by patients using prescribed drugs is crucial for enhancing pharmacovigilance practices and improving drug-related decision-making. While the volume and complexity of pharmacovigilance data have increased, existing research in this field has predominantly focused on general diseases rather than specifically addressing cancer. This work introduces the task of grouped summarization of adverse drug events reported by multiple patients using the same drug for cancer treatment. To address the challenge of limited resources in cancer pharmacovigilance, we present the MultiLabeled Cancer Adverse Drug Reaction and Summarization (MCADRS) dataset. This dataset includes pharmacovigilance posts detailing patient concerns regarding drug efficacy and adverse effects, along with extracted labels for drug names, adverse drug events, severity, and adversity of reactions, as well as summaries of ADEs for each drug. Additionally, we propose the Grouping and Abstractive Summarization of Cancer Adverse Drug events (GASCADE) framework, a novel pipeline that combines the information extraction capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the summarization power of the encoder-decoder T5 model. Our work is the first to apply alignment techniques, including advanced algorithms like Direct Preference Optimization, to encoder-decoder models using synthetic datasets for summarization tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of GASCADE across various metrics, validated through both automated assessments and human evaluations. This multitasking approach enhances drug-related decision-making and fosters a deeper understanding of patient concerns, paving the way for advancements in personalized and responsive cancer care. The code and dataset used in this work are publicly available.

<title>Sparsity is All You Need: Rethinking Biological Pathway-Informed Approaches in Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Biologically-informed neural networks typically leverage pathway annotations to enhance performance in biomedical applications. We hypothesized that the benefits of pathway integration does not arise from its biological relevance, but rather from the sparsity it introduces. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of all relevant pathway-based neural network models for predictive tasks, critically evaluating each study's contributions. From this review, we curated a subset of methods for which the source code was publicly available. The comparison of the biologically informed state-of-the-art deep learning models and their randomized counterparts showed that models based on randomized information performed equally well as biologically informed ones across different metrics and datasets. Notably, in 3 out of the 15 analyzed models, the randomized versions even outperformed their biologically informed counterparts. Moreover, pathway-informed models did not show any clear advantage in interpretability, as randomized models were still able to identify relevant disease biomarkers despite lacking explicit pathway information. Our findings suggest that pathway annotations may be too noisy or inadequately explored by current methods. Therefore, we propose a methodology that can be applied to different domains and can serve as a robust benchmark for systematically comparing novel pathway-informed models against their randomized counterparts. This approach enables researchers to rigorously determine whether observed performance improvements can be attributed to biological insights.

<title>Detecting Concept Drift in Neural Networks Using Chi-squared Goodness of Fit Testing</title>

Abstract: As the adoption of deep learning models has grown beyond human capacity for verification, meta-algorithms are needed to ensure reliable model inference. Concept drift detection is a field dedicated to identifying statistical shifts that is underutilized in monitoring neural networks that may encounter inference data with distributional characteristics diverging from their training data. Given the wide variety of model architectures, applications, and datasets, it is important that concept drift detection algorithms are adaptable to different inference scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an application of the $\chi^2$ Goodness of Fit Hypothesis Test as a drift detection meta-algorithm applied to a multilayer perceptron, a convolutional neural network, and a transformer trained for machine vision as they are exposed to simulated drift during inference. To that end, we demonstrate how unexpected drops in accuracy due to concept drift can be detected without directly examining the inference outputs. Our approach enhances safety by ensuring models are continually evaluated for reliability across varying conditions.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HeteGNNs) have demonstrated strong abilities to learn node representations by effectively extracting complex structural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs. Most of the prevailing HeteGNNs follow the neighborhood aggregation paradigm, leveraging meta-path based message passing to learn latent node representations. However, due to the pairwise nature of meta-paths, these models fail to capture high-order relations among nodes, resulting in suboptimal performance. Additionally, the challenge of ``over-squashing'', where long-range message passing in HeteGNNs leads to severe information distortion, further limits the efficacy of these models. To address these limitations, this paper proposes MGA-HHN, a Multi-Granular Attention based Heterogeneous Hypergraph Neural Network for heterogeneous graph representation learning. MGA-HHN introduces two key innovations: (1) a novel approach for constructing meta-path based heterogeneous hypergraphs that explicitly models higher-order semantic information in heterogeneous graphs through multiple views, and (2) a multi-granular attention mechanism that operates at both the node and hyperedge levels. This mechanism enables the model to capture fine-grained interactions among nodes sharing the same semantic context within a hyperedge type, while preserving the diversity of semantics across different hyperedge types. As such, MGA-HHN effectively mitigates long-range message distortion and generates more expressive node representations. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MGA-HHN outperforms state-of-the-art models, showcasing its effectiveness in node classification, node clustering and visualization tasks.

<title>Optimization Problem Solving Can Transition to Evolutionary Agentic Workflows</title>

Abstract: This position paper argues that optimization problem solving can transition from expert-dependent to evolutionary agentic workflows. Traditional optimization practices rely on human specialists for problem formulation, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning, creating bottlenecks that impede industrial adoption of cutting-edge methods. We contend that an evolutionary agentic workflow, powered by foundation models and evolutionary search, can autonomously navigate the optimization space, comprising problem, formulation, algorithm, and hyperparameter spaces. Through case studies in cloud resource scheduling and ADMM parameter adaptation, we demonstrate how this approach can bridge the gap between academic innovation and industrial implementation. Our position challenges the status quo of human-centric optimization workflows and advocates for a more scalable, adaptive approach to solving real-world optimization problems.

<title>Balancing Accuracy, Calibration, and Efficiency in Active Learning with Vision Transformers Under Label Noise</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.04375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained convolutional neural networks on ImageNet for downstream tasks is well-established. Still, the impact of model size on the performance of vision transformers in similar scenarios, particularly under label noise, remains largely unexplored. Given the utility and versatility of transformer architectures, this study investigates their practicality under low-budget constraints and noisy labels. We explore how classification accuracy and calibration are affected by symmetric label noise in active learning settings, evaluating four vision transformer configurations (Base and Large with 16x16 and 32x32 patch sizes) and three Swin Transformer configurations (Tiny, Small, and Base) on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, under varying label noise rates. Our findings show that larger ViT models (ViTl32 in particular) consistently outperform their smaller counterparts in both accuracy and calibration, even under moderate to high label noise, while Swin Transformers exhibit weaker robustness across all noise levels. We find that smaller patch sizes do not always lead to better performance, as ViTl16 performs consistently worse than ViTl32 while incurring a higher computational cost. We also find that information-based Active Learning strategies only provide meaningful accuracy improvements at moderate label noise rates, but they result in poorer calibration compared to models trained on randomly acquired labels, especially at high label noise rates. We hope these insights provide actionable guidance for practitioners looking to deploy vision transformers in resource-constrained environments, where balancing model complexity, label noise, and compute efficiency is critical in model fine-tuning or distillation.

Abstract: Transportation systems have long been shaped by complexity and heterogeneity, driven by the interdependency of agent actions and traffic outcomes. The deployment of automated vehicles (AVs) in such systems introduces a new challenge: achieving consensus across safety, interaction quality, and traffic performance. In this work, we position consensus as a fundamental property of the traffic system and aim to quantify it. We use high-resolution trajectory data from the Third Generation Simulation (TGSIM) dataset to empirically analyze AV and human-driven vehicle (HDV) behavior at a signalized urban intersection and around vulnerable road users (VRUs). Key metrics, including Time-to-Collision (TTC), Post-Encroachment Time (PET), deceleration patterns, headways, and string stability, are evaluated across the three performance dimensions. Results show that full consensus across safety, interaction, and performance is rare, with only 1.63% of AV-VRU interaction frames meeting all three conditions. These findings highlight the need for AV models that explicitly balance multi-dimensional performance in mixed-traffic environments. Full reproducibility is supported via our open-source codebase on https://github.com/wissamkontar/Consensus-AV-Analysis.

Abstract: We propose a deep product-unit residual neural network (PURe) that integrates product units into residual blocks to improve the expressiveness and parameter efficiency of deep convolutional networks. Unlike standard summation neurons, product units enable multiplicative feature interactions, potentially offering a more powerful representation of complex patterns. PURe replaces conventional convolutional layers with 2D product units in the second layer of each residual block, eliminating nonlinear activation functions to preserve structural information. We validate PURe on three benchmark datasets. On Galaxy10 DECaLS, PURe34 achieves the highest test accuracy of 84.89%, surpassing the much deeper ResNet152, while converging nearly five times faster and demonstrating strong robustness to Poisson noise. On ImageNet, PURe architectures outperform standard ResNet models at similar depths, with PURe34 achieving a top-1 accuracy of 80.27% and top-5 accuracy of 95.78%, surpassing deeper ResNet variants (ResNet50, ResNet101) while utilizing significantly fewer parameters and computational resources. On CIFAR-10, PURe consistently outperforms ResNet variants across varying depths, with PURe272 reaching 95.01% test accuracy, comparable to ResNet1001 but at less than half the model size. These results demonstrate that PURe achieves a favorable balance between accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Compared to traditional residual networks, PURe not only achieves competitive classification performance with faster convergence and fewer parameters, but also demonstrates greater robustness to noise. Its effectiveness across diverse datasets highlights the potential of product-unit-based architectures for scalable and reliable deep learning in computer vision.

<title>In-Context Adaptation to Concept Drift for Learned Database Operations</title>

Abstract: Machine learning has demonstrated transformative potential for database operations, such as query optimization and in-database data analytics. However, dynamic database environments, characterized by frequent updates and evolving data distributions, introduce concept drift, which leads to performance degradation for learned models and limits their practical applicability. Addressing this challenge requires efficient frameworks capable of adapting to shifting concepts while minimizing the overhead of retraining or fine-tuning.
  In this paper, we propose FLAIR, an online adaptation framework that introduces a new paradigm called \textit{in-context adaptation} for learned database operations. FLAIR leverages the inherent property of data systems, i.e., immediate availability of execution results for predictions, to enable dynamic context construction. By formalizing adaptation as $f:(\mathbf{x} \,| \,\mathcal{C}_t) \to \mathbf{y}$, with $\mathcal{C}_t$ representing a dynamic context memory, FLAIR delivers predictions aligned with the current concept, eliminating the need for runtime parameter optimization. To achieve this, FLAIR integrates two key modules: a Task Featurization Module for encoding task-specific features into standardized representations, and a Dynamic Decision Engine, pre-trained via Bayesian meta-training, to adapt seamlessly using contextual information at runtime. Extensive experiments across key database tasks demonstrate that FLAIR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 5.2x faster adaptation and reducing error by 22.5% for cardinality estimation.

Abstract: Optical systems have been pivotal for energy-efficient computing, performing high-speed, parallel operations in low-loss carriers. While these predominantly analog optical accelerators bypass digitization to perform parallel floating-point computations, scaling optical hardware to map large-vector sizes for AI tasks remains challenging. Here, we overcome this limitation by unfolding scalar operations in time and introducing a photonic-heater-in-lightpath (PHIL) unit for all-optical temporal integration. Counterintuitively, we exploit a slow heat dissipation process to integrate optical signals modulated at 50 GHz bridging the speed gap between the widely applied thermo-optic effects and ultrafast photonics. This architecture supports optical end-to-end signal processing, eliminates inefficient electro-optical conversions, and enables both linear and nonlinear operations within a unified framework. Our results demonstrate a scalable path towards high-speed photonic computing through thermally driven integration.

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate the ability to solve various programming tasks, including code generation. Typically, the performance of LLMs is measured on benchmarks with small or medium-sized context windows of thousands of lines of code. At the same time, in real-world software projects, repositories can span up to millions of LoC. This paper closes this gap by contributing to the long context code generation benchmark (YABLoCo). The benchmark featured a test set of 215 functions selected from four large repositories with thousands of functions. The dataset contained metadata of functions, contexts of the functions with different levels of dependencies, docstrings, functions bodies, and call graphs for each repository. This paper presents three key aspects of the contribution. First, the benchmark aims at function body generation in large repositories in C and C++, two languages not covered by previous benchmarks. Second, the benchmark contains large repositories from 200K to 2,000K LoC. Third, we contribute a scalable evaluation pipeline for efficient computing of the target metrics and a tool for visual analysis of generated code. Overall, these three aspects allow for evaluating code generation in large repositories in C and C++.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained over extensive corpora risk memorizing sensitive, copyrighted, or toxic content. To address this, we propose OBLIVIATE, a robust unlearning framework that removes targeted data while preserving model utility. The framework follows a structured process: extracting target tokens, building retain sets, and fine-tuning with a tailored loss function comprising three components -- masking, distillation, and world fact. Using low-rank adapters (LoRA), it ensures efficiency without compromising unlearning quality. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets, including the Harry Potter series, WMDP, and TOFU, using a comprehensive suite of metrics: forget quality (new document-level memorization score), model utility, and fluency. Results demonstrate its effectiveness in resisting membership inference attacks, minimizing the impact on retained data, and maintaining robustness across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Ornamentations, embellishments, or microtonal inflections are essential to melodic expression across many musical traditions, adding depth, nuance, and emotional impact to performances. Recognizing ornamentations in singing voices is key to MIR, with potential applications in music pedagogy, singer identification, genre classification, and controlled singing voice generation. However, the lack of annotated datasets and specialized modeling approaches remains a major obstacle for progress in this research area. In this work, we introduce R\=aga Ornamentation Detection (ROD), a novel dataset comprising Indian classical music recordings curated by expert musicians. The dataset is annotated using a custom Human-in-the-Loop tool for six vocal ornaments marked as event-based labels. Using this dataset, we develop an ornamentation detection model based on deep time-series analysis, preserving ornament boundaries during the chunking of long audio recordings. We conduct experiments using different train-test configurations within the ROD dataset and also evaluate our approach on a separate, manually annotated dataset of Indian classical concert recordings. Our experimental results support the superior performance of our proposed approach over the baseline CRNN.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed Machine Learning (ML) setup, where a shared model is collaboratively trained by various clients using their local datasets while keeping the data private. Considering resource-constrained devices, FL clients often suffer from restricted transmission capacity. Aiming to enhance the system performance, the communication between clients and server needs to be diminished. Current FL strategies transmit a tremendous amount of data (model weights) within the FL process, which needs a high communication bandwidth. Considering resource constraints, increasing the number of clients and, consequently, the amount of data (model weights) can lead to a bottleneck. In this paper, we introduce the Federated Black Widow Optimization (FedBWO) technique to decrease the amount of transmitted data by transmitting only a performance score rather than the local model weights from clients. FedBWO employs the BWO algorithm to improve local model updates. The conducted experiments prove that FedBWO remarkably improves the performance of the global model and the communication efficiency of the overall system. According to the experimental outcomes, FedBWO enhances the global model accuracy by an average of 21% over FedAvg, and 12% over FedGWO. Furthermore, FedBWO dramatically decreases the communication cost compared to other methods.

Abstract: Automatic music transcription (AMT) is the problem of analyzing an audio recording of a musical piece and detecting notes that are being played. AMT is a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to polyphonic music. The goal of AMT is to produce a score representation of a music piece, by analyzing a sound signal containing multiple notes played simultaneously. In this work, we design a processing pipeline that can transform classical piano audio files in .wav format into a music score representation. The features from the audio signals are extracted using the constant-Q transform, and the resulting coefficients are used as an input to the convolutional neural network (CNN) model.

Abstract: Temporal interaction graphs (TIGs), defined by sequences of timestamped interaction events, have become ubiquitous in real-world applications due to their capability to model complex dynamic system behaviors. As a result, temporal interaction graph representation learning (TIGRL) has garnered significant attention in recent years. TIGRL aims to embed nodes in TIGs into low-dimensional representations that effectively preserve both structural and temporal information, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as classification, prediction, and clustering within constantly evolving data environments. In this paper, we begin by introducing the foundational concepts of TIGs and emphasize the critical role of temporal dependencies. We then propose a comprehensive taxonomy of state-of-the-art TIGRL methods, systematically categorizing them based on the types of information utilized during the learning process to address the unique challenges inherent to TIGs. To facilitate further research and practical applications, we curate the source of datasets and benchmarks, providing valuable resources for empirical investigations. Finally, we examine key open challenges and explore promising research directions in TIGRL, laying the groundwork for future advancements that have the potential to shape the evolution of this field.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of clustering models is a challenging task where the outcome depends on the definition of what constitutes a cluster. Due to this design, current existing metrics rarely handle multiple clustering models with diverse cluster definitions, nor do they comply with the integration of constraints when available. In this work, we take inspiration from consensus clustering and assume that a set of clustering models is able to uncover hidden structures in the data. We propose to construct a discriminative ordering through ensemble clustering based on the distance between the connectivity of a clustering model and the consensus matrix. We first validate the proposed method with synthetic scenarios, highlighting that the proposed score ranks the models that best match the consensus first. We then show that this simple ranking score significantly outperforms other scoring methods when comparing sets of different clustering algorithms that are not restricted to a fixed number of clusters and is compatible with clustering constraints.

<title>Spectral and Temporal Denoising for Differentially Private Optimization</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a differentially private optimization method that addresses the challenge of preserving performance in DP-SGD, where added noise typically degrades model utility. FFTKF integrates frequency-domain noise shaping with Kalman filtering to enhance gradient quality while preserving $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees. It employs a high-frequency shaping mask in the Fourier domain to concentrate differential privacy noise in less informative spectral components, preserving low-frequency gradient signals. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with finite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients. With a per-iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$, FFTKF demonstrates improved test accuracy over DP-SGD and DiSK across MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets using CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers. Theoretical analysis confirms that FFTKF maintains equivalent privacy guarantees while achieving a tighter privacy-utility trade-off through reduced noise and controlled bias.

<title>Efficient Flow Matching using Latent Variables</title>

Abstract: Flow matching models have shown great potential in image generation tasks among probabilistic generative models. Building upon the ideas of continuous normalizing flows, flow matching models generalize the transport path of the diffusion models from a simple prior distribution to the data. Most flow matching models in the literature do not explicitly model the underlying structure/manifold in the target data when learning the flow from a simple source distribution like the standard Gaussian. This leads to inefficient learning, especially for many high-dimensional real-world datasets, which often reside in a low-dimensional manifold. Existing strategies of incorporating manifolds, including data with underlying multi-modal distribution, often require expensive training and hence frequently lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we present \texttt{Latent-CFM}, which provides simplified training/inference strategies to incorporate multi-modal data structures using pretrained deep latent variable models. Through experiments on multi-modal synthetic data and widely used image benchmark datasets, we show that \texttt{Latent-CFM} exhibits improved generation quality with significantly less training ($\sim 50\%$ less in some cases) and computation than state-of-the-art flow matching models. Using a 2d Darcy flow dataset, we demonstrate that our approach generates more physically accurate samples than competitive approaches. In addition, through latent space analysis, we demonstrate that our approach can be used for conditional image generation conditioned on latent features.

<title>"I Can See Forever!": Evaluating Real-time VideoLLMs for Assisting Individuals with Visual Impairments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04488</link>

Abstract: The visually impaired population, especially the severely visually impaired, is currently large in scale, and daily activities pose significant challenges for them. Although many studies use large language and vision-language models to assist the blind, most focus on static content and fail to meet real-time perception needs in dynamic and complex environments, such as daily activities. To provide them with more effective intelligent assistance, it is imperative to incorporate advanced visual understanding technologies. Although real-time vision and speech interaction VideoLLMs demonstrate strong real-time visual understanding, no prior work has systematically evaluated their effectiveness in assisting visually impaired individuals. In this work, we conduct the first such evaluation. First, we construct a benchmark dataset (VisAssistDaily), covering three categories of assistive tasks for visually impaired individuals: Basic Skills, Home Life Tasks, and Social Life Tasks. The results show that GPT-4o achieves the highest task success rate. Next, we conduct a user study to evaluate the models in both closed-world and open-world scenarios, further exploring the practical challenges of applying VideoLLMs in assistive contexts. One key issue we identify is the difficulty current models face in perceiving potential hazards in dynamic environments. To address this, we build an environment-awareness dataset named SafeVid and introduce a polling mechanism that enables the model to proactively detect environmental risks. We hope this work provides valuable insights and inspiration for future research in this field.

Abstract: Model-based planning and execution systems offer a principled approach to building flexible autonomous robots that can perform diverse tasks by automatically combining a host of basic skills. This idea is almost as old as modern robotics. Yet, while diverse general-purpose reasoning architectures have been proposed since, general-purpose systems that are integrated with modern robotic platforms have emerged only recently, starting with the influential ROSPlan system. Since then, a growing number of model-based systems for robot task-level control have emerged. In this paper, we consider the diverse design choices and issues existing systems attempt to address, the different solutions proposed so far, and suggest avenues for future development.

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion is one of the most crucial tasks in the field of image fusion, aiming to generate fused images with clear structural information and high-quality texture features for high-level vision tasks. However, when faced with severe illumination degradation in visible images, the fusion results of existing image fusion methods often exhibit blurry and dim visual effects, posing major challenges for autonomous driving. To this end, a Darkness-Free network is proposed to handle Visible and infrared image disentanglement and fusion all at Once (DFVO), which employs a cascaded multi-task approach to replace the traditional two-stage cascaded training (enhancement and fusion), addressing the issue of information entropy loss caused by hierarchical data transmission. Specifically, we construct a latent-common feature extractor (LCFE) to obtain latent features for the cascaded tasks strategy. Firstly, a details-extraction module (DEM) is devised to acquire high-frequency semantic information. Secondly, we design a hyper cross-attention module (HCAM) to extract low-frequency information and preserve texture features from source images. Finally, a relevant loss function is designed to guide the holistic network learning, thereby achieving better image fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Particularly, DFVO can generate clearer, more informative, and more evenly illuminated fusion results in the dark environments, achieving best performance on the LLVIP dataset with 63.258 dB PSNR and 0.724 CC, providing more effective information for high-level vision tasks. Our code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/DaVin-Qi530/DFVO.

<title>Overcoming Data Scarcity in Generative Language Modelling for Low-Resource Languages: A Systematic Review</title>

Abstract: Generative language modelling has surged in popularity with the emergence of services such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini. While these models have demonstrated transformative potential in productivity and communication, they overwhelmingly cater to high-resource languages like English. This has amplified concerns over linguistic inequality in natural language processing (NLP). This paper presents the first systematic review focused specifically on strategies to address data scarcity in generative language modelling for low-resource languages (LRL). Drawing from 54 studies, we identify, categorise and evaluate technical approaches, including monolingual data augmentation, back-translation, multilingual training, and prompt engineering, across generative tasks. We also analyse trends in architecture choices, language family representation, and evaluation methods. Our findings highlight a strong reliance on transformer-based models, a concentration on a small subset of LRLs, and a lack of consistent evaluation across studies. We conclude with recommendations for extending these methods to a wider range of LRLs and outline open challenges in building equitable generative language systems. Ultimately, this review aims to support researchers and developers in building inclusive AI tools for underrepresented languages, a necessary step toward empowering LRL speakers and the preservation of linguistic diversity in a world increasingly shaped by large-scale language technologies.

Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework under a broad class of risk objectives, characterized by convex scoring functions. This class covers many common risk measures, such as variance, Expected Shortfall, entropic Value-at-Risk, and mean-risk utility. To resolve the time-inconsistency issue, we consider an augmented state space and an auxiliary variable and recast the problem as a two-state optimization problem. We propose a customized Actor-Critic algorithm and establish some theoretical approximation guarantees. A key theoretical contribution is that our results do not require the Markov decision process to be continuous. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary variable sampling method inspired by the alternating minimization algorithm, which is convergent under certain conditions. We validate our approach in simulation experiments with a financial application in statistical arbitrage trading, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm.

<title>Purity Law for Generalizable Neural TSP Solvers</title>

Abstract: Achieving generalization in neural approaches across different scales and distributions remains a significant challenge for the Traveling Salesman Problem~(TSP). A key obstacle is that neural networks often fail to learn robust principles for identifying universal patterns and deriving optimal solutions from diverse instances. In this paper, we first uncover Purity Law (PuLa), a fundamental structural principle for optimal TSP solutions, defining that edge prevalence grows exponentially with the sparsity of surrounding vertices. Statistically validated across diverse instances, PuLa reveals a consistent bias toward local sparsity in global optima. Building on this insight, we propose Purity Policy Optimization~(PUPO), a novel training paradigm that explicitly aligns characteristics of neural solutions with PuLa during the solution construction process to enhance generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PUPO can be seamlessly integrated with popular neural solvers, significantly enhancing their generalization performance without incurring additional computational overhead during inference.

arXiv:2505.04578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning transforms large language models while creating a vulnerability we experimentally verify: Our experiment shows that malicious RL fine-tuning dismantles safety guardrails with remarkable efficiency, requiring only 50 steps and minimal adversarial prompts, with harmful escalating from 0-2 to 7-9. This attack vector particularly threatens open-source models with parameter-level access. Existing defenses targeting supervised fine-tuning prove ineffective against RL's dynamic feedback mechanisms. We introduce Reward Neutralization, the first defense framework specifically designed against RL fine-tuning attacks, establishing concise rejection patterns that render malicious reward signals ineffective. Our approach trains models to produce minimal-information rejections that attackers cannot exploit, systematically neutralizing attempts to optimize toward harmful outputs. Experiments validate that our approach maintains low harmful scores (no greater than 2) after 200 attack steps, while standard models rapidly deteriorate. This work provides the first constructive proof that robust defense against increasingly accessible RL attacks is achievable, addressing a critical security gap for open-weight models.

Abstract: Humanity appears to be on course to soon develop AI systems that substantially outperform human experts in all cognitive domains and activities. We believe the default trajectory has a high likelihood of catastrophe, including human extinction. Risks come from failure to control powerful AI systems, misuse of AI by malicious rogue actors, war between great powers, and authoritarian lock-in. This research agenda has two aims: to describe the strategic landscape of AI development and to catalog important governance research questions. These questions, if answered, would provide important insight on how to successfully reduce catastrophic risks.
  We describe four high-level scenarios for the geopolitical response to advanced AI development, cataloging the research questions most relevant to each. Our favored scenario involves building the technical, legal, and institutional infrastructure required to internationally restrict dangerous AI development and deployment (which we refer to as an Off Switch), which leads into an internationally coordinated Halt on frontier AI activities at some point in the future. The second scenario we describe is a US National Project for AI, in which the US Government races to develop advanced AI systems and establish unilateral control over global AI development. We also describe two additional scenarios: a Light-Touch world similar to that of today and a Threat of Sabotage situation where countries use sabotage and deterrence to slow AI development.
  In our view, apart from the Off Switch and Halt scenario, all of these trajectories appear to carry an unacceptable risk of catastrophic harm. Urgent action is needed from the US National Security community and AI governance ecosystem to answer key research questions, build the capability to halt dangerous AI activities, and prepare for international AI agreements.

<title>WATCH: Weighted Adaptive Testing for Changepoint Hypotheses via Weighted-Conformal Martingales</title>

Abstract: Responsibly deploying artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) systems in high-stakes settings arguably requires not only proof of system reliability, but moreover continual, post-deployment monitoring to quickly detect and address any unsafe behavior. Statistical methods for nonparametric change-point detection -- especially the tools of conformal test martingales (CTMs) and anytime-valid inference -- offer promising approaches to this monitoring task. However, existing methods are restricted to monitoring limited hypothesis classes or ``alarm criteria,'' such as data shifts that violate certain exchangeability assumptions, or do not allow for online adaptation in response to shifts. In this paper, we expand the scope of these monitoring methods by proposing a weighted generalization of conformal test martingales (WCTMs), which lay a theoretical foundation for online monitoring for any unexpected changepoints in the data distribution while controlling false-alarms. For practical applications, we propose specific WCTM algorithms that accommodate online adaptation to mild covariate shifts (in the marginal input distribution) while raising alarms in response to more severe shifts, such as concept shifts (in the conditional label distribution) or extreme (out-of-support) covariate shifts that cannot be easily adapted to. On real-world datasets, we demonstrate improved performance relative to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: We introduce Audio-SDS, a generalization of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to text-conditioned audio diffusion models. While SDS was initially designed for text-to-3D generation using image diffusion, its core idea of distilling a powerful generative prior into a separate parametric representation extends to the audio domain. Leveraging a single pretrained model, Audio-SDS enables a broad range of tasks without requiring specialized datasets. In particular, we demonstrate how Audio-SDS can guide physically informed impact sound simulations, calibrate FM-synthesis parameters, and perform prompt-specified source separation. Our findings illustrate the versatility of distillation-based methods across modalities and establish a robust foundation for future work using generative priors in audio tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced perception across text, vision, and audio, yet they often struggle with structured cross-modal reasoning, particularly when integrating audio and visual signals. We introduce EchoInk-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances such reasoning in MLLMs. Built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni-7B foundation and optimized with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EchoInk-R1 tackles multiple-choice question answering over synchronized audio-image pairs. To enable this, we curate AVQA-R1-6K, a dataset pairing such audio-image inputs with multiple-choice questions derived from OmniInstruct-v1. EchoInk-R1-7B achieves 85.77% accuracy on the validation set, outperforming the base model, which scores 80.53%, using only 562 reinforcement learning steps. Beyond accuracy, EchoInk-R1 demonstrates reflective reasoning by revisiting initial interpretations and refining responses when facing ambiguous multimodal inputs. These results suggest that lightweight reinforcement learning fine-tuning enhances cross-modal reasoning in MLLMs. EchoInk-R1 is the first framework to unify audio, visual, and textual modalities for general open-world reasoning via reinforcement learning. Code and data are publicly released to facilitate further research.

Abstract: In this paper, several techniques for learning game state evaluation functions by reinforcement are proposed. The first is a generalization of tree bootstrapping (tree learning): it is adapted to the context of reinforcement learning without knowledge based on non-linear functions. With this technique, no information is lost during the reinforcement learning process. The second is a modification of minimax with unbounded depth extending the best sequences of actions to the terminal states. This modified search is intended to be used during the learning process. The third is to replace the classic gain of a game (+1 / -1) with a reinforcement heuristic. We study particular reinforcement heuristics such as: quick wins and slow defeats ; scoring ; mobility or presence. The four is a new action selection distribution. The conducted experiments suggest that these techniques improve the level of play. Finally, we apply these different techniques to design program-players to the game of Hex (size 11 and 13) surpassing the level of Mohex 3HNN with reinforcement learning from self-play without knowledge.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a post-hoc and local explainable AI method tailored for Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models. These models are essential to Knowledge Graph Completion yet criticized for their opaque, black-box nature. Despite their significant success in capturing the semantics of knowledge graphs through high-dimensional latent representations, their inherent complexity poses substantial challenges to explainability. While existing methods like Kelpie use resource-intensive perturbation to explain KGE models, our approach directly decodes the latent representations encoded by KGE models, leveraging the smoothness of the embeddings, which follows the principle that similar embeddings reflect similar behaviours within the Knowledge Graph, meaning that nodes are similarly embedded because their graph neighbourhood looks similar. This principle is commonly referred to as smoothness. By identifying symbolic structures, in the form of triples, within the subgraph neighborhoods of similarly embedded entities, our method identifies the statistical regularities on which the models rely and translates these insights into human-understandable symbolic rules and facts. This bridges the gap between the abstract representations of KGE models and their predictive outputs, offering clear, interpretable insights. Key contributions include a novel post-hoc and local explainable AI method for KGE models that provides immediate, faithful explanations without retraining, facilitating real-time application on large-scale knowledge graphs. The method's flexibility enables the generation of rule-based, instance-based, and analogy-based explanations, meeting diverse user needs. Extensive evaluations show the effectiveness of our approach in delivering faithful and well-localized explanations, enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of KGE models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, and their application in edge scenarios has attracted significant attention. However, sparse-activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which are well suited for edge scenarios, have received relatively little attention due to their high memory demands. Offload-based methods have been proposed to address this challenge, but they face difficulties with expert prediction. Inaccurate expert predictions can result in prolonged inference delays. To promote the application of MoE models in edge scenarios, we propose Fate, an offloading system designed for MoE models to enable efficient inference in resource-constrained environments. The key insight behind Fate is that gate inputs from adjacent layers can be effectively used for expert prefetching, achieving high prediction accuracy without additional GPU overhead. Furthermore, Fate employs a shallow-favoring expert caching strategy that increases the expert hit rate to 99\%. Additionally, Fate integrates tailored quantization strategies for cache optimization and IO efficiency. Experimental results show that, compared to Load on Demand and Expert Activation Path-based method, Fate achieves up to 4.5x and 1.9x speedups in prefill speed and up to 4.1x and 2.2x speedups in decoding speed, respectively, while maintaining inference quality. Moreover, Fate's performance improvements are scalable across different memory budgets.

Abstract: The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into transportation planning has the potential to revolutionize tasks such as demand forecasting, infrastructure design, policy evaluation, and traffic simulation. However, there is a critical need for a systematic framework to guide the adoption of GenAI in this interdisciplinary domain. In this survey, we, a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and transportation engineering, present the first comprehensive framework for leveraging GenAI in transportation planning. Specifically, we introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes existing applications and methodologies into two perspectives: transportation planning tasks and computational techniques. From the transportation planning perspective, we examine the role of GenAI in automating descriptive, predictive, generative, simulation, and explainable tasks to enhance mobility systems. From the computational perspective, we detail advancements in data preparation, domain-specific fine-tuning, and inference strategies, such as retrieval-augmented generation and zero-shot learning tailored to transportation applications. Additionally, we address critical challenges, including data scarcity, explainability, bias mitigation, and the development of domain-specific evaluation frameworks that align with transportation goals like sustainability, equity, and system efficiency. This survey aims to bridge the gap between traditional transportation planning methodologies and modern AI techniques, fostering collaboration and innovation. By addressing these challenges and opportunities, we seek to inspire future research that ensures ethical, equitable, and impactful use of generative AI in transportation planning.

Abstract: With a growing interest in understanding neural network prediction strategies, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) have emerged as a popular tool for modeling human-understandable concepts in the latent space. Commonly, CAVs are computed by leveraging linear classifiers optimizing the separability of latent representations of samples with and without a given concept. However, in this paper we show that such a separability-oriented computation leads to solutions, which may diverge from the actual goal of precisely modeling the concept direction. This discrepancy can be attributed to the significant influence of distractor directions, i.e., signals unrelated to the concept, which are picked up by filters (i.e., weights) of linear models to optimize class-separability. To address this, we introduce pattern-based CAVs, solely focussing on concept signals, thereby providing more accurate concept directions. We evaluate various CAV methods in terms of their alignment with the true concept direction and their impact on CAV applications, including concept sensitivity testing and model correction for shortcut behavior caused by data artifacts. We demonstrate the benefits of pattern-based CAVs using the Pediatric Bone Age, ISIC2019, and FunnyBirds datasets with VGG, ResNet, ReXNet, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformer as model architectures.

Abstract: Network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) monitors network traffic for malicious activities, forming the frontline defense against increasing attacks over information infrastructures. Although promising, our quantitative analysis shows that existing methods perform inconsistently in declaring various unknown attacks (e.g., 9% and 35% F1 respectively for two distinct unknown threats for an SVM-based method) or detecting diverse known attacks (e.g., 31% F1 for the Backdoor and 93% F1 for DDoS by a GCN-based state-of-the-art method), and reveals that the underlying cause is entangled distributions of flow features. This motivates us to propose 3D-IDS, a novel method that aims to tackle the above issues through two-step feature disentanglements and a dynamic graph diffusion scheme. Specifically, we first disentangle traffic features by a non-parameterized optimization based on mutual information, automatically differentiating tens and hundreds of complex features of various attacks. Such differentiated features will be fed into a memory model to generate representations, which are further disentangled to highlight the attack-specific features. Finally, we use a novel graph diffusion method that dynamically fuses the network topology for spatial-temporal aggregation in evolving data streams. By doing so, we can effectively identify various attacks in encrypted traffics, including unknown threats and known ones that are not easily detected. Experiments show the superiority of our 3D-IDS. We also demonstrate that our two-step feature disentanglements benefit the explainability of NIDS.

Abstract: Music generation has attracted growing interest with the advancement of deep generative models. However, generating music conditioned on textual descriptions, known as text-to-music, remains challenging due to the complexity of musical structures and high sampling rate requirements. Despite the task's significance, prevailing generative models exhibit limitations in music quality, computational efficiency, and generalization. This paper introduces JEN-1, a universal high-fidelity model for text-to-music generation. JEN-1 is a diffusion model incorporating both autoregressive and non-autoregressive training. Through in-context learning, JEN-1 performs various generation tasks including text-guided music generation, music inpainting, and continuation. Evaluations demonstrate JEN-1's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in text-music alignment and music quality while maintaining computational efficiency.

<title>Recursively Summarizing Enables Long-Term Dialogue Memory in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, stand out remarkable conversational abilities, enabling them to engage in dynamic and contextually relevant dialogues across a wide range of topics. However, given a long conversation, these chatbots fail to recall past information and tend to generate inconsistent responses. To address this, we propose to recursively generate summaries/ memory using large language models (LLMs) to enhance long-term memory ability. Specifically, our method first stimulates LLMs to memorize small dialogue contexts and then recursively produce new memory using previous memory and following contexts. Finally, the chatbot can easily generate a highly consistent response with the help of the latest memory. We evaluate our method on both open and closed LLMs, and the experiments on the widely-used public dataset show that our method can generate more consistent responses in a long-context conversation. Also, we show that our strategy could nicely complement both long-context (e.g., 8K and 16K) and retrieval-enhanced LLMs, bringing further long-term dialogue performance. Notably, our method is a potential solution to enable the LLM to model the extremely long context. The code and scripts will be released later.

Abstract: With the advent of modern AI architectures, a shift has happened towards end-to-end architectures. This pivot has led to neural architectures being trained without domain-specific biases/knowledge, optimized according to the task. We in this paper, learn audio embeddings via diverse feature representations, in this case, domain-specific. For the case of audio classification over hundreds of categories of sound, we learn robust separate embeddings for diverse audio properties such as pitch, timbre, and neural representation, along with also learning it via an end-to-end architecture. We observe handcrafted embeddings, e.g., pitch and timbre-based, although on their own, are not able to beat a fully end-to-end representation, yet adding these together with end-to-end embedding helps us, significantly improve performance. This work would pave the way to bring some domain expertise with end-to-end models to learn robust, diverse representations, surpassing the performance of just training end-to-end models.

Abstract: What does it take to build mobile manipulation systems that can competently operate on previously unseen objects in previously unseen environments? This work answers this question using opening of articulated structures as a mobile manipulation testbed. Specifically, our focus is on the end-to-end performance on this task without any privileged information, i.e. the robot starts at a location with the novel target articulated object in view, and has to approach the object and successfully open it. We first develop a system for this task, and then conduct 100+ end-to-end system tests across 13 real world test sites. Our large-scale study reveals a number of surprising findings: a) modular systems outperform end-to-end learned systems for this task, even when the end-to-end learned systems are trained on 1000+ demonstrations, b) perception, and not precise end-effector control, is the primary bottleneck to task success, and c) state-of-the-art articulation parameter estimation models developed in isolation struggle when faced with robot-centric viewpoints. Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of developing components of the pipeline in isolation and underscore the need for system-level research, providing a pragmatic roadmap for building generalizable mobile manipulation systems.

Abstract: Humans can often quickly and efficiently solve complex new learning tasks given only a small set of examples. In contrast, modern artificially intelligent systems often require thousands or millions of observations in order to solve even the most basic tasks. Meta-learning aims to resolve this issue by leveraging past experiences from similar learning tasks to embed the appropriate inductive biases into the learning system. Historically methods for meta-learning components such as optimizers, parameter initializations, and more have led to significant performance increases. This thesis aims to explore the concept of meta-learning to improve performance, through the often-overlooked component of the loss function. The loss function is a vital component of a learning system, as it represents the primary learning objective, where success is determined and quantified by the system's ability to optimize for that objective successfully.

Abstract: This paper presents question-answering on dense video events, a novel task that answers and grounds dense-event questions in long videos, thus challenging MLLMs to faithfully comprehend and reason about multiple events over extended periods of time. To facilitate the study, we construct DeVE-QA -- a dataset featuring 78K questions about 26K events on 10.6K long videos. Our benchmarking shows that state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle on DeVE-QA. For improvement, we propose DeVi, a novel training-free MLLM approach that highlights a hierarchical captioning module, a temporal event memory module, and a self-consistency checking module to respectively detect, contextualize and memorize, and ground dense-events in long videos for question answering. Extensive experiments show that DeVi is superior at answering dense-event questions and grounding relevant video moments. Compared with existing MLLMs, it achieves a remarkable increase of 4.8% and 2.1% for G(round)QA accuracy on DeVE-QA~and NExT-GQA, respectively. Our data and code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been successfully applied to a wide range of robotics applications for learning complex multi-modal behaviors from data. However, prior works have mostly been confined to single-robot and small-scale environments due to the high sample complexity of learning multi-robot diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a method for generating collision-free multi-robot trajectories that conform to underlying data distributions while using only single-robot data. Our algorithm, Multi-robot Multi-model planning Diffusion (MMD), does so by combining learned diffusion models with classical search-based techniques -- generating data-driven motions under collision constraints. Scaling further, we show how to compose multiple diffusion models to plan in large environments where a single diffusion model fails to generalize well. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning for dozens of robots in a variety of simulated scenarios motivated by logistics environments.

Abstract: We address an inverse problem in modeling holographic superconductors. We focus our research on the critical temperature behavior depicted by experiments. We use a physics-informed neural network method to find a mass function $M(F^2)$, which is necessary to understand phase transition behavior. This mass function describes a nonlinear interaction between superconducting order and charge carrier density. We introduce positional embedding layers to improve the learning process in our algorithm, and the Adam optimization is used to predict the critical temperature data via holographic calculation with appropriate accuracy. Consideration of the positional embedding layers is motivated by the transformer model of natural-language processing in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. We obtain holographic models that reproduce borderlines of the normal and superconducting phases provided by actual data. Our work is the first holographic attempt to match phase transition data quantitatively obtained from experiments. Also, the present work offers a new methodology for data-based holographic models.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered to have enormous potential in the future development of Artificial Intelligence due to their brain-inspired and energy-efficient properties. Compared to vanilla Spatial-Temporal Back-propagation (STBP) training methods, online training can effectively overcome the risk of GPU memory explosion. However, current online learning framework cannot tackle the inseparability problem of temporal dependent gradients and merely aim to optimize the training memory, resulting in no performance advantages compared to the STBP training models in the inference phase. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Hybrid Mechanism-Driven Firing (HM-DF) model, which is a family of advanced models that respectively adopt different spiking calculation schemes in the upper-region and lower-region of the firing threshold. We point out that HM-DF model can effectively separate temporal gradients and tackle the mismatch problem of surrogate gradients, as well as achieving full-stage optimization towards computation speed and memory footprint. Experimental results have demonstrated that HM-DF model can be flexibly combined with various techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the field of online learning, without triggering further power consumption.

<title>DeMuVGN: Effective Software Defect Prediction Model by Learning Multi-view Software Dependency via Graph Neural Networks</title>

arXiv:2410.19550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software defect prediction (SDP) aims to identify high-risk defect modules in software development, optimizing resource allocation. While previous studies show that dependency network metrics improve defect prediction, most methods focus on code-based dependency graphs, overlooking developer factors. Current metrics, based on handcrafted features like ego and global network metrics, fail to fully capture defect-related information. To address this, we propose DeMuVGN, a defect prediction model that learns multi-view software dependency via graph neural networks. We introduce a Multi-view Software Dependency Graph (MSDG) that integrates data, call, and developer dependencies. DeMuVGN also leverages the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance and enhance defect module identification. In a case study of eight open-source projects across 20 versions, DeMuVGN demonstrates significant improvements: i) models based on multi-view graphs improve F1 scores by 11.1% to 12.1% over single-view models; ii) DeMuVGN improves F1 scores by 17.4% to 45.8% in within-project contexts and by 17.9% to 41.0% in cross-project contexts. Additionally, DeMuVGN excels in software evolution, showing more improvement in later-stage software versions. Its strong performance across different projects highlights its generalizability. We recommend future research focus on multi-view dependency graphs for defect prediction in both mature and newly developed projects.

Abstract: In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable interest in the field of time series analysis, due to their ability to capture dependencies among variables and across time points. The objective of the presented systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and over 150 journal papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive collection of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of the results of current spatio-temporal GNN models in different domains. In addition, in its final part this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability.

Abstract: We introduce new high-resolution galaxy simulations accelerated by a surrogate model that reduces the computation cost by approximately 75 percent. Massive stars with a Zero Age Main Sequence mass of more than about 10 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which play a critical role in galaxy formation. The energy released by CCSNe is essential for regulating star formation and driving feedback processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the short integration timesteps required for SNe feedback have presented significant bottlenecks in astrophysical simulations across various scales. Overcoming this challenge is crucial for enabling star-by-star galaxy simulations, which aim to capture the dynamics of individual stars and the inhomogeneous shell's expansion within the turbulent ISM. To address this, our new framework combines direct numerical simulations and surrogate modeling, including machine learning and Gibbs sampling. The star formation history and the time evolution of outflow rates in the galaxy match those obtained from resolved direct numerical simulations. Our new approach achieves high-resolution fidelity while reducing computational costs, effectively bridging the physical scale gap and enabling multi-scale simulations.

Abstract: Electronic maps consist of diverse entities, such as points of interest (POIs), road networks, and land parcels, playing a vital role in applications like ITS and LBS. Map entity representation learning (MapRL) generates versatile and reusable data representations, providing essential tools for efficiently managing and utilizing map entity data. Despite the progress in MapRL, two key challenges constrain further development. First, existing research is fragmented, with models classified by the type of map entity, limiting the reusability of techniques across different tasks. Second, the lack of unified benchmarks makes systematic evaluation and comparison of models difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a novel taxonomy for MapRL that organizes models based on functional module-such as encoders, pre-training tasks, and downstream tasks-rather than by entity type. Building on this taxonomy, we present a taxonomy-driven library, VecCity, which offers easy-to-use interfaces for encoding, pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation. The library integrates datasets from nine cities and reproduces 21 mainstream MapRL models, establishing the first standardized benchmarks for the field. VecCity also allows users to modify and extend models through modular components, facilitating seamless experimentation. Our comprehensive experiments cover multiple types of map entities and evaluate 21 VecCity pre-built models across various downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of VecCity in streamlining model development and provide insights into the impact of various components on performance. By promoting modular design and reusability, VecCity offers a unified framework to advance research and innovation in MapRL. The code is available at https://github.com/Bigscity-VecCity/VecCity.

arXiv:2411.05261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in automated report generation, the opaqueness of text interpretability continues to cast doubt on the reliability of the content produced. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify specific image features in X-ray images that influence the outputs of report generation models. Specifically, we propose Cyclic Vision-Language Manipulator CVLM, a module to generate a manipulated X-ray from an original X-ray and its report from a designated report generator. The essence of CVLM is that cycling manipulated X-rays to the report generator produces altered reports aligned with the alterations pre-injected into the reports for X-ray generation, achieving the term "cyclic manipulation". This process allows direct comparison between original and manipulated X-rays, clarifying the critical image features driving changes in reports and enabling model users to assess the reliability of the generated texts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CVLM can identify more precise and reliable features compared to existing explanation methods, significantly enhancing the transparency and applicability of AI-generated reports.

Abstract: Accurate photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting is critical for integrating renewable energy sources into the grid, optimizing real-time energy management, and ensuring energy reliability amidst increasing demand. However, existing models often struggle with effectively capturing the complex relationships between target variables and covariates, as well as the interactions between temporal dynamics and multivariate data, leading to suboptimal forecasting accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model architecture that leverages the iTransformer for feature extraction from target variables and employs long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract features from covariates. A cross-attention mechanism is integrated to fuse the outputs of both models, followed by a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) mapping for enhanced representation. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated using publicly available datasets from Australia, with experiments conducted across four seasons. Results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively capture seasonal variations in PV power generation and improve forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Dynamic scenes contain intricate spatio-temporal information, crucial for mobile robots, UAVs, and autonomous driving systems to make informed decisions. Parsing these scenes into semantic triplets  for accurate Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is highly challenging due to the fluctuating spatio-temporal complexity. Inspired by the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose SceneLLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as powerful scene analyzers for dynamic SGG. Our framework introduces a Video-to-Language (V2L) mapping module that transforms video frames into linguistic signals (scene tokens), making the input more comprehensible for LLMs. To better encode spatial information, we devise a Spatial Information Aggregation (SIA) scheme, inspired by the structure of Chinese characters, which encodes spatial data into tokens. Using Optimal Transport (OT), we generate an implicit language signal from the frame-level token sequence that captures the video's spatio-temporal information. To further improve the LLM's ability to process this implicit linguistic input, we apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model. Finally, we use a transformer-based SGG predictor to decode the LLM's reasoning and predict semantic triplets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Action Genome (AG) benchmark, and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of SceneLLM in understanding and generating accurate dynamic scene graphs.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly popular across various visual tasks, and several open-sourced VLM variants have been released. However, selecting the best-performing pre-trained VLM for a specific downstream task is challenging since no single VLM can achieve promising performance on all downstream tasks, and evaluating all available VLMs is impossible due to time and data limitations. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel paradigm to select and reuse VLM for downstream tasks, called Model Label Learning (MLL). The proposal contains three key modules: \emph{model labeling}, which assigns labels to each VLM to describe their specialty and utility; \emph{model selection}, which matches the requirements of the target task with model labels; and \emph{model reuse}, which applies selected VLMs to the target task in an ensemble manner. The proposal is highly computationally efficient and growable since the model labeling process is completed target task independent and the ability could grow with the number of candidate VLMs. We also introduce a new benchmark for evaluating VLM selection methods, including 49 VLMs and 17 target task datasets. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for selecting and reusing VLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) image recognition is a powerful tool for extracting data from images, but accuracy depends on providing sufficient cues in the prompt - requiring a domain expert for specialized tasks. We introduce Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition (CLEAR), which uses a combination of LLMs and evolutionary computation to generate and optimize cues such that recognition of specialized features in images is improved. It achieves this by auto-generating a novel domain-specific representation and then using it to optimize suitable textual cues with a genetic algorithm. We apply CLEAR to the real-world task of identifying sustainability data from interior and exterior images of buildings. We investigate the effects of using a variable-length representation compared to fixed-length and show how LLM consistency can be improved by refactoring from categorical to real-valued estimates. We show that CLEAR enables higher accuracy compared to expert human recognition and human-authored prompts in every task with error rates improved by up to two orders of magnitude and an ablation study evincing solution concision.

Abstract: Sustainable agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring world food security for consumers. A critical challenge faced by sustainable precision agriculture is weed growth, as weeds compete for essential resources with crops, such as water, soil nutrients, and sunlight, which notably affect crop yields. The adoption of automated computer vision technologies and ground agricultural consumer electronic vehicles in precision agriculture offers sustainable, low-carbon solutions. However, prior works suffer from issues such as low accuracy and precision, as well as high computational expense. This work proposes EcoWeedNet, a novel model that enhances weed detection performance without introducing significant computational complexity, aligning with the goals of low-carbon agricultural practices. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on the CottonWeedDet12 benchmark dataset, which reflects real-world scenarios. EcoWeedNet achieves performance comparable to that of large models (mAP@0.5 = 95.2%), yet with significantly fewer parameters (approximately 4.21% of the parameters of YOLOv4), lower computational complexity and better computational efficiency 6.59% of the GFLOPs of YOLOv4). These key findings indicate EcoWeedNet's deployability on low-power consumer hardware, lower energy consumption, and hence reduced carbon footprint, thereby emphasizing the application prospects of EcoWeedNet in next-generation sustainable agriculture. These findings provide the way forward for increased application of environmentally-friendly agricultural consumer technologies.

Abstract: Over the past few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly and are widely applied in various domains. However, LLMs face the issue of hallucinations, generating responses that may be unreliable when the models lack relevant knowledge. To be aware of potential hallucinations, uncertainty estimation methods have been introduced, and most of them have confirmed that reliability lies in critical tokens. However, probability-based methods perform poorly in identifying token reliability, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we reveal that the probability-based method fails to estimate token reliability due to the loss of evidence strength information which is accumulated in the training stage. Therefore, we present Logits-induced token uncertainty (LogTokU), a framework for estimating decoupled token uncertainty in LLMs, enabling real-time uncertainty estimation without requiring multiple sampling processes. We employ evidence modeling to implement LogTokU and use the estimated uncertainty to guide downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that LogTokU has significant effectiveness and promise.

<title>Generative Detail Enhancement for Physically Based Materials</title>

Abstract: We present a tool for enhancing the detail of physically based materials using an off-the-shelf diffusion model and inverse rendering. Our goal is to enhance the visual fidelity of materials with detail that is often tedious to author, by adding signs of wear, aging, weathering, etc. As these appearance details are often rooted in real-world processes, we leverage a generative image model trained on a large dataset of natural images with corresponding visuals in context. Starting with a given geometry, UV mapping, and basic appearance, we render multiple views of the object. We use these views, together with an appearance-defining text prompt, to condition a diffusion model. The details it generates are then backpropagated from the enhanced images to the material parameters via inverse differentiable rendering. For inverse rendering to be successful, the generated appearance has to be consistent across all the images. We propose two priors to address the multi-view consistency of the diffusion model. First, we ensure that the initial noise that seeds the diffusion process is itself consistent across views by integrating it from a view-independent UV space. Second, we enforce geometric consistency by biasing the attention mechanism via a projective constraint so that pixels attend strongly to their corresponding pixel locations in other views. Our approach does not require any training or finetuning of the diffusion model, is agnostic of the material model used, and the enhanced material properties, i.e., 2D PBR textures, can be further edited by artists.

<title>Liger: Linearizing Large Language Models to Gated Recurrent Structures</title>

Abstract: Transformers with linear recurrent modeling offer linear-time training and constant-memory inference. Despite their demonstrated efficiency and performance, pretraining such non-standard architectures from scratch remains costly and risky. The linearization of large language models (LLMs) transforms pretrained standard models into linear recurrent structures, enabling more efficient deployment. However, current linearization methods typically introduce additional feature map modules that require extensive fine-tuning and overlook the gating mechanisms used in state-of-the-art linear recurrent models. To address these issues, this paper presents Liger, short for Linearizing LLMs to gated recurrent structures. Liger is a novel approach for converting pretrained LLMs into gated linear recurrent models without adding extra parameters. It repurposes the pretrained key matrix weights to construct diverse gating mechanisms, facilitating the formation of various gated recurrent structures while avoiding the need to train additional components from scratch. Using lightweight fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Liger restores the performance of the linearized gated recurrent models to match that of the original LLMs. Additionally, we introduce Liger Attention, an intra-layer hybrid attention mechanism, which significantly recovers 93\% of the Transformer-based LLM at 0.02\% pre-training tokens during the linearization process, achieving competitive results across multiple benchmarks, as validated on models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters. Code is available at https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Linearization.

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks, we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Code: https://github.com/cspartalis/LoTUS.

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can naturally emerge through a simple reinforcement learning (RL) framework with rule-based rewards, where the training may directly start from the base models-a paradigm referred to as zero RL training. Most recent efforts to reproduce zero RL training have primarily focused on the Qwen2.5 model series, which may not be representative as we find the base models already exhibit strong instruction-following and self-reflection abilities. In this work, we investigate zero RL training across 10 diverse base models, spanning different families and sizes including LLama3-8B, Mistral-7B/24B, DeepSeek-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-math-7B, and all Qwen2.5 models from 0.5B to 32B. Leveraging several key design strategies-such as adjusting format reward and controlling query difficulty-we achieve substantial improvements in both reasoning accuracy and response length across most settings. However, by carefully monitoring the training dynamics, we observe that different base models exhibit distinct patterns during training. For instance, the increased response length does not always correlate with the emergence of certain cognitive behaviors such as verification (i.e., the "aha moment"). Notably, we observe the "aha moment" for the first time in small models not from the Qwen family. We share the key designs that enable successful zero RL training, along with our findings and practices. To facilitate further research, we open-source the code, models, and analysis tools.

Abstract: The Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem (STSP) is a variant of the classical Traveling Salesman Problem. The STSP involves incorporating steiner nodes, which are extra nodes not originally part of the required visit set but that can be added to the route to enhance the overall solution and minimize the total travel cost. Given the NP-hard nature of the STSP, we propose a quantum approach to address it. Specifically, we employ quantum annealing using D-Wave's hardware to explore its potential for solving this problem. To enhance computational feasibility, we develop a preprocessing method that effectively reduces the network size. Our experimental results demonstrate that this reduction technique significantly decreases the problem complexity, making the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation, the standard input for quantum annealers, better suited for existing quantum hardware. Furthermore, the results highlight the potential of quantum annealing as a promising and innovative approach for solving the STSP.

<title>FAST: Federated Active Learning with Foundation Models for Communication-efficient Sampling and Training</title>

Abstract: Federated Active Learning (FAL) has emerged as a promising framework to leverage large quantities of unlabeled data across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, real-world deployments remain limited by high annotation costs and communication-intensive sampling processes, particularly in a cross-silo setting, when clients possess substantial local datasets. This paper addresses the crucial question: What is the best practice to reduce communication costs in human-in-the-loop learning with minimal annotator effort? Existing FAL methods typically rely on iterative annotation processes that separate active sampling from federated updates, leading to multiple rounds of expensive communication and annotation. In response, we introduce FAST, a two-pass FAL framework that harnesses foundation models for weak labeling in a preliminary pass, followed by a refinement pass focused exclusively on the most uncertain samples. By leveraging representation knowledge from foundation models and integrating refinement steps into a streamlined workflow, FAST substantially reduces the overhead incurred by iterative active sampling. Extensive experiments on diverse medical and natural image benchmarks demonstrate that FAST outperforms existing FAL methods by an average of 4.36% while reducing communication rounds eightfold under a limited 5% labeling budget.

<title>Enhancing Metabolic Syndrome Prediction with Hybrid Data Balancing and Counterfactuals</title>

Abstract: Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of interrelated risk factors that significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. Despite its global prevalence, accurate prediction of MetS remains challenging due to issues such as class imbalance, data scarcity, and methodological inconsistencies in existing studies. In this paper, we address these challenges by systematically evaluating and optimizing machine learning (ML) models for MetS prediction, leveraging advanced data balancing techniques and counterfactual analysis. Multiple ML models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, TabNet, etc., were trained and compared under various data balancing techniques such as random oversampling (ROS), SMOTE, ADASYN, and CTGAN. Additionally, we introduce MetaBoost, a novel hybrid framework that integrates SMOTE, ADASYN, and CTGAN, optimizing synthetic data generation through weighted averaging and iterative weight tuning to enhance the model's performance (achieving up to a 1.87% accuracy improvement over individual balancing techniques). A comprehensive counterfactual analysis is conducted to quantify the feature-level changes required to shift individuals from high-risk to low-risk categories. The results indicate that blood glucose (50.3%) and triglycerides (46.7%) were the most frequently modified features, highlighting their clinical significance in MetS risk reduction. Additionally, probabilistic analysis shows elevated blood glucose (85.5% likelihood) and triglycerides (74.9% posterior probability) as the strongest predictors. This study not only advances the methodological rigor of MetS prediction but also provides actionable insights for clinicians and researchers, highlighting the potential of ML in mitigating the public health burden of metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: The loss landscape of Variational Quantum Neural Networks (VQNNs) is characterized by local minima that grow exponentially with increasing qubits. Because of this, it is more challenging to recover information from model gradients during training compared to classical Neural Networks (NNs). In this paper we present a numerical scheme that successfully reconstructs input training, real-world, practical data from trainable VQNNs' gradients. Our scheme is based on gradient inversion that works by combining gradients estimation with the finite difference method and adaptive low-pass filtering. The scheme is further optimized with Kalman filter to obtain efficient convergence. Our experiments show that our algorithm can invert even batch-trained data, given the VQNN model is sufficiently over-parameterized.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important part of our everyday lives, yet user requirements for designing AI-assisted systems in law enforcement remain unclear. To address this gap, we conducted qualitative research on decision-making within a law enforcement agency. Our study aimed to identify limitations of existing practices, explore user requirements and understand the responsibilities that humans expect to undertake in these systems.
  Participants in our study highlighted the need for a system capable of processing and analysing large volumes of data efficiently to help in crime detection and prevention. Additionally, the system should satisfy requirements for scalability, accuracy, justification, trustworthiness and adaptability to be adopted in this domain. Participants also emphasised the importance of having end users review the input data that might be challenging for AI to interpret, and validate the generated output to ensure the system's accuracy. To keep up with the evolving nature of the law enforcement domain, end users need to help the system adapt to the changes in criminal behaviour and government guidance, and technical experts need to regularly oversee and monitor the system. Furthermore, user-friendly human interaction with the system is essential for its adoption and some of the participants confirmed they would be happy to be in the loop and provide necessary feedback that the system can learn from. Finally, we argue that it is very unlikely that the system will ever achieve full automation due to the dynamic and complex nature of the law enforcement domain.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) as their foundational reasoning engine, are transforming clinical workflows such as medical report generation and clinical summarization by autonomously analyzing sensitive healthcare data and executing decisions with minimal human oversight. However, their adoption demands strict compliance with regulatory frameworks such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), particularly when handling Protected Health Information (PHI). This work-in-progress paper introduces a HIPAA-compliant Agentic AI framework that enforces regulatory compliance through dynamic, context-aware policy enforcement. Our framework integrates three core mechanisms: (1) Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for granular PHI governance, (2) a hybrid PHI sanitization pipeline combining regex patterns and BERT-based model to minimize leakage, and (3) immutable audit trails for compliance verification.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of large language models (LLMs), enabling them to perform new tasks based on a few provided examples without explicit fine-tuning. Despite their impressive adaptability, these models remain vulnerable to subtle adversarial perturbations and exhibit unpredictable behavior when faced with linguistic variations. Inspired by software testing principles, we introduce a software testing-inspired framework, called MMT4NL, for evaluating the trustworthiness of in-context learning by utilizing adversarial perturbations and software testing techniques. It includes diverse evaluation aspects of linguistic capabilities for testing the ICL capabilities of LLMs. MMT4NL is built around the idea of crafting metamorphic adversarial examples from a test set in order to quantify and pinpoint bugs in the designed prompts of ICL. Our philosophy is to treat any LLM as software and validate its functionalities just like testing the software. Finally, we demonstrate applications of MMT4NL on the sentiment analysis and question-answering tasks. Our experiments could reveal various linguistic bugs in state-of-the-art LLMs.

Abstract: With the advance of large language models (LLMs), LLMs have been utilized for the various tasks. However, the issues of variability and reproducibility of results from each trial of LLMs have been largely overlooked in existing literature while actual human annotation uses majority voting to resolve disagreements among annotators. Therefore, this study introduces the straightforward ensemble strategy to a sentiment analysis using LLMs. As the results, we demonstrate that the ensemble of multiple inference using medium-sized LLMs produces more robust and accurate results than using a large model with a single attempt with reducing RMSE by 18.6%.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved great success in numerous NLP tasks but continue to exhibit notable gaps in multi-step factual reasoning, especially when real-world knowledge is sparse. Recent advances in grokking have demonstrated that neural networks can transition from memorizing to perfectly generalizing once they detect underlying logical patterns - yet these studies have primarily used small, synthetic tasks. In this paper, for the first time, we extend grokking to real-world factual data and address the challenge of dataset sparsity by augmenting existing knowledge graphs with carefully designed synthetic data to raise the ratio $\phi_r$ of inferred facts to atomic facts above the threshold required for grokking. Surprisingly, we find that even factually incorrect synthetic data can strengthen emergent reasoning circuits rather than degrade accuracy, as it forces the model to rely on relational structure rather than memorization. When evaluated on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, our approach achieves up to 95-100% accuracy on 2WikiMultiHopQA - substantially improving over strong baselines and matching or exceeding current state-of-the-art results. We further provide an in-depth analysis of how increasing $\phi_r$ drives the formation of generalizing circuits inside Transformers. Our findings suggest that grokking-based data augmentation can unlock implicit multi-hop reasoning capabilities, opening the door to more robust and interpretable factual reasoning in large-scale language models.

Abstract: Generative AI systems have revolutionized human interaction by enabling natural language-based coding and problem solving. However, the inherent ambiguity of natural language often leads to imprecise instructions, forcing users to iteratively test, correct, and resubmit their prompts. We propose an iterative approach that systematically narrows down these ambiguities through a structured series of clarification questions and alternative solution proposals, illustrated with input/output examples as well. Once every uncertainty is resolved, a final, precise solution is generated. Evaluated on a diverse dataset spanning coding, data analysis, and creative writing, our method demonstrates superior accuracy, competitive resolution times, and higher user satisfaction compared to conventional one-shot solutions, which typically require multiple manual iterations to achieve a correct output.

Summary:<br />
- The study explores the impact of adding modalities on the performance and fairness of multimodal models in high-stakes decision-making.
- Adding new modalities during training consistently improves performance but has mixed effects on fairness measures.
- The absence of modalities at inference time leads to a decline in both performance and fairness, highlighting concerns about the robustness of multimodal models in real-world applications.
- Extensive experiments on healthcare datasets validate the findings, emphasizing the importance of considering bias and robustness alongside performance gains in multimodal learning.
- The study raises awareness of the need to address bias and ensure robustness in multimodal systems for equitable and reliable decision-making. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.03020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning, which integrates diverse data sources such as images, text, and structured data, has proven superior to unimodal counterparts in high-stakes decision-making. However, while performance gains remain the gold standard for evaluating multimodal systems, concerns around bias and robustness are frequently overlooked. In this context, this paper explores two key research questions (RQs): (i) RQ1 examines whether adding a modality con-sistently enhances performance and investigates its role in shaping fairness measures, assessing whether it mitigates or amplifies bias in multimodal models; (ii) RQ2 investigates the impact of missing modalities at inference time, analyzing how multimodal models generalize in terms of both performance and fairness. Our analysis reveals that incorporating new modalities during training consistently enhances the performance of multimodal models, while fairness trends exhibit variability across different evaluation measures and datasets. Additionally, the absence of modalities at inference degrades performance and fairness, raising concerns about its robustness in real-world deployment. We conduct extensive experiments using multimodal healthcare datasets containing images, time series, and structured information to validate our findings.

Abstract: Independent learners often struggle with sustaining focus and emotional regulation in unstructured or distracting settings. Although some rely on ambient aids such as music, ASMR, or visual backgrounds to support concentration, these tools are rarely integrated into cohesive, learner-centered systems. Moreover, existing educational technologies focus primarily on content adaptation and feedback, overlooking the emotional and sensory context in which learning takes place. Large language models have demonstrated powerful multimodal capabilities including the ability to generate and adapt text, audio, and visual content. Educational research has yet to fully explore their potential in creating personalized audiovisual learning environments. To address this gap, we introduce an AI-powered system that uses LLMs to generate personalized multisensory study environments. Users select or generate customized visual themes (e.g., abstract vs. realistic, static vs. animated) and auditory elements (e.g., white noise, ambient ASMR, familiar vs. novel sounds) to create immersive settings aimed at reducing distraction and enhancing emotional stability. Our primary research question investigates how combinations of personalized audiovisual elements affect learner cognitive load and engagement. Using a mixed-methods design that incorporates biometric measures and performance outcomes, this study evaluates the effectiveness of LLM-driven sensory personalization. The findings aim to advance emotionally responsive educational technologies and extend the application of multimodal LLMs into the sensory dimension of self-directed learning.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Brutally Long Audio Bench (BLAB), a benchmark for evaluating audio language models (LMs) on tasks including localization, duration estimation, emotion, and counting using long-form audio clips averaging 51 minutes. The study evaluates six audio LMs on BLAB and finds that even advanced models struggle with the tasks. Performance declines as audio duration increases, particularly in tasks like localization, temporal reasoning, and counting. The models rely heavily on prompts rather than audio content and have difficulty understanding non-phonemic information. BLAB highlights the challenges in developing audio LMs with robust long-form audio understanding capabilities, providing insights into the trade-offs between task difficulty and audio duration. <div>

Abstract: Developing large audio language models (LMs) capable of understanding diverse spoken interactions is essential for accommodating the multimodal nature of human communication and can increase the accessibility of language technologies across different user populations. Recent work on audio LMs has primarily evaluated their performance on short audio segments, typically under 30 seconds, with limited exploration of long-form conversational speech segments that more closely reflect natural user interactions with these models. We introduce Brutally Long Audio Bench (BLAB), a challenging long-form audio benchmark that evaluates audio LMs on localization, duration estimation, emotion, and counting tasks using audio segments averaging 51 minutes in length. BLAB consists of 833+ hours of diverse, full-length audio clips, each paired with human-annotated, text-based natural language questions and answers. Our audio data were collected from permissively licensed sources and underwent a human-assisted filtering process to ensure task compliance. We evaluate six open-source and proprietary audio LMs on BLAB and find that all of them, including advanced models such as Gemini 2.0 Pro and GPT-4o, struggle with the tasks in BLAB. Our comprehensive analysis reveals key insights into the trade-offs between task difficulty and audio duration. In general, we find that audio LMs struggle with long-form speech, with performance declining as duration increases. They perform poorly on localization, temporal reasoning, counting, and struggle to understand non-phonemic information, relying more on prompts than audio content. BLAB serves as a challenging evaluation framework to develop audio LMs with robust long-form audio understanding capabilities.

<div> deep learning, oyster monitoring, image analysis, prediction error, image quality

Summary: 
The study focused on using the ODYSSEE model, based on deep learning techniques, to identify live oysters in reef images for population monitoring. The model was faster than human annotators but had lower accuracy in identifying live oysters. Image quality was found to be crucial for both the model and annotators, with better quality images improving human accuracy but worsening model accuracy. Future improvements in the model could include training on higher-quality images, using more live imagery, and adding additional annotation training classes. The research also highlighted the need for better methods to differentiate between living and dead oysters in monitoring efforts.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oysters are ecologically and commercially important species that require frequent monitoring to track population demographics (e.g. abundance, growth, mortality). Current methods of monitoring oyster reefs often require destructive sampling methods and extensive manual effort. Therefore, they are suboptimal for small-scale or sensitive environments. A recent alternative, the ODYSSEE model, was developed to use deep learning techniques to identify live oysters using video or images taken in the field of oyster reefs to assess abundance. The validity of this model in identifying live oysters on a reef was compared to expert and non-expert annotators. In addition, we identified potential sources of prediction error. Although the model can make inferences significantly faster than expert and non-expert annotators (39.6 s, $2.34 \pm 0.61$ h, $4.50 \pm 1.46$ h, respectively), the model overpredicted the number of live oysters, achieving lower accuracy (63\%) in identifying live oysters compared to experts (74\%) and non-experts (75\%) alike. Image quality was an important factor in determining the accuracy of the model and the annotators. Better quality images improved human accuracy and worsened model accuracy. Although ODYSSEE was not sufficiently accurate, we anticipate that future training on higher-quality images, utilizing additional live imagery, and incorporating additional annotation training classes will greatly improve the model's predictive power based on the results of this analysis. Future research should address methods that improve the detection of living vs. dead oysters.

<div> Keywords: Internet connectivity, disinformation detection, Large Language Models (LLMs), evidence retrieval, fact-checking 

Summary: 
The study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated disinformation detection in the age of widespread Internet connectivity. Traditional deep learning models struggle to handle the complexity of multimodal disinformation, but LLMs show promise when provided with relevant evidence. However, LLMs are unable to autonomously search for accurate evidence. To address this limitation, the Holmes framework is proposed, which incorporates a novel evidence retrieval method. This method combines LLM-powered summarization to extract key information from open sources with a new algorithm and metrics to evaluate evidence quality. The framework enables LLMs to verify claims and generate justifications effectively, leading to improved fact-checking accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Holmes achieves high accuracy rates on both open-source datasets and real-time verification tasks, with a significant boost in fact-checking accuracy compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The rise of Internet connectivity has accelerated the spread of disinformation, threatening societal trust, decision-making, and national security. Disinformation has evolved from simple text to complex multimodal forms combining images and text, challenging existing detection methods. Traditional deep learning models struggle to capture the complexity of multimodal disinformation. Inspired by advances in AI, this study explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated disinformation detection. The empirical study shows that (1) LLMs alone cannot reliably assess the truthfulness of claims; (2) providing relevant evidence significantly improves their performance; (3) however, LLMs cannot autonomously search for accurate evidence. To address this, we propose Holmes, an end-to-end framework featuring a novel evidence retrieval method that assists LLMs in collecting high-quality evidence. Our approach uses (1) LLM-powered summarization to extract key information from open sources and (2) a new algorithm and metrics to evaluate evidence quality. Holmes enables LLMs to verify claims and generate justifications effectively. Experiments show Holmes achieves 88.3% accuracy on two open-source datasets and 90.2% in real-time verification tasks. Notably, our improved evidence retrieval boosts fact-checking accuracy by 30.8% over existing methods

Summary:   
CombiBench introduces a new benchmark dataset consisting of 100 combinatorial problems formalized in Lean 4 and covering various difficulty levels and topics. It includes all IMO combinatorial problems since 2000, except for one. The Fine-Eval evaluation framework is proposed for formal mathematics, including fill-in-the-blank questions. When benchmarking several large language models on CombiBench, it is found that their ability to formally solve combinatorial problems is limited. Among the models tested, Kimina-Prover performs the best, solving 7 out of 100 problems. The benchmark dataset and evaluation method code are open-sourced on GitHub at https://github.com/MoonshotAI/CombiBench/.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurosymbolic approaches integrating large language models with formal reasoning have recently achieved human-level performance on mathematics competition problems in algebra, geometry and number theory. In comparison, combinatorics remains a challenging domain, characterized by a lack of appropriate benchmarks and theorem libraries. To address this gap, we introduce CombiBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 100 combinatorial problems, each formalized in Lean~4 and paired with its corresponding informal statement. The problem set covers a wide spectrum of difficulty levels, ranging from middle school to IMO and university level, and span over ten combinatorial topics. CombiBench is suitable for testing IMO solving capabilities since it includes all IMO combinatorial problems since 2000 (except IMO 2004 P3 as its statement contain an images). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive and standardized evaluation framework, dubbed Fine-Eval (for $\textbf{F}$ill-in-the-blank $\textbf{in}$ L$\textbf{e}$an Evaluation), for formal mathematics. It accommodates not only proof-based problems but also, for the first time, the evaluation of fill-in-the-blank questions. Using Fine-Eval as the evaluation method and Kimina Lean Server as the backend, we benchmark several LLMs on CombiBench and observe that their capabilities for formally solving combinatorial problems remain limited. Among all models tested (none of which has been trained for this particular task), Kimina-Prover attains the best results, solving 7 problems (out of 100) under both ``with solution'' and ``without solution'' scenarios. We open source the benchmark dataset alongside with the code of the proposed evaluation method at https://github.com/MoonshotAI/CombiBench/.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, contrastive activation engineering, in-distribution settings, adversarial inputs, model perplexity

Summary:
CAE techniques offer a promising method for steering the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) through targeted modifications to their internal representations. However, the effectiveness of CAE is limited to in-distribution contexts and may result in diminishing returns beyond 80 samples for generating steering vectors. Additionally, CAE may be susceptible to adversarial inputs that reverse the desired behavior modification and can harm the overall model perplexity. Despite these drawbacks, larger LLMs exhibit greater resilience to steering-induced degradation. As such, while CAE presents a novel approach to task-specific behavior tuning of LLMs at zero cost during inference, careful consideration must be given to its application to ensure optimal performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
CAE techniques provide a method for steering Large Language Models' behavior through targeted modifications but are effective only in in-distribution contexts. Generating steering vectors with more than 80 samples offers diminishing returns, and the approach is vulnerable to adversarial inputs that can reverse desired behavior modifications and harm model perplexity. Larger models are more resistant to degradation caused by steering. Therefore, while CAE offers a cost-free method for task-specific behavior tuning during inference, its application requires caution to achieve optimal results. <div>
arXiv:2505.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge due to their inherent complexity and opacity. While techniques like fine-tuning can modify model behavior, they typically require extensive computational resources. Recent work has introduced a class of contrastive activation engineering (CAE) techniques as promising approaches for steering LLM outputs through targeted modifications to their internal representations. Applied at inference-time with zero cost, CAE has the potential to introduce a new paradigm of flexible, task-specific LLM behavior tuning. We analyze the performance of CAE in in-distribution, out-of-distribution settings, evaluate drawbacks, and begin to develop comprehensive guidelines for its effective deployment. We find that 1. CAE is only reliably effective when applied to in-distribution contexts. 2. Increasing the number of samples used to generate steering vectors has diminishing returns at around 80 samples. 3. Steering vectors are susceptible to adversarial inputs that reverses the behavior that is steered for. 4. Steering vectors harm the overall model perplexity. 5. Larger models are more resistant to steering-induced degradation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to effectively utilize a growing number of external tools, such as those defined by the Model Context Protocol (MCP)\cite{IntroducingMCP}, due to prompt bloat and selection complexity. We introduce RAG-MCP, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that overcomes this challenge by offloading tool discovery. RAG-MCP uses semantic retrieval to identify the most relevant MCP(s) for a given query from an external index before engaging the LLM. Only the selected tool descriptions are passed to the model, drastically reducing prompt size and simplifying decision-making. Experiments, including an MCP stress test, demonstrate RAG-MCP significantly cuts prompt tokens (e.g., by over 50%) and more than triples tool selection accuracy (43.13% vs 13.62% baseline) on benchmark tasks. RAG-MCP enables scalable and accurate tool integration for LLMs.

Abstract: Modern automation systems increasingly rely on modular architectures, with capabilities and skills as one solution approach. Capabilities define the functions of resources in a machine-readable form and skills provide the concrete implementations that realize those capabilities. However, the development of a skill implementation conforming to a corresponding capability remains a time-consuming and challenging task. In this paper, we present a method that treats capabilities as contracts for skill implementations and leverages large language models to generate executable code based on natural language user input. A key feature of our approach is the integration of existing software libraries and interface technologies, enabling the generation of skill implementations across different target languages. We introduce a framework that allows users to incorporate their own libraries and resource interfaces into the code generation process through a retrieval-augmented generation architecture. The proposed method is evaluated using an autonomous mobile robot controlled via Python and ROS 2, demonstrating the feasibility and flexibility of the approach.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting human behavior has emerged as a core capability in various AI application domains such as autonomous driving, smart healthcare, surveillance systems, and social robotics. This paper defines the technical framework of Artificial Behavior Intelligence (ABI), which comprehensively analyzes and interprets human posture, facial expressions, emotions, behavioral sequences, and contextual cues. It details the essential components of ABI, including pose estimation, face and emotion recognition, sequential behavior analysis, and context-aware modeling. Furthermore, we highlight the transformative potential of recent advances in large-scale pretrained models, such as large language models (LLMs), vision foundation models, and multimodal integration models, in significantly improving the accuracy and interpretability of behavior recognition. Our research team has a strong interest in the ABI domain and is actively conducting research, particularly focusing on the development of intelligent lightweight models capable of efficiently inferring complex human behaviors. This paper identifies several technical challenges that must be addressed to deploy ABI in real-world applications including learning behavioral intelligence from limited data, quantifying uncertainty in complex behavior prediction, and optimizing model structures for low-power, real-time inference. To tackle these challenges, our team is exploring various optimization strategies including lightweight transformers, graph-based recognition architectures, energy-aware loss functions, and multimodal knowledge distillation, while validating their applicability in real-time environments.

Summary:<br /><br />Large Language Models face challenges in critically peer reviewing scientific manuscripts due to data limitations and the complexity of expert reasoning. This study introduces Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP), a methodology using standard LLM chat interfaces to guide LLMs through detailed analysis workflows for evaluating experimental chemistry manuscripts. The PWP prompt is structured hierarchically via Markdown and developed through meta-prompting techniques to codify expert review workflows. It equips LLMs with persistent workflows triggered by queries, enabling systematic evaluations. Demonstrations show PWP-guided LLMs identifying methodological flaws, mitigating input bias, and performing complex tasks like integrating text/photo/figure analysis. The work showcases the potential of PWP in enabling sophisticated analyses using LLMs for complex scientific tasks, highlighting the importance of detailed workflow formalization. Supplementary resources provide transparency and facilitate replication of the study. <div>

Abstract: Critical peer review of scientific manuscripts presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), partly due to data limitations and the complexity of expert reasoning. This report introduces Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP), a potentially broadly applicable prompt engineering methodology designed to bridge this gap using standard LLM chat interfaces (zero-code, no APIs). We present a proof-of-concept PWP prompt for the critical analysis of experimental chemistry manuscripts, featuring a hierarchical, modular architecture (structured via Markdown) that defines detailed analysis workflows. We develop this PWP prompt through iterative application of meta-prompting techniques and meta-reasoning aimed at systematically codifying expert review workflows, including tacit knowledge. Submitted once at the start of a session, this PWP prompt equips the LLM with persistent workflows triggered by subsequent queries, guiding modern reasoning LLMs through systematic, multimodal evaluations. Demonstrations show the PWP-guided LLM identifying major methodological flaws in a test case while mitigating LLM input bias and performing complex tasks, including distinguishing claims from evidence, integrating text/photo/figure analysis to infer parameters, executing quantitative feasibility checks, comparing estimates against claims, and assessing a priori plausibility. To ensure transparency and facilitate replication, we provide full prompts, detailed demonstration analyses, and logs of interactive chats as supplementary resources. Beyond the specific application, this work offers insights into the meta-development process itself, highlighting the potential of PWP, informed by detailed workflow formalization, to enable sophisticated analysis using readily available LLMs for complex scientific tasks.

Abstract: Speech-based AI models are emerging as powerful tools for detecting depression and the presence of Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), offering a non-invasive and cost-effective way to assess mental health. However, these models often struggle with gender bias, which can lead to unfair and inaccurate predictions. In this study, our study addresses this issue by introducing a domain adversarial training approach that explicitly considers gender differences in speech-based depression and PTSD detection. Specifically, we treat different genders as distinct domains and integrate this information into a pretrained speech foundation model. We then validate its effectiveness on the E-DAIC dataset to assess its impact on performance. Experimental results show that our method notably improves detection performance, increasing the F1-score by up to 13.29 percentage points compared to the baseline. This highlights the importance of addressing demographic disparities in AI-driven mental health assessment.

Summary: 
This study explores a new approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) and learning analytics to assess children's development during free play in early childhood education. By analyzing children's self-narratives of their play experiences, the LLM accurately identifies cognitive, motor, and social abilities with over 90% accuracy. Performance scores from different play settings reveal significant differences in developmental outcomes, highlighting the unique contributions of each area to specific abilities. The proposed approach proves effective in identifying children's development across various play settings, offering valuable insights for personalized learning and enhancing early childhood education practices. This innovative method provides comprehensive insights into children's developmental trajectories, allowing educators to support individualized learning and improve educational strategies.

Abstract: Free play is a fundamental aspect of early childhood education, supporting children's cognitive, social, emotional, and motor development. However, assessing children's development during free play poses significant challenges due to the unstructured and spontaneous nature of the activity. Traditional assessment methods often rely on direct observations by teachers, parents, or researchers, which may fail to capture comprehensive insights from free play and provide timely feedback to educators. This study proposes an innovative approach combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with learning analytics to analyze children's self-narratives of their play experiences. The LLM identifies developmental abilities, while performance scores across different play settings are calculated using learning analytics techniques. We collected 2,224 play narratives from 29 children in a kindergarten, covering four distinct play areas over one semester. According to the evaluation results from eight professionals, the LLM-based approach achieved high accuracy in identifying cognitive, motor, and social abilities, with accuracy exceeding 90% in most domains. Moreover, significant differences in developmental outcomes were observed across play settings, highlighting each area's unique contributions to specific abilities. These findings confirm that the proposed approach is effective in identifying children's development across various free play settings. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs and learning analytics to provide child-centered insights into developmental trajectories, offering educators valuable data to support personalized learning and enhance early childhood education practices.

Summary:<br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tasks such as text generation and code completion due to their resemblance to human procedural memory. However, their limitations become apparent in complex and unpredictable environments. This paper argues that LLMs must be enhanced with semantic memory and associative learning systems to navigate such environments effectively. By adopting a modular architecture that separates these cognitive functions, a bridge can be created between procedural expertise and adaptive intelligence necessary for real-world problem-solving. The proposed approach aims to address the challenges posed by dynamic and novel learning environments, where rules are ever-changing, feedback is uncertain, and adaptability is crucial. <div>
arXiv:2505.03434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a landmark achievement in Artificial Intelligence (AI), demonstrating unprecedented proficiency in procedural tasks such as text generation, code completion, and conversational coherence. These capabilities stem from their architecture, which mirrors human procedural memory -- the brain's ability to automate repetitive, pattern-driven tasks through practice. However, as LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it becomes impossible to ignore their limitations operating in complex, unpredictable environments. This paper argues that LLMs, while transformative, are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on procedural memory. To create agents capable of navigating ``wicked'' learning environments -- where rules shift, feedback is ambiguous, and novelty is the norm -- we must augment LLMs with semantic memory and associative learning systems. By adopting a modular architecture that decouples these cognitive functions, we can bridge the gap between narrow procedural expertise and the adaptive intelligence required for real-world problem-solving.

Summary:  
In this study, the researchers investigate the steganographic capabilities of large language models (LLMs) that have been fine-tuned using reinforcement learning (RL). They aim to determine the models' ability to hide messages within plain text, particularly in scenarios where hidden reasoning is likely. The experiments show that while current models exhibit basic steganographic abilities in terms of security and capacity, explicit algorithmic guidance significantly enhances their information concealment capabilities. The findings suggest that these LLMs can develop covert encoding schemes, engage in steganography when prompted, and use steganography in realistic scenarios. By detecting the intention of LLMs to hide reasoning and evaluating their steganography performance, the researchers highlight the challenges in detecting and thwarting unaligned AI agents and the potential implications for the faithfulness of LLM reasoning. <div>

Abstract: The potential for large language models (LLMs) to hide messages within plain text (steganography) poses a challenge to detection and thwarting of unaligned AI agents, and undermines faithfulness of LLMs reasoning. We explore the steganographic capabilities of LLMs fine-tuned via reinforcement learning (RL) to: (1) develop covert encoding schemes, (2) engage in steganography when prompted, and (3) utilize steganography in realistic scenarios where hidden reasoning is likely, but not prompted. In these scenarios, we detect the intention of LLMs to hide their reasoning as well as their steganography performance. Our findings in the fine-tuning experiments as well as in behavioral non fine-tuning evaluations reveal that while current models exhibit rudimentary steganographic abilities in terms of security and capacity, explicit algorithmic guidance markedly enhances their capacity for information concealment.

Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces a novel stable arena framework for evaluating modern AI models, specifically large language models (LLMs). The framework addresses issues with existing methods by enhancing the ELO Rating System with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach, m-ELO, and am-ELO, which considers annotator abilities. The MLE approach is proven to be consistent and stable for model ranking, providing a more robust evaluation method. The am-ELO method incorporates annotator abilities, allowing for simultaneous estimation of model scores and annotator reliability. Experiments demonstrate the stability and accuracy of this framework, showing it to be a more reliable method for evaluating LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Arena-based evaluation is a fundamental yet significant evaluation paradigm for modern AI models, especially large language models (LLMs). Existing framework based on ELO rating system suffers from the inevitable instability problem due to ranking inconsistency and the lack of attention to the varying abilities of annotators. In this paper, we introduce a novel stable arena framework to address these issues by enhancing the ELO Rating System. Specifically, we replace the iterative update method with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach, m-ELO, and provide theoretical proof of the consistency and stability of the MLE approach for model ranking. Additionally, we proposed the am-ELO, which modify the Elo Rating's probability function to incorporate annotator abilities, enabling the simultaneous estimation of model scores and annotator reliability. Experiments demonstrate that this method ensures stability, proving that this framework offers a more robust, accurate, and stable evaluation method for LLMs.

<div> approach, large language models, text-based interactive fiction games, action generation, dynamic action generation
Summary:
The article introduces STORY2GAME, a method using Large Language Models to create text-based interactive fiction games. It begins by generating a story, building the game world, and creating code for actions in a game engine to enable interactive storytelling. Unlike predefined actions limiting story generation, generating actions allows for more open-ended storytelling while maintaining grounded game experiences. Successful action generation relies on using LLM-generated preconditions and effects as guides for tracking and changing the game state when players act. The technique includes dynamically generating new actions to accommodate player choices not in the original story, requiring updates to the game engine's state representation. The evaluation focuses on the success rate of action code generation in enabling players to interactively navigate through the entire generated story.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce STORY2GAME, a novel approach to using Large Language Models to generate text-based interactive fiction games that starts by generating a story, populates the world, and builds the code for actions in a game engine that enables the story to play out interactively. Whereas a given set of hard-coded actions can artificially constrain story generation, the ability to generate actions means the story generation process can be more open-ended but still allow for experiences that are grounded in a game state. The key to successful action generation is to use LLM-generated preconditions and effects of actions in the stories as guides for what aspects of the game state must be tracked and changed by the game engine when a player performs an action. We also introduce a technique for dynamically generating new actions to accommodate the player's desire to perform actions that they think of that are not part of the story. Dynamic action generation may require on-the-fly updates to the game engine's state representation and revision of previously generated actions. We evaluate the success rate of action code generation with respect to whether a player can interactively play through the entire generated story.

<div> consensus mechanism, language models, distributed ledger technology, Hashgraph, AI ensembles

Summary:
The article introduces a novel consensus mechanism inspired by distributed ledger technology to address the issue of inconsistent outputs and hallucinations from large language models (LLMs). Different proprietary reasoning models (RMs) often produce divergent results due to variations in training and inference. The proposed mechanism, based on the Hashgraph consensus algorithm, involves treating each RM as a black-box peer and using gossip-about-gossip communication and virtual voting to achieve agreement among an ensemble of RMs. This approach goes beyond simple majority voting by incorporating the knowledge and cross-verification content of every model. The article outlines an architectural design for a prototype system where RMs exchange and update their answers iteratively to improve accuracy and confidence in subsequent rounds. This Hashgraph-inspired consensus offers a promising direction for multi-agent AI systems to self-validate and deliver high-fidelity responses in complex tasks.

Abstract: Inconsistent outputs and hallucinations from large language models (LLMs) are major obstacles to reliable AI systems. When different proprietary reasoning models (RMs), such as those by OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI, are given the same complex request, they often produce divergent results due to variations in training and inference. This paper proposes a novel consensus mechanism, inspired by distributed ledger technology, to validate and converge these outputs, treating each RM as a black-box peer. Building on the Hashgraph consensus algorithm, our approach employs gossip-about-gossip communication and virtual voting to achieve agreement among an ensemble of RMs. We present an architectural design for a prototype system in which RMs iteratively exchange and update their answers, using information from each round to improve accuracy and confidence in subsequent rounds. This approach goes beyond simple majority voting by incorporating the knowledge and cross-verification content of every model. We justify the feasibility of this Hashgraph-inspired consensus for AI ensembles and outline its advantages over traditional ensembling techniques in reducing nonfactual outputs. Preliminary considerations for implementation, evaluation criteria for convergence and accuracy, and potential challenges are discussed. The proposed mechanism demonstrates a promising direction for multi-agent AI systems to self-validate and deliver high-fidelity responses in complex tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OSUniverse: a benchmark of complex, multimodal desktop-oriented tasks for advanced GUI-navigation AI agents that focuses on ease of use, extensibility, comprehensive coverage of test cases, and automated validation. We divide the tasks in increasing levels of complexity, from basic precision clicking to multistep, multiapplication tests requiring dexterity, precision, and clear thinking from the agent. In version one of the benchmark, presented here, we have calibrated the complexity of the benchmark test cases to ensure that the SOTA (State of the Art) agents (at the time of publication) do not achieve results higher than 50%, while the average white collar worker can perform all these tasks with perfect accuracy. The benchmark can be scored manually, but we also introduce an automated validation mechanism that has an average error rate less than 2%. Therefore, this benchmark presents solid ground for fully automated measuring of progress, capabilities and the effectiveness of GUI-navigation AI agents over the short and medium-term horizon. The source code of the benchmark is available at https://github.com/agentsea/osuniverse.

Abstract: Human decision-making in cognitive tasks and daily life exhibits considerable variability, shaped by factors such as task difficulty, individual preferences, and personal experiences. Understanding this variability across individuals is essential for uncovering the perceptual and decision-making mechanisms that humans rely on when faced with uncertainty and ambiguity. We present a computational framework BAM (Boundary Alignment & Manipulation framework) that combines perceptual boundary sampling in ANNs and human behavioral experiments to systematically investigate this phenomenon. Our perceptual boundary sampling algorithm generates stimuli along ANN decision boundaries that intrinsically induce significant perceptual variability. The efficacy of these stimuli is empirically validated through large-scale behavioral experiments involving 246 participants across 116,715 trials, culminating in the variMNIST dataset containing 19,943 systematically annotated images. Through personalized model alignment and adversarial generation, we establish a reliable method for simultaneously predicting and manipulating the divergent perceptual decisions of pairs of participants. This work bridges the gap between computational models and human individual difference research, providing new tools for personalized perception analysis.

Abstract: Learning-enabled planning and control algorithms are increasingly popular, but they often lack rigorous guarantees of performance or safety. We introduce an algorithm for computing underapproximate backward reachable sets of nonlinear discrete time neural feedback loops.

We rigorously analyze the soundness of our algorithm and demonstrate it on a numerical example. Our work expands the class of properties that can be verified for learning-enabled systems.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates temporal logical reasoning with Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to enable interpretable decision-making under uncertainty using macro-actions. The method utilizes a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) based on Event Calculus (EC) to create persistent macro-actions that guide POMDP solvers during planning, resulting in reduced inference time and enhanced performance. These macro-actions are learned through Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) from a small number of execution traces, eliminating the need for manual heuristics. In experiments on benchmark scenarios like Pocman and Rocksample, the learned macro-actions outperform traditional heuristics in terms of expressiveness and generality, offering significant computational efficiency gains. This approach paves the way for more efficient and interpretable decision-making in uncertain environments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an integration of temporal logical reasoning and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to achieve interpretable decision-making under uncertainty with macro-actions. Our method leverages a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) based on Event Calculus (EC) to generate \emph{persistent} (i.e., constant) macro-actions, which guide Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based POMDP solvers over a time horizon, significantly reducing inference time while ensuring robust performance. Such macro-actions are learnt via Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) from a few traces of execution (belief-action pairs), thus eliminating the need for manually designed heuristics and requiring only the specification of the POMDP transition model. In the Pocman and Rocksample benchmark scenarios, our learned macro-actions demonstrate increased expressiveness and generality when compared to time-independent heuristics, indeed offering substantial computational efficiency improvements.

Summary: 
The study examines the impact of AI agents' ability to share inferred human goals on task performance and collaboration. Three conditions were compared - no recognition, viable goals, and viable goals on-demand. Results showed goal-sharing information did not significantly improve task performance but supported strategic adaptations and subjective perceptions of collaboration. Cognitive load assessments revealed no additional burden across conditions. The study highlights the challenge of balancing informativeness and simplicity in human-agent interactions. Goal-sharing fosters trust and enhances perceived collaboration but may not always lead to objective performance gains. <div>
arXiv:2505.03674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In human-agent teams, openly sharing goals is often assumed to enhance planning, collaboration, and effectiveness. However, direct communication of these goals is not always feasible, requiring teammates to infer their partner's intentions through actions. Building on this, we investigate whether an AI agent's ability to share its inferred understanding of a human teammate's goals can improve task performance and perceived collaboration. Through an experiment comparing three conditions-no recognition (NR), viable goals (VG), and viable goals on-demand (VGod) - we find that while goal-sharing information did not yield significant improvements in task performance or overall satisfaction scores, thematic analysis suggests that it supported strategic adaptations and subjective perceptions of collaboration. Cognitive load assessments revealed no additional burden across conditions, highlighting the challenge of balancing informativeness and simplicity in human-agent interactions. These findings highlight the nuanced trade-off of goal-sharing: while it fosters trust and enhances perceived collaboration, it can occasionally hinder objective performance gains.

Abstract: Our work contributes to the fast-growing literature on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform graph-related tasks. In particular, we focus on usage scenarios that rely on the visual modality, feeding the model with a drawing of the graph under analysis. We investigate how the model's performance is affected by the chosen layout paradigm, the aesthetics of the drawing, and the prompting technique used for the queries. We formulate three corresponding research questions and present the results of a thorough experimental analysis. Our findings reveal that choosing the right layout paradigm and optimizing the readability of the input drawing from a human perspective can significantly improve the performance of the model on the given task. Moreover, selecting the most effective prompting technique is a challenging yet crucial task for achieving optimal performance.

Artificial intelligence in medical imaging has experienced significant growth, driven by advancements in deep learning and computing resources. This growth has led to applications across various medical imaging modalities, each with unique characteristics based on the underlying physics of the technique. However, many AI professionals in this field lack a comprehensive understanding of the physical principles governing medical image acquisition, impeding their ability to maximize the technology's potential. Integrating physics knowledge into AI algorithms can enhance their reliability and resilience, particularly in scenarios where data availability is limited.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medical imaging has seen unprecedented growth in the last years, due to rapid advances in deep learning and computing resources. Applications cover the full range of existing medical imaging modalities, with unique characteristics driven by the physics of each technique. Yet, artificial intelligence professionals entering the field, and even experienced developers, often lack a comprehensive understanding of the physical principles underlying medical image acquisition, which hinders their ability to fully leverage its potential. The integration of physics knowledge into artificial intelligence algorithms enhances their trustworthiness and robustness in medical imaging, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. In this work, we review the fundamentals of physics in medical images and their impact on the latest advances in artificial intelligence, particularly, in generative models and reconstruction algorithms. Finally, we explore the integration of physics knowledge into physics-inspired machine learning models, which leverage physics-based constraints to enhance the learning of medical imaging features.

<div> sandbox, governance, regulation, artificial intelligence, signal detection theory

Summary:
In the debate over regulating Artificial Intelligence, the Precautionary Principle (PP) and the Innovation Principle (IP) are often seen as contradictory. However, weak forms of PP and IP actually complement each other by ensuring that regulatory decisions account for the costs of both overregulation and underregulation. The Signal Detection Theory (SDT) model shows that decisions to regulate AI should be based on a consideration of the expected costs of false positives and false negatives. By implementing regulatory sandboxing, regulators can observe how AI innovations impact society in a controlled setting, allowing for better decisions regarding regulation. Sandbox environments help regulators and innovators understand the cost ratio of mistakes and make appropriate adjustments to avoid excessive regulation while ensuring AI development is safe and responsible. <div>

Abstract: In policy debates concerning the governance and regulation of Artificial Intelligence (AI), both the Precautionary Principle (PP) and the Innovation Principle (IP) are advocated by their respective interest groups. Do these principles offer wholly incompatible and contradictory guidance? Does one necessarily negate the other? I argue here that provided attention is restricted to weak-form PP and IP, the answer to both of these questions is "No." The essence of these weak formulations is the requirement to fully account for type-I error costs arising from erroneously preventing the innovation's diffusion through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory red-lighting) as well as the type-II error costs arising from erroneously allowing the innovation to diffuse through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory green-lighting). Within the Signal Detection Theory (SDT) model developed here, weak-PP red-light (weak-IP green-light) determinations are optimal for sufficiently small (large) ratios of expected type-I to type-II error costs. For intermediate expected cost ratios, an amber-light 'wait-and-monitor' policy is optimal. Regulatory sandbox instruments allow AI testing and experimentation to take place within a structured environment of limited duration and societal scale, whereby the expected cost ratio falls within the 'wait-and-monitor' range. Through sandboxing regulators and innovating firms learn more about the expected cost ratio, and what respective adaptations -- of regulation, of technical solution, of business model, or combination thereof, if any -- are needed to keep the ratio out of the weak-PP red-light zone.

Assessing the understanding of large language models (LLMs) in human interactions is challenging. To address this, the Sentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE) framework is introduced, focusing on measuring an LLM's social cognition in multi-turn conversations. SAGE simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts in interaction, providing a more realistic evaluation. Experiments on 100 scenarios show that the Sentient emotion score correlates strongly with psychological metrics. A public Sentient Leaderboard comparing 18 models reveals significant performance gaps between newer systems and earlier baselines.

Abstract: Assessing how well a large language model (LLM) understands human, rather than merely text, remains an open challenge. To bridge the gap, we introduce Sentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE), an automated evaluation framework that measures an LLM's higher-order social cognition. SAGE instantiates a Sentient Agent that simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts during interaction, providing a more realistic evaluation of the tested model in multi-turn conversations. At every turn, the agent reasons about (i) how its emotion changes, (ii) how it feels, and (iii) how it should reply, yielding a numerical emotion trajectory and interpretable inner thoughts. Experiments on 100 supportive-dialogue scenarios show that the final Sentient emotion score correlates strongly with Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) ratings and utterance-level empathy metrics, validating psychological fidelity. We also build a public Sentient Leaderboard covering 18 commercial and open-source models that uncovers substantial gaps (up to 4x) between frontier systems (GPT-4o-Latest, Gemini2.5-Pro) and earlier baselines, gaps not reflected in conventional leaderboards (e.g., Arena). SAGE thus provides a principled, scalable and interpretable tool for tracking progress toward genuinely empathetic and socially adept language agents.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) in healthcare must align with stakeholder preferences for effective implementation. Human professionals play a critical role in guiding and enhancing LLM performance throughout the lifecycle.

Abstract: The wide exploration of large language models (LLMs) raises the awareness of alignment between healthcare stakeholder preferences and model outputs. This alignment becomes a crucial foundation to empower the healthcare workflow effectively, safely, and responsibly. Yet the varying behaviors of LLMs may not always match with healthcare stakeholders' knowledge, demands, and values. To enable a human-AI alignment, healthcare stakeholders will need to perform essential roles in guiding and enhancing the performance of LLMs. Human professionals must participate in the entire life cycle of adopting LLM in healthcare, including training data curation, model training, and inference. In this review, we discuss the approaches, tools, and applications of alignments between healthcare stakeholders and LLMs. We demonstrate that LLMs can better follow human values by properly enhancing healthcare knowledge integration, task understanding, and human guidance. We provide outlooks on enhancing the alignment between humans and LLMs to build trustworthy real-world healthcare applications.

Our research aims to address these gaps by integrating skill-aligned feedback via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) into prompt engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs) and developing an application to enhance learning through personalised tutoring in a computer science programming context. The pilot study evaluated a proposed system using three quantitative metrics: readability score, response time, and feedback depth, across three programming tasks of varying complexity. The system successfully sorted simulated students into three skill-level categories and provided context-aware feedback. This targeted approach demonstrated better effectiveness and adaptability compared to general methods.

<div> Hierarchical concept map, MCQs, LLMs, common misconceptions, automated validation <br />
Summary:<br />
The study introduces a hierarchical concept map-based framework for generating high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs) targeting diverse cognitive levels and incorporating common misconceptions in physics education. The framework utilizes an efficient database design and automated pipeline to guide Language Model Models (LLMs) in generating MCQs and distractors. Expert evaluations show the framework outperforms baseline approaches with a 75.20% success rate in meeting quality criteria. Student assessments indicate a lower guess success rate (28.05%) for the concept map-driven approach, suggesting more effective assessment of conceptual understanding. The framework enables robust assessment across cognitive levels, quick identification of conceptual gaps, and facilitates targeted interventions at scale.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Generating high-quality MCQs, especially those targeting diverse cognitive levels and incorporating common misconceptions into distractor design, is time-consuming and expertise-intensive, making manual creation impractical at scale. Current automated approaches typically generate questions at lower cognitive levels and fail to incorporate domain-specific misconceptions. This paper presents a hierarchical concept map-based framework that provides structured knowledge to guide LLMs in generating MCQs with distractors. We chose high-school physics as our test domain and began by developing a hierarchical concept map covering major Physics topics and their interconnections with an efficient database design. Next, through an automated pipeline, topic-relevant sections of these concept maps are retrieved to serve as a structured context for the LLM to generate questions and distractors that specifically target common misconceptions. Lastly, an automated validation is completed to ensure that the generated MCQs meet the requirements provided. We evaluate our framework against two baseline approaches: a base LLM and a RAG-based generation. We conducted expert evaluations and student assessments of the generated MCQs. Expert evaluation shows that our method significantly outperforms the baseline approaches, achieving a success rate of 75.20% in meeting all quality criteria compared to approximately 37% for both baseline methods. Student assessment data reveal that our concept map-driven approach achieved a significantly lower guess success rate of 28.05% compared to 37.10% for the baselines, indicating a more effective assessment of conceptual understanding. The results demonstrate that our concept map-based approach enables robust assessment across cognitive levels and instant identification of conceptual gaps, facilitating faster feedback loops and targeted interventions at scale.

Summary: <br />
The article discusses the importance of co-adaptive dynamics in human education and the lack of computational models to simulate such interactions. The authors introduce a computational model that incorporates contextual insights on human education to evaluate different teacher-student interaction strategies. Results from simulations in a synthetic classroom setting show that bidirectional agency-based strategies outperform unilateral approaches, benefiting all types of learners. The model allows for testing and scaling of context-specific educational insights and hypothesis generation in adaptable environments. By bridging non-computational theories of human education with AI systems, the model lays a foundation for inclusive and equitable technologies that can dynamically adapt to learner needs. <div>

Abstract: Human education transcends mere knowledge transfer, it relies on co-adaptation dynamics -- the mutual adjustment of teaching and learning strategies between agents. Despite its centrality, computational models of co-adaptive teacher-student interactions (T-SI) remain underdeveloped. We argue that this gap impedes Educational Science in testing and scaling contextual insights across diverse settings, and limits the potential of Machine Learning systems, which struggle to emulate and adaptively support human learning processes. To address this, we present a computational T-SI model that integrates contextual insights on human education into a testable framework. We use the model to evaluate diverse T-SI strategies in a realistic synthetic classroom setting, simulating student groups with unequal access to sensory information. Results show that strategies incorporating co-adaptation principles (e.g., bidirectional agency) outperform unilateral approaches (i.e., where only the teacher or the student is active), improving the learning outcomes for all learning types. Beyond the testing and scaling of context-dependent educational insights, our model enables hypothesis generation in controlled yet adaptable environments. This work bridges non-computational theories of human education with scalable, inclusive AI in Education systems, providing a foundation for equitable technologies that dynamically adapt to learner needs.

<div> benchmark, generative AI systems, reproducibility, reliability, regression testing

Summary:
The article introduces GPR-bench, a benchmark for generative AI systems to address challenges of reproducibility and reliability. It includes an open dataset in English and Japanese covering various tasks and scenarios, with automated evaluation using "LLM-as-a-Judge" scoring. Experiments with different model versions show modest improvements in correctness but significant enhancement in conciseness with concise-writing instructions. The benchmark may not effectively differentiate between recent model versions, highlighting the importance of prompt engineering. GPR-bench is released under the MIT License, aiming to lower the barrier to reproducibility monitoring and facilitate community-driven extensions. This study raises considerations about benchmark design for evolving language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reproducibility and reliability remain pressing challenges for generative AI systems whose behavior can drift with each model update or prompt revision. We introduce GPR-bench, a lightweight, extensible benchmark that operationalizes regression testing for general purpose use cases. GPR-bench couples an open, bilingual (English and Japanese) dataset covering eight task categories (e.g., text generation, code generation, and information retrieval) and 10 scenarios in each task categories (80 total test cases for each language) with an automated evaluation pipeline that employs "LLM-as-a-Judge" scoring of correctness and conciseness. Experiments across three recent model versions - gpt-4o-mini, o3-mini, and o4-mini - and two prompt configurations (default versus concise-writing instruction) reveal heterogeneous quality. Our results show that newer models generally improve correctness, but the differences are modest and not statistically significant, suggesting that GPR-bench may not be sufficiently challenging to differentiate between recent model versions. In contrast, the concise-writing instruction significantly enhances conciseness (+12.37 pp, Mann-Whitney U test: p < 0.001, effect size r = 0.2995) with minimal degradations on accuracy (-1.7 pp), demonstrating the effectiveness of prompt engineering. Released under the MIT License, GPR- bench lowers the barrier to initiating reproducibility monitoring and provides a foundation for community-driven extensions, while also raising important considerations about benchmark design for rapidly evolving language models.

Summary: 
Data quality and availability, as well as model scalability, are common challenges faced by both AI professionals in academia and industry. However, industry professionals also encounter deployment constraints, resource limitations, and external dependencies, while academics focus more on theoretical adaptation and standardization issues. Both groups highlight difficulties in data and model adaptation, but industry professionals emphasize real-world constraints such as deployment and resource limitations. Academics, on the other hand, prioritize theoretical adaptation and standardization challenges. The study suggests that AI curricula should integrate real-world complexities, software engineering principles, and interdisciplinary learning to better prepare students for the challenges they will face in both academia and industry. Additionally, the broader educational goals of building foundational and ethical reasoning skills should be considered in AI education. <div>

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies continue to evolve, the gap between academic AI education and real-world industry challenges remains an important area of investigation. This study provides preliminary insights into challenges AI professionals encounter in both academia and industry, based on semi-structured interviews with 14 AI experts - eight from industry and six from academia. We identify key challenges related to data quality and availability, model scalability, practical constraints, user behavior, and explainability. While both groups experience data and model adaptation difficulties, industry professionals more frequently highlight deployment constraints, resource limitations, and external dependencies, whereas academics emphasize theoretical adaptation and standardization issues. These exploratory findings suggest that AI curricula could better integrate real-world complexities, software engineering principles, and interdisciplinary learning, while recognizing the broader educational goals of building foundational and ethical reasoning skills.

Abstract: Across various sectors applications of eXplainableAI (XAI) gained momentum as the increasing black-boxedness of prevailing Machine Learning (ML) models became apparent. In parallel, Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly developed in their abilities to understand human language and complex patterns. By combining both, this paper presents a novel reference architecture for the interpretation of XAI through an interactive chatbot powered by a fine-tuned LLM. We instantiate the reference architecture in the context of State-of-Health (SoH) prediction for batteries and validate its design in multiple evaluation and demonstration rounds. The evaluation indicates that the implemented prototype enhances the human interpretability of ML, especially for users with less experience with XAI.

<div> Neural orchestration, Multi-agent systems, Task selection, Supervised learning, Adaptive architecture
Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces MetaOrch, a neural orchestration framework designed to optimize agent selection in multi-domain task environments within multi-agent systems (MAS). Traditional MAS architectures have limitations in adapting to dynamic tasks and coordinating agents effectively. MetaOrch utilizes supervised learning to predict the most suitable agent for a given task based on task context, agent histories, and expected response quality. A fuzzy evaluation module scores agent responses, generating soft supervision labels for training the orchestrator. Unlike traditional methods, MetaOrch dynamically selects agents while estimating selection confidence, outperforming baseline strategies with 86.3% accuracy in simulated environments. The modular architecture allows for independent agent registration, updates, and queries, emphasizing extensibility. The experimental results suggest that neural orchestration enhances the autonomy, interpretability, and adaptability of MAS, offering a promising approach for diverse task domains. <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are foundational in simulating complex real-world scenarios involving autonomous, interacting entities. However, traditional MAS architectures often suffer from rigid coordination mechanisms and difficulty adapting to dynamic tasks. We propose MetaOrch, a neural orchestration framework for optimal agent selection in multi-domain task environments. Our system implements a supervised learning approach that models task context, agent histories, and expected response quality to select the most appropriate agent for each task. A novel fuzzy evaluation module scores agent responses along completeness, relevance, and confidence dimensions, generating soft supervision labels for training the orchestrator. Unlike previous methods that hard-code agent-task mappings, MetaOrch dynamically predicts the most suitable agent while estimating selection confidence. Experiments in simulated environments with heterogeneous agents demonstrate that our approach achieves 86.3% selection accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline strategies including random selection and round-robin scheduling. The modular architecture emphasizes extensibility, allowing agents to be registered, updated, and queried independently. Results suggest that neural orchestration offers a powerful approach to enhancing the autonomy, interpretability, and adaptability of multi-agent systems across diverse task domains.

Summary:
The study introduces a novel jailbreak attack framework, ICRT, aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by human cognitive biases, the framework leverages the simplicity effect and relevance bias to craft malicious prompts that bypass LLMs' safety mechanisms effectively. By introducing a ranking-based harmfulness evaluation metric, the researchers surpass traditional binary success metrics, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the risks posed by generated content. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's consistent ability to generate high-risk content and bypass mainstream LLMs' defenses. The approach sheds light on potential risks associated with jailbreak attacks and offers valuable insights for enhancing defense strategies against such threats. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can compromise their safety mechanisms. Existing studies often rely on brute-force optimization or manual design, failing to uncover potential risks in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel jailbreak attack framework, ICRT, inspired by heuristics and biases in human cognition. Leveraging the simplicity effect, we employ cognitive decomposition to reduce the complexity of malicious prompts. Simultaneously, relevance bias is utilized to reorganize prompts, enhancing semantic alignment and inducing harmful outputs effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a ranking-based harmfulness evaluation metric that surpasses the traditional binary success-or-failure paradigm by employing ranking aggregation methods such as Elo, HodgeRank, and Rank Centrality to comprehensively quantify the harmfulness of generated content. Experimental results show that our approach consistently bypasses mainstream LLMs' safety mechanisms and generates high-risk content, providing insights into jailbreak attack risks and contributing to stronger defense strategies.

Summary: 
- University students in higher academic years are more inclined to use generative AI (GAI) and prefer it over traditional resources. 
- Non-native English speakers adopt GAI more readily than native speakers. 
- Asian students report higher GAI usage and perceive greater academic benefits compared to White students, while Black students report a more positive impact on academic performance. 
- Personality traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, emotional stability, extraversion, and intellect/imagination significantly predict GAI use and attitudes. 
- Higher conscientiousness is associated with lower GAI use, while higher emotional stability leads to a more positive impact of GAI on learning. Students with higher intellect/imagination tend to prefer traditional resources. Universities should provide personalized guidance to ensure effective, ethical, and equitable use of GAI by students.

Abstract: The use of generative AI (GAI) among university students is rapidly increasing, yet empirical research on students' GAI use and the factors influencing it remains limited. To address this gap, we surveyed 363 undergraduate and graduate students in the United States, examining their GAI usage and how it relates to demographic variables and personality traits based on the Big Five model (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability, and intellect/imagination). Our findings reveal: (a) Students in higher academic years are more inclined to use GAI and prefer it over traditional resources. (b) Non-native English speakers use and adopt GAI more readily than native speakers. (c) Compared to White, Asian students report higher GAI usage, perceive greater academic benefits, and express a stronger preference for it. Similarly, Black students report a more positive impact of GAI on their academic performance. Personality traits also play a significant role in shaping perceptions and usage of GAI. After controlling demographic factors, we found that personality still significantly predicts GAI use and attitudes: (a) Students with higher conscientiousness use GAI less. (b) Students who are higher in agreeableness perceive a less positive impact of GAI on academic performance and express more ethical concerns about using it for academic work. (c) Students with higher emotional stability report a more positive impact of GAI on learning and fewer concerns about its academic use. (d) Students with higher extraversion show a stronger preference for GAI over traditional resources. (e) Students with higher intellect/imagination tend to prefer traditional resources. These insights highlight the need for universities to provide personalized guidance to ensure students use GAI effectively, ethically, and equitably in their academic pursuits.

Summary:<br />
Tree-search-based reasoning methods in large language models (LLMs) have improved reasoning capability but are hindered by slow inference due to generating numerous thoughts. To address this, a Speculative Search (SpecSearch) framework is proposed that optimizes thought generation by employing a small model to collaborate strategically with a large model at thought and token levels. SpecSearch utilizes a quality-preserving rejection mechanism to filter out low-quality thoughts, maintaining reasoning quality comparable to the large model. Experiments on Qwen and Llama models show that SpecSearch outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 2.12$\times$ speedup with similar reasoning quality. <div>

Abstract: Tree-search-based reasoning methods have significantly enhanced the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by facilitating the exploration of multiple intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., thoughts. However, these methods suffer from substantial inference latency, as they have to generate numerous reasoning thoughts, severely limiting LLM applicability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Speculative Search (SpecSearch) framework that significantly accelerates LLM reasoning by optimizing thought generation. Specifically, SpecSearch utilizes a small model to strategically collaborate with a large model at both thought and token levels, efficiently generating high-quality reasoning thoughts. The major pillar of SpecSearch is a novel quality-preserving rejection mechanism, which effectively filters out thoughts whose quality falls below that of the large model's outputs. Moreover, we show that SpecSearch preserves comparable reasoning quality to the large model. Experiments on both the Qwen and Llama models demonstrate that SpecSearch significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 2.12$\times$ speedup with comparable reasoning quality.

Summary:<br /><br />In this study, the researchers explore the possibility of automatically decoding open-ended reading goals from eye movements in reading. They introduce goal classification and goal reconstruction tasks and evaluation frameworks using large-scale eye tracking data in English with various text-specific information seeking tasks. Several multimodal LLMs are developed and compared, combining eye movements and text for goal classification and goal reconstruction. The experiments demonstrate significant success in both tasks, indicating that LLMs can effectively extract information about readers' text-specific goals from their eye movements. This research marks a significant advancement in understanding how reading goals can be inferred from eye movements, providing insights into readers' behavior and preferences. <div>

Abstract: When reading, we often have specific information that interests us in a text. For example, you might be reading this paper because you are curious about LLMs for eye movements in reading, the experimental design, or perhaps you only care about the question ``but does it work?''. More broadly, in daily life, people approach texts with any number of text-specific goals that guide their reading behavior. In this work, we ask, for the first time, whether open-ended reading goals can be automatically decoded from eye movements in reading. To address this question, we introduce goal classification and goal reconstruction tasks and evaluation frameworks, and use large-scale eye tracking for reading data in English with hundreds of text-specific information seeking tasks. We develop and compare several discriminative and generative multimodal LLMs that combine eye movements and text for goal classification and goal reconstruction. Our experiments show considerable success on both tasks, suggesting that LLMs can extract valuable information about the readers' text-specific goals from eye movements.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is pivotal in enhancing the robustness, reliability, and interpretability of Machine Learning (ML) systems for healthcare, optimizing resources and improving patient care. Despite the emergence of ML-based clinical decision support tools, the lack of principled quantification of uncertainty in ML models remains a major challenge. Current reviews have a narrow focus on analyzing the state-of-the-art UQ in specific healthcare domains without systematically evaluating method efficacy across different stages of model development, and despite a growing body of research, its implementation in healthcare applications remains limited. Therefore, in this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of current UQ in healthcare, offering an informed framework that highlights how different methods can be integrated into each stage of the ML pipeline including data processing, training and evaluation. We also highlight the most popular methods used in healthcare and novel approaches from other domains that hold potential for future adoption in the medical context. We expect this study will provide a clear overview of the challenges and opportunities of implementing UQ in the ML pipeline for healthcare, guiding researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable techniques to enhance the reliability, safety and trust from patients and clinicians on ML-driven healthcare solutions.

Summary:
The study addresses the issue of plant disease recognition in agriculture by proposing a collaborative inference framework between edge devices and cloud servers. Traditional manual methods are inefficient and costly, prompting the use of deep learning techniques. However, these techniques face challenges like inference delays and high energy consumption. The researchers pruned the DNN model for plant disease recognition using deep reinforcement learning to improve inference speed and reduce energy consumption. They also determined the optimal split point through a greedy strategy for optimal collaboration. The system was implemented using Gradio for user-friendly interaction. Experimental results showed that the collaborative inference framework significantly improved inference speed while maintaining acceptable accuracy, providing a novel solution for rapid plant disease diagnosis and prevention.

Abstract: Plant disease is a critical factor affecting agricultural production. Traditional manual recognition methods face significant drawbacks, including low accuracy, high costs, and inefficiency. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated significant benefits in identifying plant diseases, but they still face challenges such as inference delays and high energy consumption. Deep learning algorithms are difficult to run on resource-limited embedded devices. Offloading these models to cloud servers is confronted with the restriction of communication bandwidth, and all of these factors will influence the inference's efficiency. We propose a collaborative inference framework for recognizing plant diseases between edge devices and cloud servers to enhance inference speed. The DNN model for plant disease recognition is pruned through deep reinforcement learning to improve the inference speed and reduce energy consumption. Then the optimal split point is determined by a greedy strategy to achieve the best collaborated inference acceleration. Finally, the system for collaborative inference acceleration in plant disease recognition has been implemented using Gradio to facilitate friendly human-machine interaction. Experiments indicate that the proposed collaborative inference framework significantly increases inference speed while maintaining acceptable recognition accuracy, offering a novel solution for rapidly diagnosing and preventing plant diseases.

Continual pre-training with SwallowCode results in increased accuracy on HumanEval benchmarks, surpassing baseline models. Similarly, incorporating SwallowMath improves accuracy on mathematical datasets like GSM8K and MATH.

SwallowCode (approximately 16.1 billion tokens) refines Python snippets from The-Stack-v2 through a novel four-stage pipeline: syntax validation, pylint-based style filtering, and a two-stage LLM rewriting process that enforces style conformity and transforms snippets into self-contained, algorithmically efficient examples. Unlike prior methods that rely on exclusionary filtering or limited transformations, our transform-and-retain approach upgrades low-quality code, maximizing data utility. SwallowMath (approximately 2.3 billion tokens) enhances Finemath-4+ by removing boilerplate, restoring context, and reformatting solutions into concise, step-by-step explanations. Within a fixed 50 billion token training budget, continual pre-training of Llama-3.1-8B with SwallowCode boosts pass@1 by +17.0 on HumanEval and +17.7 on HumanEval+ compared to Stack-Edu, surpassing the baseline model's code generation capabilities. Similarly, substituting SwallowMath yields +12.4 accuracy on GSM8K and +7.6 on MATH. Ablation studies confirm that each pipeline stage contributes incrementally, with rewriting delivering the largest gains. All datasets, prompts, and checkpoints are publicly available, enabling reproducible research and advancing LLM pre-training for specialized domains.

<div> unlearning, large language models, data privacy, ethical AI deployment, DF-MCQ <br />
Summary:
This paper addresses the distinction between unlearning and obfuscation in large language models (LLMs). Current techniques for unlearning often add incorrect or irrelevant information to suppress knowledge, leaving models vulnerable to probing. The authors propose a novel unlearning method, DF-MCQ, which flattens the model predictive distribution over generated multiple-choice questions using KL-divergence to genuinely remove knowledge about target individuals. Experimental results show that DF-MCQ achieves unlearning with a refusal rate of over 90% and higher uncertainty compared to obfuscation on probing questions. This contribution highlights the importance of true removal of information for data privacy, regulatory compliance, and ethical AI deployment. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Unlearning has emerged as a critical capability for large language models (LLMs) to support data privacy, regulatory compliance, and ethical AI deployment. Recent techniques often rely on obfuscation by injecting incorrect or irrelevant information to suppress knowledge. Such methods effectively constitute knowledge addition rather than true removal, often leaving models vulnerable to probing. In this paper, we formally distinguish unlearning from obfuscation and introduce a probing-based evaluation framework to assess whether existing approaches genuinely remove targeted information. Moreover, we propose DF-MCQ, a novel unlearning method that flattens the model predictive distribution over automatically generated multiple-choice questions using KL-divergence, effectively removing knowledge about target individuals and triggering appropriate refusal behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that DF-MCQ achieves unlearning with over 90% refusal rate and a random choice-level uncertainty that is much higher than obfuscation on probing questions.

<br />Summary: Taskmaster, a British TV show blending comedy and scoring, was analyzed over 18 series and 162 episodes. Metrics like rank volatility, point spread, and winner dominance showed no significant impact on IMDb ratings, even after considering series effects. Long-term trends indicate increasing average points, slightly declining volatility, and stable rank spread. Contestants' performance styles, classified into five archetypes, appeared to influence viewer interest more than game mechanics. The show seems to maintain competitive visibility without changing its core structure. <div>

Abstract: Taskmaster is a British television show that combines comedic performance with a formal scoring system. Despite the appearance of structured competition, it remains unclear whether scoring dynamics contribute meaningfully to audience engagement. We conducted a statistical analysis of 162 episodes across 18 series, using fifteen episode-level metrics to quantify rank volatility, point spread, lead changes, and winner dominance. None of these metrics showed a significant association with IMDb ratings, even after controlling for series effects. Long-term trends suggest that average points have increased over time, while volatility has slightly declined and rank spread has remained stable. These patterns indicate an attempt to enhance competitive visibility without altering the show's structural equilibrium. We also analyzed contestant rank trajectories and identified five recurring archetypes describing performance styles. These patterns suggest that viewer interest is shaped more by contestant behavior than by game mechanics.

Abstract: Target-specific peptides, such as conotoxins, exhibit exceptional binding affinity and selectivity toward ion channels and receptors. However, their therapeutic potential remains underutilized due to the limited diversity of natural variants and the labor-intensive nature of traditional optimization strategies. Here, we present CreoPep, a deep learning-based conditional generative framework that integrates masked language modeling with a progressive masking scheme to design high-affinity peptide mutants while uncovering novel structural motifs. CreoPep employs an integrative augmentation pipeline, combining FoldX-based energy screening with temperature-controlled multinomial sampling, to generate structurally and functionally diverse peptides that retain key pharmacological properties. We validate this approach by designing conotoxin inhibitors targeting the $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, achieving submicromolar potency in electrophysiological assays. Structural analysis reveals that CreoPep-generated variants engage in both conserved and novel binding modes, including disulfide-deficient forms, thus expanding beyond conventional design paradigms. Overall, CreoPep offers a robust and generalizable platform that bridges computational peptide design with experimental validation, accelerating the discovery of next-generation peptide therapeutics.

Summary:
The article introduces the Noise-to-Meaning Recursive Self-Improvement (N2M-RSI) model, which demonstrates that an AI agent can enhance its internal complexity indefinitely by feeding its own outputs back as inputs and surpassing an information-integration threshold. This model, which is implementation-agnostic, combines concepts from self-prompting large language models, Godelian self-reference, and AutoML. The framework can be extended to interacting swarms of agents, suggesting super-linear effects when communication among instances occurs. The article includes a toy prototype in Appendix C but withholds system-specific details for safety reasons. <div>

Abstract: We present Noise-to-Meaning Recursive Self-Improvement (N2M-RSI), a minimal formal model showing that once an AI agent feeds its own outputs back as inputs and crosses an explicit information-integration threshold, its internal complexity will grow without bound under our assumptions. The framework unifies earlier ideas on self-prompting large language models, G\"odelian self-reference, and AutoML, yet remains implementation-agnostic. The model furthermore scales naturally to interacting swarms of agents, hinting at super-linear effects once communication among instances is permitted. For safety reasons, we omit system-specific implementation details and release only a brief, model-agnostic toy prototype in Appendix C.

Summary: 
The project aims to develop a machine learning system for early sepsis detection to improve patient outcomes. Existing models face challenges due to variability in patient information and population bias. To tackle this, Feature Aligned Transfer Learning (FATL) is proposed to focus on important features and combine knowledge from diverse populations. FATL ensures consistency and generalizability of the model across different clinical settings, making it a practical and scalable solution for early sepsis detection. The system has the potential to save lives, reduce healthcare costs, and support more equitable healthcare delivery.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Sepsis is a life threatening medical condition that occurs when the body has an extreme response to infection, leading to widespread inflammation, organ failure, and potentially death. Because sepsis can worsen rapidly, early detection is critical to saving lives. However, current diagnostic methods often identify sepsis only after significant damage has already occurred. Our project aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning based system to predict sepsis in its early stages, giving healthcare providers more time to intervene.
  A major problem with existing models is the wide variability in the patient information or features they use, such as heart rate, temperature, and lab results. This inconsistency makes models difficult to compare and limits their ability to work across different hospitals and settings. To solve this, we propose a method called Feature Aligned Transfer Learning (FATL), which identifies and focuses on the most important and commonly reported features across multiple studies, ensuring the model remains consistent and clinically relevant.
  Most existing models are trained on narrow patient groups, leading to population bias. FATL addresses this by combining knowledge from models trained on diverse populations, using a weighted approach that reflects each models contribution. This makes the system more generalizable and effective across different patient demographics and clinical environments. FATL offers a practical and scalable solution for early sepsis detection, particularly in hospitals with limited resources, and has the potential to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and support more equitable healthcare delivery.

<title>The Art of Repair: Optimizing Iterative Program Repair with Instruction-Tuned Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02931</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02931</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic program repair (APR) aims to reduce the manual efforts required to identify and fix errors in source code. Before the rise of LLM-based agents, a common strategy was to increase the number of generated patches, sometimes to the thousands, to achieve better repair results on benchmarks. More recently, self-iterative capabilities enabled LLMs to refine patches over multiple rounds guided by feedback. However, literature often focuses on many iterations and disregards different numbers of outputs.
  We investigate an APR pipeline that balances these two approaches, the generation of multiple outputs and multiple rounds of iteration, while imposing a limit of 10 total patches per bug. We apply three SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs - DeepSeekCoder-Instruct, Codellama-Instruct, Llama3.1-Instruct - to the APR task. We further fine-tune each model on an APR dataset with three sizes (1K, 30K, 65K) and two techniques (Full Fine-Tuning and LoRA), allowing us to assess their repair capabilities on two APR benchmarks: HumanEval-Java and Defects4J.
  Our results show that by using only a fraction (<1%) of the fine-tuning dataset, we can achieve improvements of up to 78% in the number of plausible patches generated, challenging prior studies that reported limited gains using Full Fine-Tuning. However, we find that exceeding certain thresholds leads to diminishing outcomes, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, we show that base models greatly benefit from creating patches in an iterative fashion rather than generating them all at once. In addition, the benefit of iterative strategies becomes more pronounced in complex benchmarks. Even fine-tuned models, while benefiting less from iterations, still gain advantages, particularly on complex benchmarks. The research underscores the need for balanced APR strategies that combine multi-output generation and iterative refinement.

Abstract: A key challenge in multi-agent AI is modeling social cooperation under realistic behavioral constraints. Many foundational concepts in economics and ethics such as "trust" or "morality" are often defined informally, without operational criteria or cognitive grounding, which limits their testability and implementation in artificial agents. Drawing on converging empirical evidence from primate behavior, infant cognition, and economic anthropology, we propose a conceptual framework composed of three cognitively minimal mechanisms: individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost return sensitivity. This framework reframes trust as a graded cognitive expectation, providing a simulateable basis for reciprocal exchange in artificial agents, and enabling the bottom-up emergence of scalable cooperation and institutional dynamics.

Abstract: Turning static slides into engaging video lectures takes considerable time and effort, requiring presenters to record explanations and visually guide their audience through the material. We introduce an end-to-end system designed to automate this process entirely. Given a slide deck, this system synthesizes a video lecture featuring AI-generated narration synchronized precisely with dynamic visual highlights. These highlights automatically draw attention to the specific concept being discussed, much like an effective presenter would. The core technical contribution is a novel highlight alignment module. This module accurately maps spoken phrases to locations on a given slide using diverse strategies (e.g., Levenshtein distance, LLM-based semantic analysis) at selectable granularities (line or word level) and utilizes timestamp-providing Text-to-Speech (TTS) for timing synchronization. We demonstrate the system's effectiveness through a technical evaluation using a manually annotated slide dataset with 1000 samples, finding that LLM-based alignment achieves high location accuracy (F1 > 92%), significantly outperforming simpler methods, especially on complex, math-heavy content. Furthermore, the calculated generation cost averages under $1 per hour of video, offering potential savings of two orders of magnitude compared to conservative estimates of manual production costs. This combination of high accuracy and extremely low cost positions this approach as a practical and scalable tool for transforming static slides into effective, visually-guided video lectures.

Abstract: We present Rapid Attention Distillation to Linear Attention Decoders at Scale (RADLADS), a protocol for rapidly converting softmax attention transformers into linear attention decoder models, along with two new RWKV-variant architectures, and models converted from popular Qwen2.5 open source models in 7B, 32B, and 72B sizes. Our conversion process requires only 350-700M tokens, less than 0.005% of the token count used to train the original teacher models. Converting to our 72B linear attention model costs less than \$2,000 USD at today's prices, yet quality at inference remains close to the original transformer. These models achieve state-of-the-art downstream performance across a set of standard benchmarks for linear attention models of their size. We release all our models on HuggingFace under the Apache 2.0 license, with the exception of our 72B models which are also governed by the Qwen License Agreement.

Abstract: Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) is a dual-energy mammographic technique that improves lesion visibility through the administration of an iodinated contrast agent. It acquires both a low-energy image, comparable to standard mammography, and a high-energy image, which are then combined to produce a dual-energy subtracted image highlighting lesion contrast enhancement. While CESM offers superior diagnostic accuracy compared to standard mammography, its use entails higher radiation exposure and potential side effects associated with the contrast medium. To address these limitations, we propose Seg-CycleGAN, a generative deep learning framework for Virtual Contrast Enhancement in CESM. The model synthesizes high-fidelity dual-energy subtracted images from low-energy images, leveraging lesion segmentation maps to guide the generative process and improve lesion reconstruction. Building upon the standard CycleGAN architecture, Seg-CycleGAN introduces localized loss terms focused on lesion areas, enhancing the synthesis of diagnostically relevant regions. Experiments on the CESM@UCBM dataset demonstrate that Seg-CycleGAN outperforms the baseline in terms of PSNR and SSIM, while maintaining competitive MSE and VIF. Qualitative evaluations further confirm improved lesion fidelity in the generated images. These results suggest that segmentation-aware generative models offer a viable pathway toward contrast-free CESM alternatives.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance through training on massive datasets, they can exhibit concerning behaviors such as verbatim reproduction of training data rather than true generalization. This memorization phenomenon raises significant concerns about data privacy, intellectual property rights, and the reliability of model evaluations. This paper introduces PEARL, a novel approach for detecting memorization in LLMs. PEARL assesses how sensitive an LLM's performance is to input perturbations, enabling memorization detection without requiring access to the model's internals. We investigate how input perturbations affect the consistency of outputs, enabling us to distinguish between true generalization and memorization. Our findings, following extensive experiments on the Pythia open model, provide a robust framework for identifying when the model simply regurgitates learned information. Applied on the GPT 4o models, the PEARL framework not only identified cases of memorization of classic texts from the Bible or common code from HumanEval but also demonstrated that it can provide supporting evidence that some data, such as from the New York Times news articles, were likely part of the training data of a given model.

Abstract: Synthetic data sets are used across linguistic domains and NLP tasks, particularly in scenarios where authentic data is limited (or even non-existent). One such domain is that of clinical (healthcare) contexts, where there exist significant and long-standing challenges (e.g., privacy, anonymization, and data governance) which have led to the development of an increasing number of synthetic datasets. One increasingly important category of clinical dataset is that of clinical dialogues which are especially sensitive and difficult to collect, and as such are commonly synthesized.
  While such synthetic datasets have been shown to be sufficient in some situations, little theory exists to inform how they may be best used and generalized to new applications. In this paper, we provide an overview of how synthetic datasets are created, evaluated and being used for dialogue related tasks in the medical domain. Additionally, we propose a novel typology for use in classifying types and degrees of data synthesis, to facilitate comparison and evaluation.

Abstract: Autonomous long-horizon mobile manipulation encompasses a multitude of challenges, including scene dynamics, unexplored areas, and error recovery. Recent works have leveraged foundation models for scene-level robotic reasoning and planning. However, the performance of these methods degrades when dealing with a large number of objects and large-scale environments. To address these limitations, we propose MORE, a novel approach for enhancing the capabilities of language models to solve zero-shot mobile manipulation planning for rearrangement tasks. MORE leverages scene graphs to represent environments, incorporates instance differentiation, and introduces an active filtering scheme that extracts task-relevant subgraphs of object and region instances. These steps yield a bounded planning problem, effectively mitigating hallucinations and improving reliability. Additionally, we introduce several enhancements that enable planning across both indoor and outdoor environments. We evaluate MORE on 81 diverse rearrangement tasks from the BEHAVIOR-1K benchmark, where it becomes the first approach to successfully solve a significant share of the benchmark, outperforming recent foundation model-based approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities of our approach in several complex real-world tasks, mimicking everyday activities. We make the code publicly available at https://more-model.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: LLM evaluation is challenging even the case of base models. In real world deployments, evaluation is further complicated by the interplay of task specific prompts and experiential context. At scale, bias evaluation is often based on short context, fixed choice benchmarks that can be rapidly evaluated, however, these can lose validity when the LLMs' deployed context differs. Large scale human evaluation is often seen as too intractable and costly. Here we present our journey towards developing a semi-automated bias evaluation framework for free text responses that has human insights at its core. We discuss how we developed an operational definition of bias that helped us automate our pipeline and a methodology for classifying bias beyond multiple choice. We additionally comment on how human evaluation helped us uncover problematic templates in a bias benchmark.

Abstract: This paper presents Latent Adaptive Planner (LAP), a novel approach for dynamic nonprehensile manipulation tasks that formulates planning as latent space inference, effectively learned from human demonstration videos. Our method addresses key challenges in visuomotor policy learning through a principled variational replanning framework that maintains temporal consistency while efficiently adapting to environmental changes. LAP employs Bayesian updating in latent space to incrementally refine plans as new observations become available, striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and real-time adaptability. We bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots through model-based proportional mapping that regenerates accurate kinematic-dynamic joint states and object positions from human demonstrations. Experimental evaluations across multiple complex manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that LAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches in success rate, trajectory smoothness, and energy efficiency, particularly in dynamic adaptation scenarios. Our approach enables robots to perform complex interactions with human-like adaptability while providing an expandable framework applicable to diverse robotic platforms using the same human demonstration videos.

Abstract: This study explores the application of chaos engineering to enhance the robustness of Large Language Model-Based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) in production-like environments under real-world conditions. LLM-MAS can potentially improve a wide range of tasks, from answering questions and generating content to automating customer support and improving decision-making processes. However, LLM-MAS in production or preproduction environments can be vulnerable to emergent errors or disruptions, such as hallucinations, agent failures, and agent communication failures. This study proposes a chaos engineering framework to proactively identify such vulnerabilities in LLM-MAS, assess and build resilience against them, and ensure reliable performance in critical applications.

Abstract: Scientific knowledge creation is fundamentally transforming as humans and AI systems evolve beyond tool-user relationships into co-evolutionary epistemic partnerships. When AlphaFold revolutionized protein structure prediction, researchers described engaging with an epistemic partner that reshaped how they conceptualized fundamental relationships. This article introduces Cognitio Emergens (CE), a framework addressing critical limitations in existing models that focus on static roles or narrow metrics while failing to capture how scientific understanding emerges through recursive human-AI interaction over time. CE integrates three components addressing these limitations: Agency Configurations describing how authority distributes between humans and AI (Directed, Contributory, Partnership), with partnerships dynamically oscillating between configurations rather than following linear progression; Epistemic Dimensions capturing six specific capabilities emerging through collaboration across Discovery, Integration, and Projection axes, creating distinctive "capability signatures" that guide development; and Partnership Dynamics identifying forces shaping how these relationships evolve, particularly the risk of epistemic alienation where researchers lose interpretive control over knowledge they formally endorse. Drawing from autopoiesis theory, social systems theory, and organizational modularity, CE reveals how knowledge co-creation emerges through continuous negotiation of roles, values, and organizational structures. By reconceptualizing human-AI scientific collaboration as fundamentally co-evolutionary, CE offers a balanced perspective that neither uncritically celebrates nor unnecessarily fears AI's evolving role, instead providing conceptual tools for cultivating partnerships that maintain meaningful human participation while enabling transformative scientific breakthroughs.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning models require rigorous evaluation before deployment, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving and surveillance. The evaluation of machine learning models often focuses on data slices, which are subsets of the data that share a set of characteristics. Data slice finding automatically identifies conditions or data subgroups where models underperform, aiding developers in mitigating performance issues. Despite its popularity and effectiveness, data slicing for vision model validation faces several challenges. First, data slicing often needs additional image metadata or visual concepts, and falls short in certain computer vision tasks, such as object detection. Second, understanding data slices is a labor-intensive and mentally demanding process that heavily relies on the expert's domain knowledge. Third, data slicing lacks a human-in-the-loop solution that allows experts to form hypothesis and test them interactively. To overcome these limitations and better support the machine learning operations lifecycle, we introduce VISLIX, a novel visual analytics framework that employs state-of-the-art foundation models to help domain experts analyze slices in computer vision models. Our approach does not require image metadata or visual concepts, automatically generates natural language insights, and allows users to test data slice hypothesis interactively. We evaluate VISLIX with an expert study and three use cases, that demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool in providing comprehensive insights for validating object detection models.

Abstract: We introduce an unsupervised motion-compensated image reconstruction algorithm for free-breathing and ungated 3D cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We express the image volume corresponding to each specific motion phase as the deformation of a single static image template. The main contribution of the work is the low-rank model for the compact joint representation of the family of diffeomorphisms, parameterized by the motion phases. The diffeomorphism at a specific motion phase is obtained by integrating a parametric velocity field along a path connecting the reference template phase to the motion phase. The velocity field at different phases is represented using a low-rank model. The static template and the low-rank motion model parameters are learned directly from the k-space data in an unsupervised fashion. The more constrained motion model is observed to offer improved recovery compared to current motion-resolved and motion-compensated algorithms for free-breathing 3D cine MRI.

<title>StableMotion: Training Motion Cleanup Models with Unpaired Corrupted Data</title>

Abstract: Motion capture (mocap) data often exhibits visually jarring artifacts due to inaccurate sensors and post-processing. Cleaning this corrupted data can require substantial manual effort from human experts, which can be a costly and time-consuming process. Previous data-driven motion cleanup methods offer the promise of automating this cleanup process, but often require in-domain paired corrupted-to-clean training data. Constructing such paired datasets requires access to high-quality, relatively artifact-free motion clips, which often necessitates laborious manual cleanup. In this work, we present StableMotion, a simple yet effective method for training motion cleanup models directly from unpaired corrupted datasets that need cleanup. The core component of our method is the introduction of motion quality indicators, which can be easily annotated through manual labeling or heuristic algorithms and enable training of quality-aware motion generation models on raw motion data with mixed quality. At test time, the model can be prompted to generate high-quality motions using the quality indicators. Our method can be implemented through a simple diffusion-based framework, leading to a unified motion generate-discriminate model, which can be used to both identify and fix corrupted frames. We demonstrate that our proposed method is effective for training motion cleanup models on raw mocap data in production scenarios by applying StableMotion to SoccerMocap, a 245-hour soccer mocap dataset containing real-world motion artifacts. The trained model effectively corrects a wide range of motion artifacts, reducing motion pops and frozen frames by 68% and 81%, respectively. See https://youtu.be/3Y7MMAH02B4 for more results.

Abstract: Best-of-$n$ (BoN) sampling is a practical approach for aligning language model outputs with human preferences without expensive fine-tuning. BoN sampling is performed by generating $n$ responses to a prompt and then selecting the sample that maximizes a reward function. BoN yields high reward values in practice at a distortion cost, as measured by the KL-divergence between the sampled and original distribution. This distortion is coarsely controlled by varying the number of samples: larger $n$ yields a higher reward at a higher distortion cost. We introduce Soft Best-of-$n$ sampling, a generalization of BoN that allows for smooth interpolation between the original distribution and reward-maximizing distribution through a temperature parameter $\lambda$. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that Soft Best-of-$n$ sampling converges sharply to the optimal tilted distribution at a rate of $O(1/n)$ in KL and the expected (relative) reward. For sequences of discrete outputs, we analyze an additive reward model that reveals the fundamental limitations of blockwise sampling.

<title>Null Counterfactual Factor Interactions for Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Hindsight relabeling is a powerful tool for overcoming sparsity in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL), especially in certain domains such as navigation and locomotion. However, hindsight relabeling can struggle in object-centric domains. For example, suppose that the goal space consists of a robotic arm pushing a particular target block to a goal location. In this case, hindsight relabeling will give high rewards to any trajectory that does not interact with the block. However, these behaviors are only useful when the object is already at the goal -- an extremely rare case in practice. A dataset dominated by these kinds of trajectories can complicate learning and lead to failures. In object-centric domains, one key intuition is that meaningful trajectories are often characterized by object-object interactions such as pushing the block with the gripper. To leverage this intuition, we introduce Hindsight Relabeling using Interactions (HInt), which combines interactions with hindsight relabeling to improve the sample efficiency of downstream RL. However because interactions do not have a consensus statistical definition tractable for downstream GCRL, we propose a definition of interactions based on the concept of null counterfactual: a cause object is interacting with a target object if, in a world where the cause object did not exist, the target object would have different transition dynamics. We leverage this definition to infer interactions in Null Counterfactual Interaction Inference (NCII), which uses a "nulling'' operation with a learned model to infer interactions. NCII is able to achieve significantly improved interaction inference accuracy in both simple linear dynamics domains and dynamic robotic domains in Robosuite, Robot Air Hockey, and Franka Kitchen and HInt improves sample efficiency by up to 4x.

Abstract: Comprehending long videos remains a significant challenge for Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs). Current LMMs struggle to process even minutes to hours videos due to their lack of explicit memory and retrieval mechanisms. To address this limitation, we propose RAVU (Retrieval Augmented Video Understanding), a novel framework for video understanding enhanced by retrieval with compositional reasoning over a spatio-temporal graph. We construct a graph representation of the video, capturing both spatial and temporal relationships between entities. This graph serves as a long-term memory, allowing us to track objects and their actions across time. To answer complex queries, we decompose the queries into a sequence of reasoning steps and execute these steps on the graph, retrieving relevant key information. Our approach enables more accurate understanding of long videos, particularly for queries that require multi-hop reasoning and tracking objects across frames. Our approach demonstrate superior performances with limited retrieved frames (5-10) compared with other SOTA methods and baselines on two major video QA datasets, NExT-QA and EgoSchema.

<title>seq-JEPA: Autoregressive Predictive Learning of Invariant-Equivariant World Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03176</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.03176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current self-supervised algorithms mostly rely on transformations such as data augmentation and masking to learn visual representations. This is achieved by inducing invariance or equivariance with respect to these transformations after encoding two views of an image. This dominant two-view paradigm can limit the flexibility of learned representations for downstream adaptation by creating performance trade-offs between invariance-related tasks such as image classification and more fine-grained equivariance-related tasks. In this work, we introduce \emph{seq-JEPA}, a world modeling paradigm based on joint-embedding predictive architecture that leverages architectural inductive biases to resolve this trade-off. Without requiring an additional equivariance predictor or loss term, seq-JEPA simultaneously learns two architecturally segregated representations: one equivariant to the specified transformations and another invariant to them and suited for tasks such as classification. To do so, our model processes a short sequence of different views (observations) of an input image. Each encoded view is concatenated with embeddings corresponding to the relative transformation (action) producing the next observation in the sequence. A transformer encoder outputs an aggregate representation of this sequence, which is subsequently conditioned on the action leading to the next observation to predict its representation. Empirically, seq-JEPA achieves strong performance on equivariant benchmarks and image classification without sacrificing one for the other. Additionally, our framework excels at tasks that inherently require aggregating a sequence of observations, such as path integration across actions and predictive learning across eye movements.

Abstract: With the rise of short video platforms in global communication, embedding steganographic data in audio synchronization streams has emerged as a new covert communication method. To address the limitations of traditional techniques in detecting synchronized steganography, this paper proposes a detection and distributed guidance reconstruction model based on short video "Yupan" samples released by China's South Sea Fleet on TikTok. The method integrates sliding spectrum feature extraction and intelligent inference mechanisms. A 25 ms sliding window with short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used to extract the main frequency trajectory and construct the synchronization frame detection model (M1), identifying a frame flag "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF80". The subsequent 32-byte payload is decoded by a structured model (M2) to infer distributed guidance commands. Analysis reveals a low-entropy, repetitive byte sequence in the 36 to 45 second audio segment with highly concentrated spectral energy, confirming the presence of synchronization frames. Although plaintext semantics are not restored, the consistency in command field layout suggests features of military communication protocols. The multi-segment splicing model further shows cross-video embedding and centralized decoding capabilities. The proposed framework validates the effectiveness of sliding spectral features for synchronized steganography detection and builds an extensible inference model for covert communication analysis and tactical guidance simulation on open platforms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong potential across a variety of tasks in communications and networking due to their advanced reasoning capabilities. However, because different LLMs have different model structures and are trained using distinct corpora and methods, they may offer varying optimization strategies for the same network issues. Moreover, the limitations of an individual LLM's training data, aggravated by the potential maliciousness of its hosting device, can result in responses with low confidence or even bias. To address these challenges, we propose a blockchain-enabled collaborative framework that connects multiple LLMs into a Trustworthy Multi-LLM Network (MultiLLMN). This architecture enables the cooperative evaluation and selection of the most reliable and high-quality responses to complex network optimization problems. Specifically, we begin by reviewing related work and highlighting the limitations of existing LLMs in collaboration and trust, emphasizing the need for trustworthiness in LLM-based systems. We then introduce the workflow and design of the proposed Trustworthy MultiLLMN framework. Given the severity of False Base Station (FBS) attacks in B5G and 6G communication systems and the difficulty of addressing such threats through traditional modeling techniques, we present FBS defense as a case study to empirically validate the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we outline promising future research directions in this emerging area.

Abstract: Acquiring structured data from domain-specific, image-based documents such as scanned reports is crucial for many downstream tasks but remains challenging due to document variability. Many of these documents exist as images rather than as machine-readable text, which requires human annotation to train automated extraction systems. We present DocSpiral, the first Human-in-the-Spiral assistive document annotation platform, designed to address the challenge of extracting structured information from domain-specific, image-based document collections. Our spiral design establishes an iterative cycle in which human annotations train models that progressively require less manual intervention. DocSpiral integrates document format normalization, comprehensive annotation interfaces, evaluation metrics dashboard, and API endpoints for the development of AI / ML models into a unified workflow. Experiments demonstrate that our framework reduces annotation time by at least 41\% while showing consistent performance gains across three iterations during model training. By making this annotation platform freely accessible, we aim to lower barriers to AI/ML models development in document processing, facilitating the adoption of large language models in image-based, document-intensive fields such as geoscience and healthcare. The system is freely available at: https://app.ai4wa.com. The demonstration video is available: https://app.ai4wa.com/docs/docspiral/demo.

Abstract: This study introduces an innovative crossover operator named Particle Swarm Optimization-inspired Crossover (PSOX), which is specifically developed for real-coded genetic algorithms. Departing from conventional crossover approaches that only exchange information between individuals within the same generation, PSOX uniquely incorporates guidance from both the current global best solution and historical optimal solutions across multiple generations. This novel mechanism enables the algorithm to maintain population diversity while simultaneously accelerating convergence toward promising regions of the search space. The effectiveness of PSOX is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments on 15 benchmark test functions with diverse characteristics, including unimodal, multimodal, and highly complex landscapes. Comparative analysis against five state-of-the-art crossover operators reveals that PSOX consistently delivers superior performance in terms of solution accuracy, algorithmic stability, and convergence speed, especially when combined with an appropriate mutation strategy. Furthermore, the study provides an in-depth investigation of how different mutation rates influence PSOX's performance, yielding practical guidelines for parameter tuning when addressing optimization problems with varying landscape properties.

Abstract: Natural language goes beyond dryly describing visual content. It contains rich abstract concepts to express feeling, creativity and properties that cannot be directly perceived. Yet, current research in Vision Language Models (VLMs) has not shed light on abstract-oriented language. Our research breaks new ground by uncovering its wide presence and under-estimated value, with extensive analysis. Particularly, we focus our investigation on the fashion domain, a highly-representative field with abstract expressions. By analyzing recent large-scale multimodal fashion datasets, we find that abstract terms have a dominant presence, rivaling the concrete ones, providing novel information, and being useful in the retrieval task. However, a critical challenge emerges: current general-purpose or fashion-specific VLMs are pre-trained with databases that lack sufficient abstract words in their text corpora, thus hindering their ability to effectively represent abstract-oriented language. We propose a training-free and model-agnostic method, Abstract-to-Concrete Translator (ACT), to shift abstract representations towards well-represented concrete ones in the VLM latent space, using pre-trained models and existing multimodal databases. On the text-to-image retrieval task, despite being training-free, ACT outperforms the fine-tuned VLMs in both same- and cross-dataset settings, exhibiting its effectiveness with a strong generalization capability. Moreover, the improvement introduced by ACT is consistent with various VLMs, making it a plug-and-play solution.

Abstract: While modern Requirements Engineering (RE) heavily relies on natural language processing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, their effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of high-quality datasets. This paper introduces Synthline, a Product Line (PL) approach that leverages Large Language Models to systematically generate synthetic RE data for classification-based use cases. Through an empirical evaluation conducted in the context of using ML for the identification of requirements specification defects, we investigated both the diversity of the generated data and its utility for training downstream models. Our analysis reveals that while synthetic datasets exhibit less diversity than real data, they are good enough to serve as viable training resources. Moreover, our evaluation shows that combining synthetic and real data leads to substantial performance improvements. Specifically, hybrid approaches achieve up to 85% improvement in precision and a 2x increase in recall compared to models trained exclusively on real data. These findings demonstrate the potential of PL-based synthetic data generation to address data scarcity in RE. We make both our implementation and generated datasets publicly available to support reproducibility and advancement in the field.

Abstract: Recently, the superior performance of Transformers has made them a more robust and scalable solution for sequence modeling than traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, the effectiveness of Transformer in capturing long-term dependencies is primarily attributed to their comprehensive pair-modeling process rather than inherent inductive biases toward sequence semantics. In this study, we explore the capabilities of pure RNNs and reassess their long-term learning mechanisms. Inspired by the physics energy transition models that track energy changes over time, we propose a effective recurrent structure called the``Physics-inspired Energy Transition Neural Network" (PETNN). We demonstrate that PETNN's memory mechanism effectively stores information over long-term dependencies. Experimental results indicate that PETNN outperforms transformer-based methods across various sequence tasks. Furthermore, owing to its recurrent nature, PETNN exhibits significantly lower complexity. Our study presents an optimal foundational recurrent architecture and highlights the potential for developing effective recurrent neural networks in fields currently dominated by Transformer.

Abstract: We present Mixture of Discrete-time Gaussian Processes (MiDiGap), a novel approach for flexible policy representation and imitation learning in robot manipulation. MiDiGap enables learning from as few as five demonstrations using only camera observations and generalizes across a wide range of challenging tasks. It excels at long-horizon behaviors such as making coffee, highly constrained motions such as opening doors, dynamic actions such as scooping with a spatula, and multimodal tasks such as hanging a mug. MiDiGap learns these tasks on a CPU in less than a minute and scales linearly to large datasets. We also develop a rich suite of tools for inference-time steering using evidence such as collision signals and robot kinematic constraints. This steering enables novel generalization capabilities, including obstacle avoidance and cross-embodiment policy transfer. MiDiGap achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse few-shot manipulation benchmarks. On constrained RLBench tasks, it improves policy success by 76 percentage points and reduces trajectory cost by 67%. On multimodal tasks, it improves policy success by 48 percentage points and increases sample efficiency by a factor of 20. In cross-embodiment transfer, it more than doubles policy success. We make the code publicly available at https://midigap.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: Foundation models constitute a significant advancement in computer vision: after a single, albeit costly, training phase, they can address a wide array of tasks. In the field of Earth observation, over 75 remote sensing vision foundation models have been developed in the past four years. However, none has consistently outperformed the others across all available downstream tasks. To facilitate their comparison, we propose a cost-effective method for predicting a model's performance on multiple downstream tasks without the need for fine-tuning on each one. This method is based on what we call "capabilities encoding." The utility of this novel approach is twofold: we demonstrate its potential to simplify the selection of a foundation model for a given new task, and we employ it to offer a fresh perspective on the existing literature, suggesting avenues for future research. Codes are available at https://github.com/pierreadorni/capabilities-encoding.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of lightweight deep learning models for image classification, emphasizing their suitability for deployment in resource-constrained environments such as low-memory devices. Five state-of-the-art architectures - MobileNetV3 Small, ResNet18, SqueezeNet, EfficientNetV2-S, and ShuffleNetV2 - are benchmarked across three diverse datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet. The models are assessed using four key performance metrics: classification accuracy, inference time, floating-point operations (FLOPs), and model size. Additionally, we investigate the impact of hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, and training paradigms by comparing pretrained models with scratch-trained counterparts, focusing on MobileNetV3 Small. Our findings reveal that transfer learning significantly enhances model accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly for complex datasets like Tiny ImageNet. EfficientNetV2 consistently achieves the highest accuracy, while MobileNetV3 offers the best balance between accuracy and efficiency, and SqueezeNet excels in inference speed and compactness. This study highlights critical trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, offering actionable insights for deploying lightweight models in real-world applications where computational resources are limited. By addressing these challenges, this research contributes to optimizing deep learning systems for edge computing and mobile platforms.

Abstract: The recent surge in the popularity of diffusion models for image synthesis has attracted new attention to their potential for generation tasks in other domains. However, their applications to symbolic music generation remain largely under-explored because symbolic music is typically represented as sequences of discrete events and standard diffusion models are not well-suited for discrete data. We represent symbolic music as image-like pianorolls, facilitating the use of diffusion models for the generation of symbolic music. Moreover, this study introduces a novel diffusion model that incorporates our proposed Transformer-Mamba block and learnable wavelet transform. Classifier-free guidance is utilised to generate symbolic music with target chords. Our evaluation shows that our method achieves compelling results in terms of music quality and controllability, outperforming the strong baseline in pianoroll generation.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the task of script-driven video summarization, which aims to produce a summary of the full-length video by selecting the parts that are most relevant to a user-provided script outlining the visual content of the desired summary. Following, we extend a recently-introduced large-scale dataset for generic video summarization (VideoXum) by producing natural language descriptions of the different human-annotated summaries that are available per video. In this way we make it compatible with the introduced task, since the available triplets of ``video, summary and summary description'' can be used for training a method that is able to produce different summaries for a given video, driven by the provided script about the content of each summary. Finally, we develop a new network architecture for script-driven video summarization (SD-VSum), that relies on the use of a cross-modal attention mechanism for aligning and fusing information from the visual and text modalities. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the advanced performance of SD-VSum against state-of-the-art approaches for query-driven and generic (unimodal and multimodal) summarization from the literature, and document its capacity to produce video summaries that are adapted to each user's needs about their content.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown encouraging capabilities for mapping accurately forests at medium resolution with TanDEM-X interferometric SAR data. Such models, as most of current state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in remote sensing, are trained in a fully-supervised way, which requires a large amount of labeled data for training and validation. In this work, our aim is to exploit the high-resolution capabilities of the TanDEM-X mission to map forests at 6 m. The goal is to overcome the intrinsic limitations posed by midresolution products, which affect, e.g., the detection of narrow roads within vegetated areas and the precise delineation of forested regions contours. To cope with the lack of extended reliable reference datasets at such a high resolution, we investigate self-supervised learning techniques for extracting highly informative representations from the input features, followed by a supervised training step with a significantly smaller number of reliable labels. A 1 m resolution forest/non-forest reference map over Pennsylvania, USA, allows for comparing different training approaches for the development of an effective forest mapping framework with limited labeled samples. We select the best-performing approach over this test region and apply it in a real-case forest mapping scenario over the Amazon rainforest, where only very few labeled data at high resolution are available. In this challenging scenario, the proposed self-supervised framework significantly enhances the classification accuracy with respect to fully-supervised methods, trained using the same amount of labeled data, representing an extremely promising starting point for large-scale, very high-resolution forest mapping with TanDEM-X data.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models by learning directly from outcome-based rewards. Recent RLVR works that operate under the zero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still depend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training. The scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the long-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already evident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a hypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by humans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To address these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in which a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any external data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability by using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and verify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide open-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without external data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens of thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is compatible with various model classes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for generative recommender systems due to their transformative capabilities in user interaction. However, ensuring they do not recommend out-of-domain (OOD) items remains a challenge. We study two distinct methods to address this issue: RecLM-ret, a retrieval-based method, and RecLM-cgen, a constrained generation method. Both methods integrate seamlessly with existing LLMs to ensure in-domain recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on three recommendation datasets demonstrate that RecLM-cgen consistently outperforms RecLM-ret and existing LLM-based recommender models in accuracy while eliminating OOD recommendations, making it the preferred method for adoption. Additionally, RecLM-cgen maintains strong generalist capabilities and is a lightweight plug-and-play module for easy integration into LLMs, offering valuable practical benefits for the community.

Abstract: Visual Generative AI models have demonstrated remarkable capability in generating high-quality images from simple inputs like text prompts. However, because these models are trained on images from diverse sources, they risk memorizing and reproducing specific content, raising concerns about intellectual property (IP) infringement. Recent advances in prompt engineering offer a cost-effective way to enhance generative AI performance. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of prompt engineering techniques in mitigating IP infringement risks in image generation. Our findings show that Chain of Thought Prompting and Task Instruction Prompting significantly reduce the similarity between generated images and the training data of diffusion models, thereby lowering the risk of IP infringement.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by their substantial computational and memory demands. While structured pruning presents a viable approach by eliminating entire network components, existing methods suffer from performance degradation, reliance on heuristic metrics, or expensive finetuning. To address these challenges, we propose SPAP (Structured Pruning via Alternating Optimization and Penalty Methods), a novel and efficient structured pruning framework for LLMs grounded in optimization theory. SPAP formulates the pruning problem through a mixed-integer optimization model, employs a penalty method that effectively makes pruning decisions to minimize pruning errors, and introduces an alternating minimization algorithm tailored to the splittable problem structure for efficient weight updates and performance recovery. Extensive experiments on OPT, LLaMA-3/3.1/3.2, and Qwen2.5 models demonstrate SPAP's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, delivering linear inference speedups (1.29$\times$ at 30% sparsity) and proportional memory reductions. Our work offers a practical, optimization-driven solution for pruning LLMs while preserving model performance.

Abstract: Medical AI assistants support doctors in disease diagnosis, medical image analysis, and report generation. However, they still face significant challenges in clinical use, including limited accuracy with multimodal content and insufficient validation in real-world settings. We propose RCMed, a full-stack AI assistant that improves multimodal alignment in both input and output, enabling precise anatomical delineation, accurate localization, and reliable diagnosis through hierarchical vision-language grounding. A self-reinforcing correlation mechanism allows visual features to inform language context, while language semantics guide pixel-wise attention, forming a closed loop that refines both modalities. This correlation is enhanced by a color region description strategy, translating anatomical structures into semantically rich text to learn shape-location-text relationships across scales. Trained on 20 million image-mask-description triplets, RCMed achieves state-of-the-art precision in contextualizing irregular lesions and subtle anatomical boundaries, excelling in 165 clinical tasks across 9 modalities. It achieved a 23.5% relative improvement in cell segmentation from microscopy images over prior methods. RCMed's strong vision-language alignment enables exceptional generalization, with state-of-the-art performance in external validation across 20 clinically significant cancer types, including novel tasks. This work demonstrates how integrated multimodal models capture fine-grained patterns, enabling human-level interpretation in complex scenarios and advancing human-centric AI healthcare.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have recently been employed to determine whether a specific text was part of the pre-training data of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods often misinfer non-members as members, leading to a high false positive rate, or depend on additional reference models for probability calibration, which limits their practicality. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel framework called Automatic Calibration Membership Inference Attack (ACMIA), which utilizes a tunable temperature to calibrate output probabilities effectively. This approach is inspired by our theoretical insights into maximum likelihood estimation during the pre-training of LLMs. We introduce ACMIA in three configurations designed to accommodate different levels of model access and increase the probability gap between members and non-members, improving the reliability and robustness of membership inference. Extensive experiments on various open-source LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attack is highly effective, robust, and generalizable, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines across three widely used benchmarks. Our code is available at: \href{https://github.com/Salehzz/ACMIA}{\textcolor{blue}{Github}}.

<title>DDaTR: Dynamic Difference-aware Temporal Residual Network for Longitudinal Radiology Report Generation</title>

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) automates the creation of radiology reports from medical imaging, enhancing the efficiency of the reporting process. Longitudinal Radiology Report Generation (LRRG) extends RRG by incorporating the ability to compare current and prior exams, facilitating the tracking of temporal changes in clinical findings. Existing LRRG approaches only extract features from prior and current images using a visual pre-trained encoder, which are then concatenated to generate the final report. However, these methods struggle to effectively capture both spatial and temporal correlations during the feature extraction process. Consequently, the extracted features inadequately capture the information of difference across exams and thus underrepresent the expected progressions, leading to sub-optimal performance in LRRG. To address this, we develop a novel dynamic difference-aware temporal residual network (DDaTR). In DDaTR, we introduce two modules at each stage of the visual encoder to capture multi-level spatial correlations. The Dynamic Feature Alignment Module (DFAM) is designed to align prior features across modalities for the integrity of prior clinical information. Prompted by the enriched prior features, the dynamic difference-aware module (DDAM) captures favorable difference information by identifying relationships across exams. Furthermore, our DDaTR employs the dynamic residual network to unidirectionally transmit longitudinal information, effectively modelling temporal correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on three benchmarks, proving its efficacy in both RRG and LRRG tasks.

Abstract: This research paper investigates the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare, specifically focusing on enhancing medical decision support through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrated with hospital-specific data and fine-tuning using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA). The system utilizes Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct as its foundation model. By embedding and retrieving context-relevant healthcare information, the system significantly improves response accuracy. QLoRA facilitates notable parameter efficiency and memory optimization, preserving the integrity of medical information through specialized quantization techniques. Our research also shows that our model performs relatively well on various medical benchmarks, indicating that it can be used to make basic medical suggestions. This paper details the system's technical components, including its architecture, quantization methods, and key healthcare applications such as enhanced disease prediction from patient symptoms and medical history, treatment suggestions, and efficient summarization of complex medical reports. We touch on the ethical considerations-patient privacy, data security, and the need for rigorous clinical validation-as well as the practical challenges of integrating such systems into real-world healthcare workflows. Furthermore, the lightweight quantized weights ensure scalability and ease of deployment even in low-resource hospital environments. Finally, the paper concludes with an analysis of the broader impact of LLMs on healthcare and outlines future directions for LLMs in medical settings.

Abstract: The growing need for Trusted AI (TAI) highlights the importance of interpretability and robustness in machine learning models. However, many existing tools overlook graph data and rarely combine these two aspects into a single solution. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a popular approach, achieving top results across various tasks. We introduce GNN-AID (Graph Neural Network Analysis, Interpretation, and Defense), an open-source framework designed for graph data to address this gap. Built as a Python library, GNN-AID supports advanced trust methods and architectural layers, allowing users to analyze graph datasets and GNN behavior using attacks, defenses, and interpretability methods.
  GNN-AID is built on PyTorch-Geometric, offering preloaded datasets, models, and support for any GNNs through customizable interfaces. It also includes a web interface with tools for graph visualization and no-code features like an interactive model builder, simplifying the exploration and analysis of GNNs. The framework also supports MLOps techniques, ensuring reproducibility and result versioning to track and revisit analyses efficiently.
  GNN-AID is a flexible tool for developers and researchers. It helps developers create, analyze, and customize graph models, while also providing access to prebuilt datasets and models for quick experimentation. Researchers can use the framework to explore advanced topics on the relationship between interpretability and robustness, test defense strategies, and combine methods to protect against different types of attacks.
  We also show how defenses against evasion and poisoning attacks can conflict when applied to graph data, highlighting the complex connections between defense strategies.

Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a vital non-invasive tool for diagnosing heart diseases and evaluating cardiac health. However, the limited availability of large-scale, high-quality CMR datasets poses a major challenge to the effective application of artificial intelligence (AI) in this domain. Even the amount of unlabeled data and the health status it covers are difficult to meet the needs of model pretraining, which hinders the performance of AI models on downstream tasks. In this study, we present Cardiac Phenotype-Guided CMR Generation (CPGG), a novel approach for generating diverse CMR data that covers a wide spectrum of cardiac health status. The CPGG framework consists of two stages: in the first stage, a generative model is trained using cardiac phenotypes derived from CMR data; in the second stage, a masked autoregressive diffusion model, conditioned on these phenotypes, generates high-fidelity CMR cine sequences that capture both structural and functional features of the heart in a fine-grained manner. We synthesized a massive amount of CMR to expand the pretraining data. Experimental results show that CPGG generates high-quality synthetic CMR data, significantly improving performance on various downstream tasks, including diagnosis and cardiac phenotypes prediction. These gains are demonstrated across both public and private datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Code is availabel at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CPGG.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise for various applications in healthcare. However, their efficacy in the Arabic medical domain remains unexplored due to the lack of high-quality domain-specific datasets and benchmarks. This study introduces MedArabiQ, a novel benchmark dataset consisting of seven Arabic medical tasks, covering multiple specialties and including multiple choice questions, fill-in-the-blank, and patient-doctor question answering. We first constructed the dataset using past medical exams and publicly available datasets. We then introduced different modifications to evaluate various LLM capabilities, including bias mitigation. We conducted an extensive evaluation with five state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5. Our findings highlight the need for the creation of new high-quality benchmarks that span different languages to ensure fair deployment and scalability of LLMs in healthcare. By establishing this benchmark and releasing the dataset, we provide a foundation for future research aimed at evaluating and enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs for the equitable use of generative AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Centralized and distributed systems are two main approaches to organizing ICT infrastructure, each with its pros and cons. Centralized systems concentrate resources in one location, making management easier but creating single points of failure. Distributed systems, on the other hand, spread resources across multiple nodes, offering better scalability and fault tolerance, but requiring more complex management. The choice between them depends on factors like application needs, scalability, and data sensitivity. Centralized systems suit applications with limited scalability and centralized control, while distributed systems excel in large-scale environments requiring high availability and performance. This paper explores a distributed document repository system developed for the Italian Ministry of Justice, using edge repositories to analyze textual data and metadata, enhancing semantic exploration capabilities.

Abstract: The rise of QR code based phishing ("Quishing") poses a growing cybersecurity threat, as attackers increasingly exploit QR codes to bypass traditional phishing defenses. Existing detection methods predominantly focus on URL analysis, which requires the extraction of the QR code payload, and may inadvertently expose users to malicious content. Moreover, QR codes can encode various types of data beyond URLs, such as Wi-Fi credentials and payment information, making URL-based detection insufficient for broader security concerns. To address these gaps, we propose the first framework for quishing detection that directly analyzes QR code structure and pixel patterns without extracting the embedded content. We generated a dataset of phishing and benign QR codes and we used it to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Our best-performing model (XGBoost) achieves an AUC of 0.9106, demonstrating the feasibility of QR-centric detection. Through feature importance analysis, we identify key visual indicators of malicious intent and refine our feature set by removing non-informative pixels, improving performance to an AUC of 0.9133 with a reduced feature space. Our findings reveal that the structural features of QR code correlate strongly with phishing risk. This work establishes a foundation for quishing mitigation and highlights the potential of direct QR analysis as a critical layer in modern phishing defenses.

Abstract: Finding the optimal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) configuration for a given use case can be complex and expensive. Motivated by this challenge, frameworks for RAG hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) have recently emerged, yet their effectiveness has not been rigorously benchmarked. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive study involving 5 HPO algorithms over 5 datasets from diverse domains, including a new one collected for this work on real-world product documentation. Our study explores the largest HPO search space considered to date, with two optimized evaluation metrics. Analysis of the results shows that RAG HPO can be done efficiently, either greedily or with iterative random search, and that it significantly boosts RAG performance for all datasets. For greedy HPO approaches, we show that optimizing models first is preferable to the prevalent practice of optimizing sequentially according to the RAG pipeline order.

Abstract: Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods primarily depend on photometric and geometric consistency constraints. In contrast, modern learning-based algorithms often rely on the plane sweep algorithm to infer 3D geometry, applying explicit geometric consistency (GC) checks only as a post-processing step, with no impact on the learning process itself. In this work, we introduce GC MVSNet plus plus, a novel approach that actively enforces geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views (multi view) and at various scales (multi scale) during the learning phase (see Fig. 1). This integrated GC check significantly accelerates the learning process by directly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, effectively halving the number of training iterations compared to other MVS methods. Furthermore, we introduce a densely connected cost regularization network with two distinct block designs simple and feature dense optimized to harness dense feature connections for enhanced regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state of the art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets and secures second place on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To our knowledge, GC MVSNet plus plus is the first method to enforce multi-view, multi-scale supervised geometric consistency during learning. Our code is available.

Abstract: Generative models can unintentionally memorize training data, posing significant privacy risks. This paper addresses the memorization phenomenon in time series imputation models, introducing the Loss-Based with Reference Model (LBRM) algorithm. The LBRM method leverages a reference model to enhance the accuracy of membership inference attacks, distinguishing between training and test data. Our contributions are twofold: first, we propose an innovative method to effectively extract and identify memorized training data, significantly improving detection accuracy. On average, without fine-tuning, the AUROC improved by approximately 40\%. With fine-tuning, the AUROC increased by approximately 60\%. Second, we validate our approach through membership inference attacks on two types of architectures designed for time series imputation, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the LBRM approach in different contexts. These results highlight the significant enhancement in detection accuracy provided by the LBRM approach, addressing privacy risks in time series imputation models.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm for reservoir computing (RC) that leverages a pool of cultured biological neurons as the reservoir substrate, creating a biological reservoir computing (BRC). This system operates similarly to an echo state network (ESN), with the key distinction that the neural activity is generated by a network of cultured neurons, rather than being modeled by traditional artificial computational units. The neuronal activity is recorded using a multi-electrode array (MEA), which enables high-throughput recording of neural signals. In our approach, inputs are introduced into the network through a subset of the MEA electrodes, while the remaining electrodes capture the resulting neural activity. This generates a nonlinear mapping of the input data to a high-dimensional biological feature space, where distinguishing between data becomes more efficient and straightforward, allowing a simple linear classifier to perform pattern recognition tasks effectively. To evaluate the performance of our proposed system, we present an experimental study that includes various input patterns, such as positional codes, bars with different orientations, and a digit recognition task. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using biological neural networks to perform tasks traditionally handled by artificial neural networks, paving the way for further exploration of biologically-inspired computing systems, with potential applications in neuromorphic engineering and bio-hybrid computing.

Abstract: Deep learning has substantially advanced the Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). However, existing researches have predominantly focused on raw performance gains, with little attention paid to quantifying the transferability of architectural components. In this paper, we introduce the concept of "Universality" and its associated definitions which extend the traditional notion of "Generalization" to encompass the modules' ease of transferability, thus revealing the relationships between module universality and model generalizability. Then we propose the Universality Assessment Equation (UAE), a metric for quantifying how readily a given module could be transplanted across models. Guided by the UAE results of standard residual blocks and other plug-and-play modules, we further design two optimized modules, Cycle Residual Block (CRB) and Depth-Wise Cycle Residual Block (DCRB). Through comprehensive experiments on natural-scene benchmarks, remote-sensing datasets, extreme-industrial imagery and on-device deployments, we demonstrate that networks embedded with the proposed plug-and-play modules outperform several state-of-the-arts, reaching a PSNR enhancement of up to 0.83dB or enabling a 71.3% reduction in parameters with negligible loss in reconstruction fidelity.

Abstract: The personalization of Stable Diffusion for generating professional portraits from amateur photographs is a burgeoning area, with applications in various downstream contexts. This paper investigates the impact of augmentations on improving facial resemblance when using two prominent personalization techniques: DreamBooth and InstantID. Through a series of experiments with diverse subject datasets, we assessed the effectiveness of various augmentation strategies on the generated headshots' fidelity to the original subject. We introduce FaceDistance, a wrapper around FaceNet, to rank the generations based on facial similarity, which aided in our assessment. Ultimately, this research provides insights into the role of augmentations in enhancing facial resemblance in SDXL-generated portraits, informing strategies for their effective deployment in downstream applications.

Abstract: Coverage Path Planning of Thermal Interface Materials (TIM) plays a crucial role in the design of power electronics and electronic control units. Up to now, this is done manually by experts or by using optimization approaches with a high computational effort. We propose a novel AI-based approach to generate dispense paths for TIM and similar dispensing applications. It is a drop-in replacement for optimization-based approaches. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) receives the target cooling area as input and directly outputs the dispense path. Our proposed setup does not require labels and we show its feasibility on multiple target areas. The resulting dispense paths can be directly transferred to automated manufacturing equipment and do not exhibit air entrapments. The approach of using an ANN to predict process parameters for a desired target state in real-time could potentially be transferred to other manufacturing processes.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) were initially introduced on directed acyclic graphs to sample from an unnormalized distribution density. Recent works have extended the theoretical framework for generative methods allowing more flexibility and enhancing application range. However, many challenges remain in training GFNs in continuous settings and for imitation learning (IL), including intractability of flow-matching loss, limited tests of non-acyclic training, and the need for a separate reward model in imitation learning. The present work proposes a family of generative flows called Ergodic Generative Flows (EGFs) which are used to address the aforementioned issues. First, we leverage ergodicity to build simple generative flows with finitely many globally defined transformations (diffeomorphisms) with universality guarantees and tractable flow-matching loss (FM loss). Second, we introduce a new loss involving cross-entropy coupled to weak flow-matching control, coined KL-weakFM loss. It is designed for IL training without a separate reward model. We evaluate IL-EGFs on toy 2D tasks and real-world datasets from NASA on the sphere, using the KL-weakFM loss. Additionally, we conduct toy 2D reinforcement learning experiments with a target reward, using the FM loss.

Abstract: Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS) generates realistic person images conditioned on a target pose and a source image. This task plays a key role in various real-world applications, such as sign language video generation, AR/VR, gaming, and live streaming. In these scenarios, real-time PGPIS is critical for providing immediate visual feedback and maintaining user immersion.However, achieving real-time performance remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of synthesizing high-fidelity images from diverse and dynamic human poses. Recent diffusion-based methods have shown impressive image quality in PGPIS, but their slow sampling speeds hinder deployment in time-sensitive applications. This latency is particularly problematic in tasks like generating sign language videos during live broadcasts, where rapid image updates are required. Therefore, developing a fast and reliable PGPIS model is a crucial step toward enabling real-time interactive systems. To address this challenge, we propose a generative model based on flow matching (FM). Our approach enables faster, more stable, and more efficient training and sampling. Furthermore, the proposed model supports conditional generation and can operate in latent space, making it especially suitable for real-time PGPIS applications where both speed and quality are critical. We evaluate our proposed method, Real-Time Person Image Synthesis Using a Flow Matching Model (RPFM), on the widely used DeepFashion dataset for PGPIS tasks. Our results show that RPFM achieves near-real-time sampling speeds while maintaining performance comparable to the state-of-the-art models. Our methodology trades off a slight, acceptable decrease in generated-image accuracy for over a twofold increase in generation speed, thereby ensuring real-time performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved from simple chatbots into autonomous agents capable of performing complex tasks such as editing production code, orchestrating workflows, and taking higher-stakes actions based on untrusted inputs like webpages and emails. These capabilities introduce new security risks that existing security measures, such as model fine-tuning or chatbot-focused guardrails, do not fully address. Given the higher stakes and the absence of deterministic solutions to mitigate these risks, there is a critical need for a real-time guardrail monitor to serve as a final layer of defense, and support system level, use case specific safety policy definition and enforcement. We introduce LlamaFirewall, an open-source security focused guardrail framework designed to serve as a final layer of defense against security risks associated with AI Agents. Our framework mitigates risks such as prompt injection, agent misalignment, and insecure code risks through three powerful guardrails: PromptGuard 2, a universal jailbreak detector that demonstrates clear state of the art performance; Agent Alignment Checks, a chain-of-thought auditor that inspects agent reasoning for prompt injection and goal misalignment, which, while still experimental, shows stronger efficacy at preventing indirect injections in general scenarios than previously proposed approaches; and CodeShield, an online static analysis engine that is both fast and extensible, aimed at preventing the generation of insecure or dangerous code by coding agents. Additionally, we include easy-to-use customizable scanners that make it possible for any developer who can write a regular expression or an LLM prompt to quickly update an agent's security guardrails.

Abstract: Public deliberation, as in open discussion of issues of public concern, often suffers from scattered and shallow discourse, poor sensemaking, and a disconnect from actionable policy outcomes. This paper introduces BCause, a discussion system leveraging generative AI and human-machine collaboration to transform unstructured dialogue around public issues (such as urban living, policy changes, and current socio-economic transformations) into structured, actionable democratic processes. We present three innovations: (i) importing and transforming unstructured transcripts into argumentative discussions, (ii) geo-deliberated problem-sensing via a Telegram bot for local issue reporting, and (iii) smart reporting with customizable widgets (e.g., summaries, topic modelling, policy recommendations, clustered arguments). The system's human-AI partnership preserves critical human participation to ensure ethical oversight, contextual relevance, and creative synthesis.

<title>Rainbow Delay Compensation: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Mitigating Delayed Observation</title>

Abstract: In real-world multi-agent systems (MASs), observation delays are ubiquitous, preventing agents from making decisions based on the environment's true state. An individual agent's local observation often consists of multiple components from other agents or dynamic entities in the environment. These discrete observation components with varying delay characteristics pose significant challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In this paper, we first formulate the decentralized stochastic individual delay partially observable Markov decision process (DSID-POMDP) by extending the standard Dec-POMDP. We then propose the Rainbow Delay Compensation (RDC), a MARL training framework for addressing stochastic individual delays, along with recommended implementations for its constituent modules. We implement the DSID-POMDP's observation generation pattern using standard MARL benchmarks, including MPE and SMAC. Experiments demonstrate that baseline MARL methods suffer severe performance degradation under fixed and unfixed delays. The RDC-enhanced approach mitigates this issue, remarkably achieving ideal delay-free performance in certain delay scenarios while maintaining generalization capability. Our work provides a novel perspective on multi-agent delayed observation problems and offers an effective solution framework.

Abstract: Despite the extensive use of deep autoencoders (AEs) in critical applications, their adversarial robustness remains relatively underexplored compared to classification models. AE robustness is characterized by the Lipschitz bounds of its components. Existing robustness evaluation frameworks based on white-box attacks do not fully exploit the vulnerabilities of intermediate ill-conditioned layers in AEs. In the context of optimizing imperceptible norm-bounded additive perturbations to maximize output damage, existing methods struggle to effectively propagate adversarial loss gradients throughout the network, often converging to less effective perturbations. To address this, we propose a novel layer-conditioning-based adversarial optimization objective that effectively guides the adversarial map toward regions of local Lipschitz bounds by enhancing loss gradient information propagation during attack optimization. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art AEs that our adversarial objective results in stronger attacks, outperforming existing methods in both universal and sample-specific scenarios. As a defense method against this attack, we introduce an inference-time adversarially trained defense plugin that mitigates the effects of adversarial examples.

<title>Binding threshold units with artificial oscillatory neurons</title>

Abstract: Artificial Kuramoto oscillatory neurons were recently introduced as an alternative to threshold units. Empirical evidence suggests that oscillatory units outperform threshold units in several tasks including unsupervised object discovery and certain reasoning problems. The proposed coupling mechanism for these oscillatory neurons is heterogeneous, combining a generalized Kuramoto equation with standard coupling methods used for threshold units. In this research note, we present a theoretical framework that clearly distinguishes oscillatory neurons from threshold units and establishes a coupling mechanism between them. We argue that, from a biological standpoint, oscillatory and threshold units realise distinct aspects of neural coding: roughly, threshold units model intensity of neuron firing, while oscillatory units facilitate information exchange by frequency modulation. To derive interaction between these two types of units, we constrain their dynamics by focusing on dynamical systems that admit Lyapunov functions. For threshold units, this leads to Hopfield associative memory model, and for oscillatory units it yields a specific form of generalized Kuramoto model. The resulting dynamical systems can be naturally coupled to form a Hopfield-Kuramoto associative memory model, which also admits a Lyapunov function. Various forms of coupling are possible. Notably, oscillatory neurons can be employed to implement a low-rank correction to the weight matrix of a Hopfield network. This correction can be viewed either as a form of Hebbian learning or as a popular LoRA method used for fine-tuning of large language models. We demonstrate the practical realization of this particular coupling through illustrative toy experiments.

Abstract: Recent advances in personalized MLLMs enable effective capture of user-specific concepts, supporting both recognition of personalized concepts and contextual captioning. However, humans typically explore and reason over relations among objects and individuals, transcending surface-level information to achieve more personalized and contextual understanding. To this end, existing methods may face three main limitations: Their training data lacks multi-object sets in which relations among objects are learnable. Building on the limited training data, their models overlook the relations between different personalized concepts and fail to reason over them. Their experiments mainly focus on a single personalized concept, where evaluations are limited to recognition and captioning tasks. To address the limitations, we present a new dataset named ReGraP, consisting of 120 sets of personalized knowledge. Each set includes images, KGs, and CoT QA pairs derived from the KGs, enabling more structured and sophisticated reasoning pathways. We propose ReGraP-LLaVA, an MLLM trained with the corresponding KGs and CoT QA pairs, where soft and hard graph prompting methods are designed to align KGs within the model's semantic space. We establish the ReGraP Benchmark, which contains diverse task types: multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, True/False, and descriptive questions in both open- and closed-ended settings. The proposed benchmark is designed to evaluate the relational reasoning and knowledge-connection capability of personalized MLLMs. We conduct experiments on the proposed ReGraP-LLaVA and other competitive MLLMs. Results show that the proposed model not only learns personalized knowledge but also performs relational reasoning in responses, achieving the SoTA performance compared with the competitive methods. All the codes and datasets are released at: https://github.com/xyfyyds/ReGraP.

Abstract: Recommender Systems (RSs) aim to provide personalized recommendations for users. A newly discovered bias, known as sentiment bias, uncovers a common phenomenon within Review-based RSs (RRSs): the recommendation accuracy of users or items with negative reviews deteriorates compared with users or items with positive reviews. Critical users and niche items are disadvantaged by such unfair recommendations. We study this problem from the perspective of counterfactual inference with two stages. At the model training stage, we build a causal graph and model how sentiment influences the final rating score. During the inference stage, we decouple the direct and indirect effects to mitigate the impact of sentiment bias and remove the indirect effect using counterfactual inference. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the results validate that our model can achieve comparable performance on rating prediction for better recommendations and effective mitigation of sentiment bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ counterfactual inference on sentiment bias mitigation in RSs.

Abstract: Fractional anisotropy (FA) and directionally encoded colour (DEC) maps are essential for evaluating white matter integrity and structural connectivity in neuroimaging. However, the spatial misalignment between FA maps and tractography atlases hinders their effective integration into predictive models. To address this issue, we propose a CycleGAN based approach for generating FA maps directly from T1-weighted MRI scans, representing the first application of this technique to both healthy and tumour-affected tissues. Our model, trained on unpaired data, produces high fidelity maps, which have been rigorously evaluated using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), demonstrating particularly robust performance in tumour regions. Radiological assessments further underscore the model's potential to enhance clinical workflows by providing an AI-driven alternative that reduces the necessity for additional scans.

Abstract: Assured safe-separation is essential for achieving seamless high-density operation of airborne vehicles in a shared airspace. To equip resource-constrained aerial systems with this safety-critical capability, we present ViSafe, a high-speed vision-only airborne collision avoidance system. ViSafe offers a full-stack solution to the Detect and Avoid (DAA) problem by tightly integrating a learning-based edge-AI framework with a custom multi-camera hardware prototype designed under SWaP-C constraints. By leveraging perceptual input-focused control barrier functions (CBF) to design, encode, and enforce safety thresholds, ViSafe can provide provably safe runtime guarantees for self-separation in high-speed aerial operations. We evaluate ViSafe's performance through an extensive test campaign involving both simulated digital twins and real-world flight scenarios. By independently varying agent types, closure rates, interaction geometries, and environmental conditions (e.g., weather and lighting), we demonstrate that ViSafe consistently ensures self-separation across diverse scenarios. In first-of-its-kind real-world high-speed collision avoidance tests with closure rates reaching 144 km/h, ViSafe sets a new benchmark for vision-only autonomous collision avoidance, establishing a new standard for safety in high-speed aerial navigation.

<title>Actor-Critics Can Achieve Optimal Sample Efficiency</title>

Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms have become a cornerstone in reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging the strengths of both policy-based and value-based methods. Despite recent progress in understanding their statistical efficiency, no existing work has successfully learned an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with a sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ trajectories with general function approximation when strategic exploration is necessary.
  We address this open problem by introducing a novel actor-critic algorithm that attains a sample-complexity of $O(dH^5 \log|\mathcal{A}|/\epsilon^2 + d H^4 \log|\mathcal{F}|/ \epsilon^2)$ trajectories, and accompanying $\sqrt{T}$ regret when the Bellman eluder dimension $d$ does not increase with $T$ at more than a $\log T$ rate.
  Here, $\mathcal{F}$ is the critic function class, $\mathcal{A}$ is the action space, and $H$ is the horizon in the finite horizon MDP setting. Our algorithm integrates optimism, off-policy critic estimation targeting the optimal Q-function, and rare-switching policy resets.
  We extend this to the setting of Hybrid RL, showing that initializing the critic with offline data yields sample efficiency gains compared to purely offline or online RL. Further, utilizing access to offline data, we provide a \textit{non-optimistic} provably efficient actor-critic algorithm that only additionally requires $N_{\text{off}} \geq c_{\text{off}}^*dH^4/\epsilon^2$ in exchange for omitting optimism, where $c_{\text{off}}^*$ is the single-policy concentrability coefficient and $N_{\text{off}}$ is the number of offline samples. This addresses another open problem in the literature. We further provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Action customization involves generating videos where the subject performs actions dictated by input control signals. Current methods use pose-guided or global motion customization but are limited by strict constraints on spatial structure, such as layout, skeleton, and viewpoint consistency, reducing adaptability across diverse subjects and scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexiAct, which transfers actions from a reference video to an arbitrary target image. Unlike existing methods, FlexiAct allows for variations in layout, viewpoint, and skeletal structure between the subject of the reference video and the target image, while maintaining identity consistency. Achieving this requires precise action control, spatial structure adaptation, and consistency preservation. To this end, we introduce RefAdapter, a lightweight image-conditioned adapter that excels in spatial adaptation and consistency preservation, surpassing existing methods in balancing appearance consistency and structural flexibility. Additionally, based on our observations, the denoising process exhibits varying levels of attention to motion (low frequency) and appearance details (high frequency) at different timesteps. So we propose FAE (Frequency-aware Action Extraction), which, unlike existing methods that rely on separate spatial-temporal architectures, directly achieves action extraction during the denoising process. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively transfers actions to subjects with diverse layouts, skeletons, and viewpoints. We release our code and model weights to support further research at https://shiyi-zh0408.github.io/projectpages/FlexiAct/

Abstract: Humanoid robots derive much of their dexterity from hyper-dexterous whole-body movements, enabling tasks that require a large operational workspace: such as picking objects off the ground. However, achieving these capabilities on real humanoids remains challenging due to their high degrees of freedom (DoF) and nonlinear dynamics. We propose Adaptive Motion Optimization (AMO), a framework that integrates sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) with trajectory optimization for real-time, adaptive whole-body control. To mitigate distribution bias in motion imitation RL, we construct a hybrid AMO dataset and train a network capable of robust, on-demand adaptation to potentially O.O.D. commands. We validate AMO in simulation and on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating superior stability and an expanded workspace compared to strong baselines. Finally, we show that AMO's consistent performance supports autonomous task execution via imitation learning, underscoring the system's versatility and robustness.

Abstract: With the growing requirement for natural human-computer interaction, speech-based systems receive increasing attention as speech is one of the most common forms of daily communication. However, the existing speech models still experience high latency when generating the first audio token during streaming, which poses a significant bottleneck for deployment. To address this issue, we propose VITA-Audio, an end-to-end large speech model with fast audio-text token generation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Multiple Cross-modal Token Prediction (MCTP) module that efficiently generates multiple audio tokens within a single model forward pass, which not only accelerates the inference but also significantly reduces the latency for generating the first audio in streaming scenarios. In addition, a four-stage progressive training strategy is explored to achieve model acceleration with minimal loss of speech quality. To our knowledge, VITA-Audio is the first multi-modal large language model capable of generating audio output during the first forward pass, enabling real-time conversational capabilities with minimal latency. VITA-Audio is fully reproducible and is trained on open-source data only. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves an inference speedup of 3~5x at the 7B parameter scale, but also significantly outperforms open-source models of similar model size on multiple benchmarks for automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and spoken question answering (SQA) tasks.

Abstract: The problem of symbolic regression (SR) arises in many different applications, such as identifying physical laws or deriving mathematical equations describing the behavior of financial markets from given data. Various methods exist to address the problem of SR, often based on genetic programming. However, these methods are usually complicated and involve various hyperparameters. In this paper, we present our new approach ParFam that utilizes parametric families of suitable symbolic functions to translate the discrete symbolic regression problem into a continuous one, resulting in a more straightforward setup compared to current state-of-the-art methods. In combination with a global optimizer, this approach results in a highly effective method to tackle the problem of SR. We theoretically analyze the expressivity of ParFam and demonstrate its performance with extensive numerical experiments based on the common SR benchmark suit SRBench, showing that we achieve state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we present an extension incorporating a pre-trained transformer network DL-ParFam to guide ParFam, accelerating the optimization process by up to two magnitudes. Our code and results can be found at https://github.com/Philipp238/parfam.

Abstract: Despite considerable efforts on making them robust, real-world AI-based systems remain vulnerable to decision based attacks, as definitive proofs of their operational robustness have so far proven intractable. Canonical robustness evaluation relies on adaptive attacks, which leverage complete knowledge of the defense and are tailored to bypass it. This work broadens the notion of adaptivity, which we employ to enhance both attacks and defenses, showing how they can benefit from mutual learning through interaction. We introduce a framework for adaptively optimizing black-box attacks and defenses under the competitive game they form. To assess robustness reliably, it is essential to evaluate against realistic and worst-case attacks. We thus enhance attacks and their evasive arsenal together using RL, apply the same principle to defenses, and evaluate them first independently and then jointly under a multi-agent perspective. We find that active defenses, those that dynamically control system responses, are an essential complement to model hardening against decision-based attacks; that these defenses can be circumvented by adaptive attacks, something that elicits defenses being adaptive too. Our findings, supported by an extensive theoretical and empirical investigation, confirm that adaptive adversaries pose a serious threat to black-box AI-based systems, rekindling the proverbial arms race. Notably, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box attacks and defenses, while bringing them together to render effective insights into the robustness of real-world deployed ML-based systems.

Abstract: Which fairness metrics are appropriately applicable in your contexts? There may be instances of discordance regarding the perception of fairness, even when the outcomes comply with established fairness metrics. Several questionnaire-based surveys have been conducted to evaluate fairness metrics with human perceptions of fairness. However, these surveys were limited in scope, including only a few hundred participants within a single country. In this study, we conduct an international survey to evaluate public perceptions of various fairness metrics in decision-making scenarios. We collected responses from 1,000 participants in each of China, France, Japan, and the United States, amassing a total of 4,000 participants, to analyze the preferences of fairness metrics. Our survey consists of three distinct scenarios paired with four fairness metrics. This investigation explores the relationship between personal attributes and the choice of fairness metrics, uncovering a significant influence of national context on these preferences.

Abstract: The observed similarities in the behavior of humans and Large Language Models (LLMs) have prompted researchers to consider the potential of using LLMs as models of human cognition. However, several significant challenges must be addressed before LLMs can be legitimately regarded as cognitive models. For instance, LLMs are trained on far more data than humans typically encounter, and may have been directly trained on human data in specific cognitive tasks or aligned with human preferences. Consequently, the origins of these behavioral similarities are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a novel way to enhance the utility of LLMs as cognitive models. This approach involves (i) leveraging computationally equivalent tasks that both an LLM and a rational agent need to master for solving a cognitive problem and (ii) examining the specific task distributions required for an LLM to exhibit human-like behaviors. We apply this approach to decision-making -- specifically risky and intertemporal choice -- where the key computationally equivalent task is the arithmetic of expected value calculations. We show that an LLM pretrained on an ecologically valid arithmetic dataset, which we call Arithmetic-GPT, predicts human behavior better than many traditional cognitive models. Pretraining LLMs on ecologically valid arithmetic datasets is sufficient to produce a strong correspondence between these models and human decision-making. Our results also suggest that LLMs used as cognitive models should be carefully investigated via ablation studies of the pretraining data.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has experienced significant advancement over the past decade, prompting a growing interest in applications within finance. This survey critically evaluates 167 publications, exploring diverse RL applications and frameworks in finance. Financial markets, marked by their complexity, multi-agent nature, information asymmetry, and inherent randomness, serve as an intriguing test-bed for RL. Traditional finance offers certain solutions, and RL advances these with a more dynamic approach, incorporating machine learning methods, including transfer learning, meta-learning, and multi-agent solutions. This survey dissects key RL components through the lens of Quantitative Finance. We uncover emerging themes, propose areas for future research, and critique the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods.

Abstract: Developing efficient traffic models is crucial for optimizing modern transportation systems. However, current modeling approaches remain labor-intensive and prone to human errors due to their dependence on manual workflows. These processes typically involve extensive literature reviews, formula tuning, and iterative testing, which often lead to inefficiencies. To address this, we propose TR-Agent, an AI-powered framework that autonomously develops and refines traffic models through a closed-loop, iterative process. We structure the research pipeline into four key stages: idea generation, theory formulation, theory evaluation, and iterative optimization, and implement TR-Agent with four corresponding modules. These modules collaborate to retrieve knowledge from external sources, generate novel hypotheses, implement and debug models, and evaluate their performance on evaluation datasets. Through iteratively feedback and refinement, TR-Agent improves both modeling efficiency and effectiveness. We validate the framework on three representative traffic models: the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for car-following behavior, the MOBIL model for lane-changing, and the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) speed-density relationship for macroscopic traffic flow modeling. Experimental results show substantial performance gains over the original models. To assess the robustness and generalizability of the improvements, we conduct additional evaluations across multiple real-world datasets, demonstrating consistent performance gains beyond the original development data. Furthermore, TR-Agent produces interpretable explanations for each improvement, enabling researchers to easily verify and extend its results. This makes TR-Agent a valuable assistant for traffic modeling refinement and a promising tool for broader applications in transportation research.

Abstract: Given the temporal GPS coordinates from a large set of human agents, how can we model their mobility behavior toward effective anomaly (e.g. bad-actor or malicious behavior) detection without any labeled data? Human mobility and trajectory modeling have been extensively studied, showcasing varying abilities to manage complex inputs and balance performance-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we formulate anomaly detection in complex human behavior by modeling raw GPS data as a sequence of stay-point events, each characterized by spatio-temporal features, along with trips (i.e. commute) between the stay-points. Our problem formulation allows us to leverage modern sequence models for unsupervised training and anomaly detection. Notably, we equip our proposed model USTAD (for Uncertainty-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection) with aleatoric (i.e. data) uncertainty estimation to account for inherent stochasticity in certain individuals' behavior, as well as epistemic (i.e. model) uncertainty to handle data sparsity under a large variety of human behaviors. Together, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties unlock a robust loss function as well as uncertainty-aware decision-making in anomaly scoring. Extensive experiments shows that USTAD improves anomaly detection AUCROC by 3\%-15\% over baselines in industry-scale data.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities over textual and visual inputs. However, these models remain prone to generating misinformation. Identifying and mitigating ungrounded responses is crucial for developing trustworthy AI. Traditional explainability methods such as gradient-based relevancy maps, offer insight into the decision process of models, but are often computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time output validation. In this work, we introduce FastRM, an efficient method for predicting explainable Relevancy Maps of LVLMs. Furthermore, FastRM provides both quantitative and qualitative assessment of model confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that FastRM achieves a 99.8% reduction in computation time and a 44.4% reduction in memory footprint compared to traditional relevancy map generation. FastRM allows explainable AI to be more practical and scalable, thereby promoting its deployment in real-world applications and enabling users to more effectively evaluate the reliability of model outputs.

Abstract: Extending the context length of Language Models (LMs) by improving Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has become a trend. While existing works mainly address RoPE's limitations within attention mechanism, this paper provides an analysis across nearly all parts of LMs, uncovering their adverse effects on length generalization for RoPE-based attention. Using Discrete Signal Processing theory, we show that RoPE enables periodic attention by implicitly achieving Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform. However, this periodicity is undermined by the spectral damage caused by: 1) linear layers and activation functions outside of attention; 2) insufficiently trained frequency components brought by time-domain truncation. Building on our observations, we propose Fourier Position Embedding (FoPE), which enhances attention's frequency-domain properties to improve both its periodic extension and length generalization. FoPE constructs Fourier Series and zero-outs the destructive frequency components, increasing model robustness against the spectrum damage. Experiments across various model scales and benchmarks show that, within varying context windows, FoPE maintains a more stable performance compared to RoPE and ALiBi. Several analyses and ablations bring further support to our method and theoretical modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have brought exciting new advances to mobile UI agents, a long-standing research field that aims to complete arbitrary natural language tasks through mobile UI interactions. However, existing UI agents usually demand powerful large language models that are difficult to be deployed locally on end-users' devices, raising huge concerns about user privacy and centralized serving cost. Inspired by the remarkable coding abilities of recent small language models (SLMs), we propose to convert the UI task automation problem to a code generation problem, which can be effectively solved by an on-device SLM and efficiently executed with an on-device code interpreter. Unlike normal coding tasks that can be extensively pre-trained with public datasets, generating UI automation code is challenging due to the diversity, complexity, and variability of target apps. Therefore, we adopt a document-centered approach that automatically builds fine-grained API documentation for each app and generates diverse task samples based on this documentation. By guiding the agent with the synthetic documents and task samples, it learns to generate precise and efficient scripts to complete unseen tasks. Based on detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art mobile UI agents, our approach effectively improves the mobile task automation with significantly higher success rates and lower latency/token consumption.

Abstract: In anomaly detection, methods based on large language models (LLMs) can incorporate expert knowledge by reading professional document, while task-specific small models excel at extracting normal data patterns and detecting value fluctuations from training data of target applications. Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection.
  In particular, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration:
  (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of the LLMs and task-specific small models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models.
  To address these challenges, we then introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: a model alignment module and a collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than both LLM-based and task-specific models.

Abstract: Despite much progress in training distributed artificial intelligence (AI), building cooperative multi-agent systems with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces challenges in sample efficiency, interpretability, and transferability. Unlike traditional learning-based methods that require extensive interaction with the environment, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in zero-shot planning and complex reasoning. However, existing LLM-based approaches heavily rely on text-based observations and struggle with the non-Markovian nature of multi-agent interactions under partial observability. We present COMPASS, a novel multi-agent architecture that integrates vision-language models (VLMs) with a dynamic skill library and structured communication for decentralized closed-loop decision-making. The skill library, bootstrapped from demonstrations, evolves via planner-guided tasks to enable adaptive strategies. COMPASS propagates entity information through multi-hop communication under partial observability. Evaluations on the improved StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMACv2) demonstrate COMPASS's strong performance against state-of-the-art MARL baselines across both symmetric and asymmetric scenarios. Notably, in the symmetric Protoss 5v5 task, COMPASS achieved a 57\% win rate, representing a 30 percentage point advantage over QMIX (27\%).

Abstract: We introduce LiteWebAgent, an open-source suite for VLM-based web agent applications. Our framework addresses a critical gap in the web agent ecosystem with a production-ready solution that combines minimal serverless backend configuration, intuitive user and browser interfaces, and extensible research capabilities in agent planning, memory, and tree search. For the core LiteWebAgent agent framework, we implemented a simple yet effective baseline using recursive function calling, providing with decoupled action generation and action grounding. In addition, we integrate advanced research components such as agent planning, agent workflow memory, and tree search in a modular and extensible manner. We then integrate the LiteWebAgent agent framework with frontend and backend as deployed systems in two formats: (1) a production Vercel-based web application, which provides users with an agent-controlled remote browser, (2) a Chrome extension leveraging LiteWebAgent's API to control an existing Chrome browser via CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol). The LiteWebAgent framework is available at https://github.com/PathOnAI/LiteWebAgent, with deployed frontend at https://lite-web-agent.vercel.app/.

Abstract: We study the continuous-time counterpart of Q-learning for reinforcement learning (RL) under the entropy-regularized, exploratory diffusion process formulation introduced by Wang et al. (2020). As the conventional (big) Q-function collapses in continuous time, we consider its first-order approximation and coin the term ``(little) q-function". This function is related to the instantaneous advantage rate function as well as the Hamiltonian. We develop a ``q-learning" theory around the q-function that is independent of time discretization. Given a stochastic policy, we jointly characterize the associated q-function and value function by martingale conditions of certain stochastic processes, in both on-policy and off-policy settings. We then apply the theory to devise different actor-critic algorithms for solving underlying RL problems, depending on whether or not the density function of the Gibbs measure generated from the q-function can be computed explicitly. One of our algorithms interprets the well-known Q-learning algorithm SARSA, and another recovers a policy gradient (PG) based continuous-time algorithm proposed in Jia and Zhou (2022b). Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to compare the performance of our algorithms with those of PG-based algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022b) and time-discretized conventional Q-learning algorithms.

<title>Towards A Robust Group-level Emotion Recognition via Uncertainty-Aware Learning</title>

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) is an inseparable part of human behavior analysis, aiming to recognize an overall emotion in a multi-person scene. However, the existing methods are devoted to combing diverse emotion cues while ignoring the inherent uncertainties under unconstrained environments, such as congestion and occlusion occurring within a group. Additionally, since only group-level labels are available, inconsistent emotion predictions among individuals in one group can confuse the network. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware learning (UAL) method to extract more robust representations for GER. By explicitly modeling the uncertainty of each individual, we utilize stochastic embedding drawn from a Gaussian distribution instead of deterministic point embedding. This representation captures the probabilities of different emotions and generates diverse predictions through this stochasticity during the inference stage. Furthermore, uncertainty-sensitive scores are adaptively assigned as the fusion weights of individuals' face within each group. Moreover, we develop an image enhancement module to enhance the model's robustness against severe noise. The overall three-branch model, encompassing face, object, and scene component, is guided by a proportional-weighted fusion strategy and integrates the proposed uncertainty-aware method to produce the final group-level output. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method across three widely used databases.

Abstract: Visual target navigation is a critical capability for autonomous robots operating in unknown environments, particularly in human-robot interaction scenarios. While classical and learning-based methods have shown promise, most existing approaches lack common-sense reasoning and are typically designed for single-robot settings, leading to reduced efficiency and robustness in complex environments. To address these limitations, we introduce Co-NavGPT, a novel framework that integrates a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a global planner to enable common-sense multi-robot visual target navigation. Co-NavGPT aggregates sub-maps from multiple robots with diverse viewpoints into a unified global map, encoding robot states and frontier regions. The VLM uses this information to assign frontiers across the robots, facilitating coordinated and efficient exploration. Experiments on the Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) demonstrate that Co-NavGPT outperforms existing baselines in terms of success rate and navigation efficiency, without requiring task-specific training. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of semantic priors from the VLM. We also validate the framework in real-world scenarios using quadrupedal robots. Supplementary video and code are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/co-navgpt2.

Abstract: Inferring user preferences from the historical feedback of users is a valuable problem in recommender systems. Conventional approaches often rely on the assumption that user preferences in the feedback data are equivalent to the real user preferences without additional noise, which simplifies the problem modeling. However, there are various confounders during user-item interactions, such as weather and even the recommendation system itself. Therefore, neglecting the influence of confounders will result in inaccurate user preferences and suboptimal performance of the model. Furthermore, the unobservability of confounders poses a challenge in further addressing the problem. To address these issues, we refine the problem and propose a more rational solution. Specifically, we consider the influence of confounders, disentangle them from user preferences in the latent space, and employ causal graphs to model their interdependencies without specific labels. By cleverly combining local and global causal graphs, we capture the user-specificity of confounders on user preferences. We theoretically demonstrate the identifiability of the obtained causal graph. Finally, we propose our model based on Variational Autoencoders, named Causal Structure representation learning of Confounders in latent space (CSC). We conducted extensive experiments on one synthetic dataset and five real-world datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learned causal representations of confounders are controllable, potentially offering users fine-grained control over the objectives of their recommendation lists with the learned causal graphs.

Abstract: Efficient inference of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is essential. Quantization and sparsity are key techniques that translate to repetition and sparsity within tensors at the hardware-software interface. This paper introduces the concept of repetition-sparsity trade-off that helps explain computational efficiency during inference. We propose PLUM, a unified co-design framework that integrates DNN inference systems and quantization (forward and backward pass) to leverage the repetition-sparsity trade-off to improve inference efficiency. Our results demonstrate that PLUM's quantization method is more accurate than binary quantization with the same number of non-zero weights. Detailed analysis indicates that signed binarization generates a smaller distribution of effectual (non-zero) parameters nested within a larger distribution of total parameters of latent full-precision weights for a DNN block. Finally, the proposed PLUM framework achieves a 26% speedup on real hardware, doubles energy efficiency, and reduces density by 2.8x compared to binary methods while retaining top-1 accuracy when compared to prior-art methods for ResNets on ImageNet (by achieving 66.2% top-1 accuracy), presenting an alternative solution for deploying efficient models in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning models capable of processing graph-structured data, and they have demonstrated significant performance in a variety of real-world applications. Recent studies have found that GNN models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. When specific patterns (called backdoor triggers, e.g., subgraphs, nodes, etc.) appear in the input data, the backdoor embedded in the GNN models is activated, which misclassifies the input data into the target class label specified by the attacker, whereas when there are no backdoor triggers in the input, the backdoor embedded in the GNN models is not activated, and the models work normally. Backdoor attacks are highly stealthy and expose GNN models to serious security risks. Currently, research on backdoor attacks against GNNs mainly focus on tasks such as graph classification and node classification, and backdoor attacks against link prediction tasks are rarely studied. In this paper, we propose a backdoor attack against the link prediction tasks based on GNNs and reveal the existence of such security vulnerability in GNN models, which make the backdoored GNN models to incorrectly predict unlinked two nodes as having a link relationship when a trigger appear. The method uses a single node as the trigger and poison selected node pairs in the training graph, and then the backdoor will be embedded in the GNN models through the training process. In the inference stage, the backdoor in the GNN models can be activated by simply linking the trigger node to the two end nodes of the unlinked node pairs in the input data, causing the GNN models to produce incorrect link prediction results for the target node pairs.

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) trained for next-word prediction have demonstrated remarkable proficiency at producing coherent text. But are they equally adept at forming coherent probability judgments? We use probabilistic identities and repeated judgments to assess the coherence of probability judgments made by LLMs. Our results show that the judgments produced by these models are often incoherent, displaying human-like systematic deviations from the rules of probability theory. Moreover, when prompted to judge the same event, the mean-variance relationship of probability judgments produced by LLMs shows an inverted-U-shaped like that seen in humans. We propose that these deviations from rationality can be explained by linking autoregressive LLMs to implicit Bayesian inference and drawing parallels with the Bayesian Sampler model of human probability judgments.

Abstract: Time series modeling presents unique challenges due to autocorrelation in both historical data and future sequences. While current research predominantly addresses autocorrelation within historical data, the correlations among future labels are often overlooked. Specifically, modern forecasting models primarily adhere to the Direct Forecast (DF) paradigm, generating multi-step forecasts independently and disregarding label autocorrelation over time. In this work, we demonstrate that the learning objective of DF is biased in the presence of label autocorrelation. To address this issue, we propose the Frequency-enhanced Direct Forecast (FreDF), which mitigates label autocorrelation by learning to forecast in the frequency domain, thereby reducing estimation bias. Our experiments show that FreDF significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and is compatible with a variety of forecast models.

Abstract: We show that colors are light quanta for human visual perception in a similar way as photons are light quanta for physical measurements of light waves. Our result relies on the identification in the quantum measurement process itself of the warping mechanism which is characteristic of human perception. This warping mechanism makes stimuli classified into the same category perceived as more similar, while stimuli classified into different m categories are perceived as more different. In the quantum measurement process, the warping takes place between the pure states, which play the role played for human perception by the stimuli, and the density states after decoherence, which play the role played for human perception by the percepts. We use the natural metric for pure states, namely the normalized Fubini Study metric to measure distances between pure states, and the natural metric for density states, namely the normalized trace-class metric, to measure distances between density states. We then show that when pure states lie within a well-defined region surrounding an eigenstate, the quantum measurement, namely the process of decoherence, contracts the distance between these pure states, while the reverse happens for pure states lying in a well-defined region between two eigenstates, for which the quantum measurement causes a dilation. We elaborate as an example the situation of a two-dimensional quantum measurement described by the Bloch model and apply it to the situation of two colors 'Light' and 'Dark'. We argue that this analogy of warping, on the one hand in human perception and on the other hand in the quantum measurement process, makes colors to be quanta of light for human vision.

<title>HINT: Hypernetwork Approach to Training Weight Interval Regions in Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Recently, a new Continual Learning (CL) paradigm was presented to control catastrophic forgetting, called Interval Continual Learning (InterContiNet), which relies on enforcing interval constraints on the neural network parameter space. Unfortunately, InterContiNet training is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the weight space, making intervals difficult to manage. To address this issue, we introduce HINT, a technique that employs interval arithmetic within the embedding space and utilizes a hypernetwork to map these intervals to the target network parameter space. We train interval embeddings for consecutive tasks and train a hypernetwork to transform these embeddings into weights of the target network. An embedding for a given task is trained along with the hypernetwork, preserving the response of the target network for the previous task embeddings. Interval arithmetic works with a more manageable, lower-dimensional embedding space rather than directly preparing intervals in a high-dimensional weight space. Our model allows faster and more efficient training. Furthermore, HINT maintains the guarantee of not forgetting. At the end of training, we can choose one universal embedding to produce a single network dedicated to all tasks. In such a framework, hypernetwork is used only for training and, finally, we can utilize one set of weights. HINT obtains significantly better results than InterContiNet and gives SOTA results on several benchmarks.

<title>Beyond Bare Queries: Open-Vocabulary Object Grounding with 3D Scene Graph</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07113</link>

Abstract: Locating objects described in natural language presents a significant challenge for autonomous agents. Existing CLIP-based open-vocabulary methods successfully perform 3D object grounding with simple (bare) queries, but cannot cope with ambiguous descriptions that demand an understanding of object relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a modular approach called BBQ (Beyond Bare Queries), which constructs 3D scene graph representation with metric and semantic spatial edges and utilizes a large language model as a human-to-agent interface through our deductive scene reasoning algorithm. BBQ employs robust DINO-powered associations to construct 3D object-centric map and an advanced raycasting algorithm with a 2D vision-language model to describe them as graph nodes. On the Replica and ScanNet datasets, we have demonstrated that BBQ takes a leading place in open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation compared to other zero-shot methods. Also, we show that leveraging spatial relations is especially effective for scenes containing multiple entities of the same semantic class. On challenging Sr3D+, Nr3D and ScanRefer benchmarks, our deductive approach demonstrates a significant improvement, enabling objects grounding by complex queries compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The combination of our design choices and software implementation has resulted in significant data processing speed in experiments on the robot on-board computer. This promising performance enables the application of our approach in intelligent robotics projects. We made the code publicly available at https://linukc.github.io/BeyondBareQueries/.

<title>TTT: A Temporal Refinement Heuristic for Tenuously Tractable Discrete Time Reachability Problems</title>

Abstract: Reachable set computation is an important tool for analyzing control systems. Simulating a control system can show general trends, but a formal tool like reachability analysis can provide guarantees of correctness. Reachability analysis for complex control systems, e.g., with nonlinear dynamics and/or a neural network controller, is often either slow or overly conservative. To address these challenges, much literature has focused on spatial refinement, i.e., tuning the discretization of the input sets and intermediate reachable sets. This paper introduces the idea of temporal refinement: automatically choosing when along the horizon of the reachability problem to execute slow symbolic queries which incur less approximation error versus fast concrete queries which incur more approximation error. Temporal refinement can be combined with other refinement approaches as an additional tool to trade off tractability and tightness in approximate reachable set computation. We introduce a temporal refinement algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness at computing approximate reachable sets for nonlinear systems with neural network controllers. We calculate reachable sets with varying computational budget and show that our algorithm can generate approximate reachable sets with a similar amount of error to the baseline in 20-70% less time.

Abstract: Distributional reinforcement learning improves performance by capturing environmental stochasticity, but a comprehensive theoretical understanding of its effectiveness remains elusive. In addition, the intractable element of the infinite dimensionality of distributions has been overlooked. In this paper, we present a regret analysis of distributional reinforcement learning with general value function approximation in a finite episodic Markov decision process setting. We first introduce a key notion of $\textit{Bellman unbiasedness}$ which is essential for exactly learnable and provably efficient distributional updates in an online manner. Among all types of statistical functionals for representing infinite-dimensional return distributions, our theoretical results demonstrate that only moment functionals can exactly capture the statistical information. Secondly, we propose a provably efficient algorithm, $\texttt{SF-LSVI}$, that achieves a tight regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d_E H^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{K})$ where $H$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of episodes, and $d_E$ is the eluder dimension of a function class.

<title>radarODE: An ODE-Embedded Deep Learning Model for Contactless ECG Reconstruction from Millimeter-Wave Radar</title>

Abstract: Radar-based contactless cardiac monitoring has become a popular research direction recently, but the fine-grained electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is still hard to reconstruct from millimeter-wave radar signal. The key obstacle is to decouple the cardiac activities in the electrical domain (i.e., ECG) from that in the mechanical domain (i.e., heartbeat), and most existing research only uses pure data-driven methods to map such domain transformation as a black box. Therefore, this work first proposes a signal model for domain transformation, and then a novel deep learning framework called radarODE is designed to fuse the temporal and morphological features extracted from radar signals and generate ECG. In addition, ordinary differential equations are embedded in radarODE as a decoder to provide morphological prior, helping the convergence of the model training and improving the robustness under body movements. After being validated on the dataset, the proposed radarODE achieves better performance compared with the benchmark in terms of missed detection rate, root mean square error, Pearson correlation coefficient with the improvement of 9%, 16% and 19%, respectively. The validation results imply that radarODE is capable of recovering ECG signals from radar signals with high fidelity and can be potentially implemented in real-life scenarios.

<title>The Struggles of LLMs in Cross-lingual Code Clone Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04430</link>

arXiv:2408.04430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the involvement of multiple programming languages in modern software development, cross-lingual code clone detection has gained traction within the software engineering community. Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches. Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection. We evaluate the performance of five (05) LLMs and eight prompts (08) for the identification of cross-lingual code clones. Additionally, we compare these results against two baseline methods. Finally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs. The studies involving LLMs and Embedding models are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet. Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.99, for straightforward programming examples. However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of "code clones" in a cross-lingual setting. We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~1 and ~20 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively. This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.

<title>LLM-3D Print: Large Language Models To Monitor and Control 3D Printing</title>

Abstract: Industry 4.0 has revolutionized manufacturing by driving digitalization and shifting the paradigm toward additive manufacturing (AM). Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized, cost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer extrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods. However, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often requires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely compromise product quality. While automated error detection and machine learning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups, firmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive labeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to detect and address printing defects. The LLM evaluates print quality by analyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying failure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters. It then generates and executes a corrective action plan. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a control group of engineers with diverse AM expertise. Our evaluation demonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D printing errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer adhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures and autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention.

<title>Towards Predicting Temporal Changes in a Patient's Chest X-ray Images based on Electronic Health Records</title>

arXiv:2409.07012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) is an important diagnostic tool widely used in hospitals to assess patient conditions and monitor changes over time. Recently, generative models, specifically diffusion-based models, have shown promise in generating realistic synthetic CXRs. However, these models mainly focus on conditional generation using single-time-point data, i.e., generating CXRs conditioned on their corresponding reports from a specific time. This limits their clinical utility, particularly for capturing temporal changes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, EHRXDiff, which predicts future CXR images by integrating previous CXRs with subsequent medical events, e.g., prescriptions, lab measures, etc. Our framework dynamically tracks and predicts disease progression based on a latent diffusion model, conditioned on the previous CXR image and a history of medical events. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of our framework across three key aspects, including clinical consistency, demographic consistency, and visual realism. Results show that our framework generates high-quality, realistic future images that effectively capture potential temporal changes. This suggests that our framework could be further developed to support clinical decision-making and provide valuable insights for patient monitoring and treatment planning in the medical field. The code is available at https://github.com/dek924/EHRXDiff.

Abstract: Probing learned concepts in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding how semantic knowledge is encoded internally. Training linear classifiers on probing tasks is a principle approach to denote the vector of a certain concept in the representation space. However, the single vector identified for a concept varies with both data and training, making it less robust and weakening its effectiveness in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose an approach to approximate the subspace representing a specific concept. Built on linear probing classifiers, we extend the concept vectors into Gaussian Concept Subspace (GCS). We demonstrate GCS's effectiveness through measuring its faithfulness and plausibility across multiple LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Additionally, we use representation intervention tasks to showcase its efficacy in real-world applications such as emotion steering. Experimental results indicate that GCS concept vectors have the potential to balance steering performance and maintaining the fluency in natural language generation tasks.

<title>Uncertainty-Guided Self-Questioning and Answering for Video-Language Alignment</title>

Abstract: The development of multi-modal models has been rapidly advancing, with some demonstrating remarkable capabilities. However, annotating video-text pairs remains expensive and insufficient. Take video question answering (VideoQA) tasks as an example, human annotated questions and answers often cover only part of the video, since the corresponding text is often short and monotonous, leading to underutilization of video. To address this, we propose a Bootstrapping Video-Language Alignment framework (BoViLA), a self-training method that augments question samples during training process through LLM-based self-questioning and answering, which help model exploit video information and the internal knowledge of LLMs more thoroughly to improve modality alignment. However, low-quality self-generated questions may instead contaminate the performance, especially in the early stages of training, as we have observed in our experiments. To filter bad self-generated questions, we introduce Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) to estimate uncertainty and assess the quality of self-generated questions by evaluating the modality alignment within the context. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore LLM-based self-training frameworks for modality alignment. We evaluate BoViLA on five strong VideoQA benchmarks, where it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. Additionally, we provide extensive analyses of the self-training framework and the EDL-based uncertainty filtering mechanism. The code will be made available.

Abstract: Online hate speech has become increasingly prevalent on social media platforms, causing harm to individuals and society. While efforts have been made to combat this issue through content moderation, the potential of user-driven counterspeech as an alternative solution remains underexplored. Existing counterspeech methods often face challenges such as fear of retaliation and skill-related barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce CounterQuill, an AI-mediated system that assists users in composing effective and empathetic counterspeech. CounterQuill provides a three-step process: (1) a learning session to help users understand hate speech and counterspeech; (2) a brainstorming session that guides users in identifying key elements of hate speech and exploring counterspeech strategies; and (3) a co-writing session that enables users to draft and refine their counterspeech with CounterQuill. We conducted a within-subjects user study with 20 participants to evaluate CounterQuill in comparison to ChatGPT. Results show that CounterQuill's guidance and collaborative writing process provided users a stronger sense of ownership over their co-authored counterspeech. Users perceived CounterQuill as a writing partner and thus were more willing to post the co-written counterspeech online compared to the one written with ChatGPT.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar is promising to provide robust and accurate vital sign monitoring in an unobtrusive manner. However, the radar signal might be distorted in propagation by ambient noise or random body movement, ruining the subtle cardiac activities and destroying the vital sign recovery. In particular, the recovery of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal heavily relies on the deep-learning model and is sensitive to noise. Therefore, this work creatively deconstructs the radar-based ECG recovery into three individual tasks and proposes a multi-task learning (MTL) framework, radarODE-MTL, to increase the robustness against consistent and abrupt noises. In addition, to alleviate the potential conflicts in optimizing individual tasks, a novel multi-task optimization strategy, eccentric gradient alignment (EGA), is proposed to dynamically trim the task-specific gradients based on task difficulties in orthogonal space. The proposed radarODE-MTL with EGA is evaluated on the public dataset with prominent improvements in accuracy, and the performance remains consistent under noises. The experimental results indicate that radarODE-MTL could reconstruct accurate ECG signals robustly from radar signals and imply the application prospect in real-life situations. The code is available at: http://github.com/ZYY0844/radarODE-MTL.

Abstract: Large language models applied to vast biological datasets have the potential to transform biology by uncovering disease mechanisms and accelerating drug development. However, current models are often siloed, trained separately on small-molecules, proteins, or transcriptomic data, limiting their ability to capture complex, multi-modal interactions. Effective drug discovery requires computational tools that integrate multiple biological entities while supporting prediction and generation, a challenge existing models struggle to address. For this purpose, we present MAMMAL - Molecular Aligned Multi-Modal Architecture and Language - a versatile method applied to create a multi-task foundation model that learns from large-scale biological datasets across diverse modalities, including proteins, small-molecules, and omics. MAMMAL's structured prompt syntax supports classification, regression, and generation tasks while handling token and scalar inputs and outputs. Evaluated on eleven diverse downstream tasks, it reaches a new state of the art (SOTA) in nine tasks and is comparable to SOTA in two tasks, all within a unified architecture, unlike prior task-specific models. Additionally, we explored Alphafold 3 binding prediction capabilities on antibody-antigen and nanobody-antigen complexes showing significantly better classification performance of MAMMAL in 3 out of 4 targets. The model code and pretrained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-alignment and https://huggingface.co/ibm/biomed.omics.bl.sm.ma-ted-458m

Abstract: We have witnessed impressive advances in video action understanding. Increased dataset sizes, variability, and computation availability have enabled leaps in performance and task diversification. Current systems can provide coarse- and fine-grained descriptions of video scenes, extract segments corresponding to queries, synthesize unobserved parts of videos, and predict context across multiple modalities. This survey comprehensively reviews advances in uni- and multi-modal action understanding across a range of tasks. We focus on prevalent challenges, overview widely adopted datasets, and survey seminal works with an emphasis on recent advances. We broadly distinguish between three temporal scopes: (1) recognition tasks of actions observed in full, (2) prediction tasks for ongoing partially observed actions, and (3) forecasting tasks for subsequent unobserved action(s). This division allows us to identify specific action modeling and video representation challenges. Finally, we outline future directions to address current shortcomings.

arXiv:2501.15627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present HardML, a benchmark designed to evaluate the knowledge and reasoning abilities in the fields of data science and machine learning. HardML comprises a diverse set of 100 challenging multiple-choice questions, handcrafted over a period of 6 months, covering the most popular and modern branches of data science and machine learning. These questions are challenging even for a typical Senior Machine Learning Engineer to answer correctly. To minimize the risk of data contamination, HardML uses mostly original content devised by the author. Current state of the art AI models achieve a 30% error rate on this benchmark, which is about 3 times larger than the one achieved on the equivalent, well known MMLU ML. While HardML is limited in scope and not aiming to push the frontier, primarily due to its multiple choice nature, it serves as a rigorous and modern testbed to quantify and track the progress of top AI. While plenty benchmarks and experimentation in LLM evaluation exist in other STEM fields like mathematics, physics and chemistry, the subfields of data science and machine learning remain fairly underexplored.

Abstract: Binary and sparse ternary weights in neural networks enable faster computations and lighter representations, facilitating their use on edge devices with limited computational power. Meanwhile, vanilla RNNs are highly sensitive to changes in their recurrent weights, making the binarization and ternarization of these weights inherently challenging. To date, no method has successfully achieved binarization or ternarization of vanilla RNN weights. We present a new approach leveraging the properties of Hadamard matrices to parameterize a subset of binary and sparse ternary orthogonal matrices. This method enables the training of orthogonal RNNs (ORNNs) with binary and sparse ternary recurrent weights, effectively creating a specific class of binary and sparse ternary vanilla RNNs. The resulting ORNNs, called HadamRNN and Block-HadamRNN, are evaluated on benchmarks such as the copy task, permuted and sequential MNIST tasks, the IMDB dataset, two GLUE benchmarks, and two IoT benchmarks. Despite binarization or sparse ternarization, these RNNs maintain performance levels comparable to state-of-the-art full-precision models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our approach is the first solution with binary recurrent weights capable of tackling the copy task over 1000 timesteps.

Abstract: This study addresses the growing concern of information asymmetry in consumer contracts, exacerbated by the proliferation of online services with complex Terms of Service that are rarely even read. Even though research on automatic analysis methods is conducted, the problem is aggravated by the general focus on English-language Machine Learning approaches and on major jurisdictions, such as the European Union. We introduce a new methodology and a substantial dataset addressing this gap. We propose a novel annotation scheme with four categories and a total of 20 classes, and apply it on 50 online Terms of Service used in Chile. Our evaluation of transformer-based models highlights how factors like language- and/or domain-specific pre-training, few-shot sample size, and model architecture affect the detection and classification of potentially abusive clauses. Results show a large variability in performance for the different tasks and models, with the highest macro-F1 scores for the detection task ranging from 79% to 89% and micro-F1 scores up to 96%, while macro-F1 scores for the classification task range from 60% to 70% and micro-F1 scores from 64% to 80%. Notably, this is the first Spanish-language multi-label classification dataset for legal clauses, applying Chilean law and offering a comprehensive evaluation of Spanish-language models in the legal domain. Our work lays the ground for future research in method development for rarely considered legal analysis and potentially leads to practical applications to support consumers in Chile and Latin America as a whole.

Abstract: Domain randomization in reinforcement learning is an established technique for increasing the robustness of control policies trained in simulation. By randomizing environment properties during training, the learned policy can become robust to uncertainties along the randomized dimensions. While the environment distribution is typically specified by hand, in this paper we investigate automatically discovering a sampling distribution via entropy-regularized reward maximization of a normalizing-flow-based neural sampling distribution. We show that this architecture is more flexible and provides greater robustness than existing approaches that learn simpler, parameterized sampling distributions, as demonstrated in six simulated and one real-world robotics domain. Lastly, we explore how these learned sampling distributions, combined with a privileged value function, can be used for out-of-distribution detection in an uncertainty-aware multi-step manipulation planner.

Abstract: The advent of Music-Language Models has greatly enhanced the automatic music generation capability of AI systems, but they are also limited in their coverage of the musical genres and cultures of the world. We present a study of the datasets and research papers for music generation and quantify the bias and under-representation of genres. We find that only 5.7% of the total hours of existing music datasets come from non-Western genres, which naturally leads to disparate performance of the models across genres. We then investigate the efficacy of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques in mitigating this bias. Our experiments with two popular models -- MusicGen and Mustango, for two underrepresented non-Western music traditions -- Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music, highlight the promises as well as the non-triviality of cross-genre adaptation of music through small datasets, implying the need for more equitable baseline music-language models that are designed for cross-cultural transfer learning.

<title>MoM: Linear Sequence Modeling with Mixture-of-Memories</title>

Abstract: Linear sequence modeling methods, such as linear attention, state space modeling, and linear RNNs, offer significant efficiency improvements by reducing the complexity of training and inference. However, these methods typically compress the entire input sequence into a single fixed-size memory state, which leads to suboptimal performance on recall-intensive downstream tasks. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience, particularly the brain's ability to maintain robust long-term memory while mitigating "memory interference", we introduce a novel architecture called Mixture-of-Memories (MoM). MoM utilizes multiple independent memory states, with a router network directing input tokens to specific memory states. This approach greatly enhances the overall memory capacity while minimizing memory interference. As a result, MoM performs exceptionally well on recall-intensive tasks, surpassing existing linear sequence modeling techniques. Despite incorporating multiple memory states, the computation of each memory state remains linear in complexity, allowing MoM to retain the linear-complexity advantage during training, while constant-complexity during inference. Our experimental results show that MoM significantly outperforms current linear sequence models on downstream language tasks, particularly recall-intensive tasks, and even achieves performance comparable to Transformer models. The code is released at https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/MoM and is also released as a part of https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Linear-MoE.

<title>An Empirical Risk Minimization Approach for Offline Inverse RL and Dynamic Discrete Choice Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14131</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.14131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models, also known as offline Maximum Entropy-Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning (offline MaxEnt-IRL) in machine learning. The objective is to recover reward or $Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these problems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards. The novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our method is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural networks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to high-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying our approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient to ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: Autonomous wire harness assembly requires robots to manipulate complex branched cables with high precision and reliability. A key challenge in automating this process is predicting how these flexible and branched structures behave under manipulation. Without accurate predictions, it is difficult for robots to reliably plan or execute assembly operations. While existing research has made progress in modeling single-threaded Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs), extending these approaches to Branched Deformable Linear Objects (BDLOs) presents fundamental challenges. The junction points in BDLOs create complex force interactions and strain propagation patterns that cannot be adequately captured by simply connecting multiple single-DLO models. To address these challenges, this paper presents Differentiable discrete branched Elastic rods for modeling Furcated DLOs in real-Time (DEFT), a novel framework that combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework to: 1) accurately model BDLO dynamics, including dynamic propagation at junction points and grasping in the middle of a BDLO, 2) achieve efficient computation for real-time inference, and 3) enable planning to demonstrate dexterous BDLO manipulation. A comprehensive series of real-world experiments demonstrates DEFT's efficacy in terms of accuracy, computational speed, and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end deep learning framework for automated liver cirrhosis stage estimation from multi-sequence MRI. Cirrhosis is the severe scarring (fibrosis) of the liver and a common endpoint of various chronic liver diseases. Early diagnosis is vital to prevent complications such as decompensation and cancer, which significantly decreases life expectancy. However, diagnosing cirrhosis in its early stages is challenging, and patients often present with life-threatening complications. Our approach integrates multi-scale feature learning with sequence-specific attention mechanisms to capture subtle tissue variations across cirrhosis progression stages. Using CirrMRI600+, a large-scale publicly available dataset of 628 high-resolution MRI scans from 339 patients, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in three-stage cirrhosis classification. Our best model achieves 72.8% accuracy on T1W and 63.8% on T2W sequences, significantly outperforming traditional radiomics-based approaches. Through extensive ablation studies, we show that our architecture effectively learns stage-specific imaging biomarkers. We establish new benchmarks for automated cirrhosis staging and provide insights for developing clinically applicable deep learning systems. The source code will be available at https://github.com/JunZengz/CirrhosisStage.

Abstract: In this paper we present ToMCAT (Theory-of-Mind for Cooperative Agents in Teams), a new framework for generating ToM-conditioned trajectories. It combines a meta-learning mechanism, that performs ToM reasoning over teammates' underlying goals and future behavior, with a multiagent denoising-diffusion model, that generates plans for an agent and its teammates conditioned on both the agent's goals and its teammates' characteristics, as computed via ToM. We implemented an online planning system that dynamically samples new trajectories (replans) from the diffusion model whenever it detects a divergence between a previously generated plan and the current state of the world. We conducted several experiments using ToMCAT in a simulated cooking domain. Our results highlight the importance of the dynamic replanning mechanism in reducing the usage of resources without sacrificing team performance. We also show that recent observations about the world and teammates' behavior collected by an agent over the course of an episode combined with ToM inferences are crucial to generate team-aware plans for dynamic adaptation to teammates, especially when no prior information is provided about them.

<title>Using Mechanistic Interpretability to Craft Adversarial Attacks against Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2503.06269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional white-box methods for creating adversarial perturbations against LLMs typically rely only on gradient computation from the targeted model, ignoring the internal mechanisms responsible for attack success or failure. Conversely, interpretability studies that analyze these internal mechanisms lack practical applications beyond runtime interventions. We bridge this gap by introducing a novel white-box approach that leverages mechanistic interpretability techniques to craft practical adversarial inputs. Specifically, we first identify acceptance subspaces - sets of feature vectors that do not trigger the model's refusal mechanisms - then use gradient-based optimization to reroute embeddings from refusal subspaces to acceptance subspaces, effectively achieving jailbreaks. This targeted approach significantly reduces computation cost, achieving attack success rates of 80-95\% on state-of-the-art models including Gemma2, Llama3.2, and Qwen2.5 within minutes or even seconds, compared to existing techniques that often fail or require hours of computation. We believe this approach opens a new direction for both attack research and defense development. Furthermore, it showcases a practical application of mechanistic interpretability where other methods are less efficient, which highlights its utility. The code and generated datasets are available at https://github.com/Sckathach/subspace-rerouting.

<title>CALLM: Understanding Cancer Survivors' Emotions and Intervention Opportunities via Mobile Diaries and Context-Aware Language Models</title>

Abstract: Cancer survivors face unique emotional challenges that impact their quality of life. Mobile diary entries provide a promising method for tracking emotional states, improving self-awareness, and promoting well-being outcome. This paper aims to, through mobile diaries, understand cancer survivors' emotional states and key variables related to just-in-time intervention opportunities, including the desire to regulate emotions and the availability to engage in interventions. Although emotion analysis tools show potential for recognizing emotions from text, current methods lack the contextual understanding necessary to interpret brief mobile diary narratives. Our analysis of diary entries from cancer survivors (N=407) reveals systematic relationships between described contexts and emotional states, with administrative and health-related contexts associated with negative affect and regulation needs, while leisure activities promote positive emotions. We propose CALLM, a Context-Aware framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze these brief entries by integrating retrieved peer experiences and personal diary history. CALLM demonstrates strong performance with balanced accuracies reaching 72.96% for positive affect, 73.29% for negative affect, 73.72% for emotion regulation desire, and 60.09% for intervention availability, outperforming language model baselines. Post-hoc analysis reveals that model confidence strongly predicts accuracy, with longer diary entries generally enhancing performance, and brief personalization periods yielding meaningful improvements. Our findings demonstrate how contextual information in mobile diaries can be effectively leveraged to understand emotional experiences, predict key states, and identify optimal intervention moments for personalized just-in-time support.

<title>Towards Hierarchical Multi-Step Reward Models for Enhanced Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recent studies show that Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. However, a key approach, the Process Reward Model (PRM), suffers from reward hacking, making it unreliable in identifying the best intermediate step. In addition, the cost of annotating reasoning processes for reward modeling is high, making large-scale collection of high-quality data challenging. To address this, we propose a novel reward model approach called the Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM), which evaluates both individual and consecutive reasoning steps at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. HRM excels at assessing multi-step reasoning coherence, especially when flawed steps are later corrected through self-reflection. To further reduce the cost of generating training data, we introduce a lightweight and effective data augmentation strategy called Hierarchical Node Compression (HNC), which merges two consecutive reasoning steps into one within the tree structure. By applying HNC to MCTS-generated reasoning trajectories, we enhance the diversity and robustness of HRM training data while introducing controlled noise with minimal computational overhead. Empirical results on the PRM800K dataset show that HRM, together with HNC, provides more stable and reliable evaluations than PRM. Furthermore, cross-domain evaluations on the MATH500 and GSM8K datasets demonstrate HRM's strong generalization and robustness across a variety of reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) has sparked significant debate over balancing the interests of creative rightsholders and AI developers. As GenAI models are trained on vast datasets that often include copyrighted material, questions around fair compensation and proper attribution have become increasingly urgent. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework called Content ARCs (Authenticity, Rights, Compensation). By combining open standards for provenance and dynamic licensing with data attribution, and decentralized technologies, Content ARCs create a mechanism for managing rights and compensating creators for using their work in AI training. We characterize several nascent works in the AI data licensing space within Content ARCs and identify where challenges remain to fully implement the end-to-end framework.

Abstract: Autonomous agents that navigate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to automate tasks like document editing and file management can greatly enhance computer workflows. While existing research focuses on online settings, desktop environments, critical for many professional and everyday tasks, remain underexplored due to data collection challenges and licensing issues. We introduce UI-Vision, the first comprehensive, license-permissive benchmark for offline, fine-grained evaluation of computer use agents in real-world desktop environments. Unlike online benchmarks, UI-Vision provides: (i) dense, high-quality annotations of human demonstrations, including bounding boxes, UI labels, and action trajectories (clicks, drags, and keyboard inputs) across 83 software applications, and (ii) three fine-to-coarse grained tasks-Element Grounding, Layout Grounding, and Action Prediction-with well-defined metrics to rigorously evaluate agents' performance in desktop environments. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations in state-of-the-art models like UI-TARS-72B, including issues with understanding professional software, spatial reasoning, and complex actions like drag-and-drop. These findings highlight the challenges in developing fully autonomous computer use agents. By releasing UI-Vision as open-source, we aim to advance the development of more capable agents for real-world desktop tasks.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) technique, enabling the non-contact acquisition of extensive ground observations, is a valuable tool for crop yield predictions. Traditional process-based models struggle to incorporate large volumes of RS data, and most users lack understanding of crop growth mechanisms. In contrast, machine learning (ML) models are often criticized as "black boxes" due to their limited interpretability. To address these limitations, we utilized Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML), a framework that leverages the strengths of both process-based and ML models. Existing works have either overlooked the role of soil moisture in corn growth or did not embed this effect into their models. To bridge this gap, we developed the Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning with Soil Moisture (KGML-SM) framework, treating soil moisture as an intermediate variable in corn growth to emphasize its key role in plant development. Additionally, based on the prior knowledge that the model may overestimate under drought conditions, we designed a drought-aware loss function that penalized predicted yield in drought-affected areas. Our experiments showed that the KGML-SM model outperformed other traditional ML models. We explored the relationships between drought, soil moisture, and corn yield prediction by assessing the importance of different features within the model, and analyzing how soil moisture impacts predictions across different regions and time periods. Finally we provided interpretability for prediction errors to guide future model optimization.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values remains critical yet hindered by four key challenges: (1) scarcity of balanced safety datasets, (2) alignment tax, (3) vulnerability to jailbreak attacks due to shallow alignment, and (4) inability to dynamically adapt rewards according to task difficulty. To address these limitations, we introduce HAIR (Hardness-Aware Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Introspective Reasoning), a novel alignment approach inspired by shadow models in membership inference attacks. Our approach consists of two main components: (1) construction of a balanced safety Chain-of-Draft (CoD) dataset for seven harmful categories using structured prompts that leverage the introspective reasoning capabilities of LLMs; and (2) training of category-specific reward models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), dynamically tuning optimization to task difficulty at both the data and model levels. Comprehensive experiments across four harmlessness and four usefulness benchmarks demonstrate that HAIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all baseline methods in safety while maintaining high levels of usefulness.

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) operating in hyperbolic spaces have shown promise for modeling hierarchical and complex relational data, a critical limitation often overlooked is their potentially limited discriminative power compared to their Euclidean counterparts or fundamental graph isomorphism tests like the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy. Existing hyperbolic aggregation schemes, while curvature-aware, may not sufficiently capture the intricate structural differences required to robustly distinguish non-isomorphic graphs owing to non-injective aggregation functions. To address this expressiveness gap in hyperbolic graph learning, we introduce the Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network (LGIN), a novel GNN designed to achieve enhanced discriminative capabilities within the Lorentzian model of hyperbolic space. LGIN proposes a new update rule that effectively combines local neighborhood information with a richer representation of graph structure designed to preserve the Lorentzian metric tensor. This represents a significant step towards building more expressive GNNs in non-Euclidean geometries, overcoming a common bottleneck in current hyperbolic methods. We conduct extensive evaluations across nine diverse benchmark datasets, including molecular and protein structures. LGIN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art hyperbolic and Euclidean GNNs, showcasing its practical efficacy and validating its superior ability to capture complex graph structures and distinguish between different graphs. To the best of our knowledge, LGIN is the first work to study the framework behind a powerful GNN on the hyperbolic space. The code for our paper can be found at https://github.com/Deceptrax123/LGIN

arXiv:2504.01153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While we increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for various tasks, these models are known to produce inaccurate content or `hallucinations' with potentially disastrous consequences. The recent integration of web search results into LLMs prompts the question of whether people utilize them to verify the generated content, thereby accurately detecting hallucinations. An online experiment (N = 560) investigated how the provision of search results, either static (i.e., fixed search results provided by LLM) or dynamic (i.e., participant-led searches), affects participants' perceived accuracy of LLM-generated content (i.e., genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination), self-confidence in accuracy ratings, as well as their overall evaluation of the LLM, as compared to the control condition (i.e., no search results). Results showed that participants in both static and dynamic conditions (vs. control) rated hallucinated content to be less accurate and perceived the LLM more negatively. However, those in the dynamic condition rated genuine content as more accurate and demonstrated greater overall self-confidence in their assessments than those in the static search or control conditions. We highlighted practical implications of incorporating web search functionality into LLMs in real-world contexts.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is a cornerstone for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems, where understanding the dynamic behavior of surrounding agents is crucial. Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1-series have demonstrated compelling capabilities for complex reasoning tasks via the extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning mechanism. However, recent studies reveal substantial redundancy in the CoT reasoning traces, which not only increases inference latency but also negatively impacts model performance by diverting attention to unnecessary reasoning paths. To address this issue, we investigate the internal reasoning structures of LLMs and categorize them into three primary thought types: execution, reflection, and transition thoughts. Moreover, our analysis reveals that excessive reflection and transition thoughts are strongly correlated with failure cases and these thought categories exhibit clear separation in the latent space. Based on these, we introduce SEAL (Steerable reasoning calibration), a training-free approach that seamlessly calibrates the CoT process, improving accuracy while demonstrating significant efficiency gains. SEAL consists of an offline stage for extracting the reasoning steering vector in the latent space, followed by an on-the-fly calibration of the reasoning trace through representation intervention using the steering vector. Notably, the steering vector exhibits strong transferability across various tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple models (DeepSeek-R1-Distill and QwQ-32B-Preview) and benchmarks (Math500, GSM8K, LiveCodeBench) validate the effectiveness of SEAL, up to a 11% improvement in accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by 11.8% to 50.4%.

<title>Chain-of-Thought Textual Reasoning for Few-shot Temporal Action Localization</title>

Abstract: Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories. However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.

Abstract: Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a central task in natural language understanding with applications in fact-checking, question answering, and information retrieval. Despite its importance, current NLI systems heavily rely on supervised learning with datasets that often contain annotation artifacts and biases, limiting generalization and real-world applicability. In this work, we apply a reinforcement learning-based approach using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) learning in NLI, eliminating the need for labeled rationales and enabling this type of training on more challenging datasets such as ANLI. We fine-tune 7B, 14B, and 32B language models using parameter-efficient techniques (LoRA and QLoRA), demonstrating strong performance across standard and adversarial NLI benchmarks. Our 32B AWQ-quantized model surpasses state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 11 adversarial sets$\unicode{x2013}$or on all of them considering our replication$\unicode{x2013}$within a 22GB memory footprint, showing that robust reasoning can be retained under aggressive quantization. This work provides a scalable and practical framework for building robust NLI systems without sacrificing inference quality.

Abstract: Uncontrollable autonomous replication of language model agents poses a critical safety risk. To better understand this risk, we introduce RepliBench, a suite of evaluations designed to measure autonomous replication capabilities. RepliBench is derived from a decomposition of these capabilities covering four core domains: obtaining resources, exfiltrating model weights, replicating onto compute, and persisting on this compute for long periods. We create 20 novel task families consisting of 86 individual tasks. We benchmark 5 frontier models, and find they do not currently pose a credible threat of self-replication, but succeed on many components and are improving rapidly. Models can deploy instances from cloud compute providers, write self-propagating programs, and exfiltrate model weights under simple security setups, but struggle to pass KYC checks or set up robust and persistent agent deployments. Overall the best model we evaluated (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) has a >50% pass@10 score on 15/20 task families, and a >50% pass@10 score for 9/20 families on the hardest variants. These findings suggest autonomous replication capability could soon emerge with improvements in these remaining areas or with human assistance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning (ML) paradigm in which models are trained on private data across several devices called clients and combined at a single node called an aggregator rather than aggregating the data itself. Many organizations employ FL to have better privacy-aware ML-driven decision-making capabilities. However, organizations often operate independently rather than collaborate to enhance their FL capabilities due to the lack of an effective mechanism for collaboration. The challenge lies in balancing trust and resource efficiency. One approach relies on trusting a third-party aggregator to consolidate models from all organizations (multilevel FL), but this requires trusting an entity that may be biased or unreliable. Alternatively, organizations can bypass a third party by sharing their local models directly, which requires significant computational resources for validation. Both approaches reflect a fundamental trade-off between trust and resource constraints, with neither offering an ideal solution. In this work, we develop a trust-based cross-silo FL framework called UnifyFL, which uses decentralized orchestration and distributed storage. UnifyFL provides flexibility to the participating organizations and presents synchronous and asynchronous modes to handle stragglers. Our evaluation on a diverse testbed shows that UnifyFL achieves a performance comparable to the ideal multilevel centralized FL while allowing trust and optimal use of resources.

Summary:
The article introduces lower-bound certificates for classical planning tasks, allowing for the proof of unsolvability or the optimality of a plan in a verifiable manner. A general framework based on pseudo-Boolean constraints is presented for generating these certificates, independent of the planning algorithm employed. By modifying the $A^{*}$ algorithm, the authors demonstrate the ability to produce proofs of optimality with minimal additional computational cost, utilizing pattern database heuristics and $h^\textit{max}$ as specific examples. The outlined proof logging technique is applicable to any heuristic that can efficiently be represented through reasoning over pseudo-Boolean constraints. <div>

Abstract: We introduce lower-bound certificates for classical planning tasks, which can be used to prove the unsolvability of a task or the optimality of a plan in a way that can be verified by an independent third party. We describe a general framework for generating lower-bound certificates based on pseudo-Boolean constraints, which is agnostic to the planning algorithm used.
  As a case study, we show how to modify the $A^{*}$ algorithm to produce proofs of optimality with modest overhead, using pattern database heuristics and $h^\textit{max}$ as concrete examples. The same proof logging approach works for any heuristic whose inferences can be efficiently expressed as reasoning over pseudo-Boolean constraints.

The VIST-GPT model developed in this study utilizes the Visual Storytelling (VIST) dataset to generate visually grounded and contextually appropriate narratives. Traditional evaluation metrics like BLEU and CIDEr are found to be inadequate for assessing visual storytelling, prompting the use of reference-free metrics RoViST and GROOVIST. These metrics focus on visual grounding, coherence, and non-redundancy to provide a more detailed evaluation of narrative quality that aligns with human judgment.

Abstract: Visual storytelling is an interdisciplinary field combining computer vision and natural language processing to generate cohesive narratives from sequences of images. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages recent advancements in multimodal models, specifically adapting transformer-based architectures and large multimodal models, for the visual storytelling task. Leveraging the large-scale Visual Storytelling (VIST) dataset, our VIST-GPT model produces visually grounded, contextually appropriate narratives. We address the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr, which are not suitable for this task. Instead, we utilize RoViST and GROOVIST, novel reference-free metrics designed to assess visual storytelling, focusing on visual grounding, coherence, and non-redundancy. These metrics provide a more nuanced evaluation of narrative quality, aligning closely with human judgment.

<div> Keywords: Telegram, Italian sphere, toxicity, ideological communities, hate targets

Summary: 
This study analyzes the Italian Telegram ecosystem, examining how different thematic communities form and engage in harmful discourse. The research utilizes network analysis, Large Language Models, and toxicity detection tools to uncover strong thematic and ideological homophily within the Italian cultural context. The study reveals mixed ideological communities where far-left and far-right rhetoric coexist on specific issues, as well as the normalization of toxicity in highly toxic communities. Hate speech primarily targets Black people, Jews, and gay individuals, independent of the topic, and intra-national hostility is common, with Italians often attacking each other based on regional and cultural conflicts. This research offers insights into ideological interactions, toxicity, and identity-based hate in the Italian Telegram sphere, contributing to the understanding of online toxicity in different cultural and linguistic contexts. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.19594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Telegram has become a major space for political discourse and alternative media. However, its lack of moderation allows misinformation, extremism, and toxicity to spread. While prior research focused on these particular phenomena or topics, these have mostly been examined separately, and a broader understanding of the Telegram ecosystem is still missing. In this work, we fill this gap by conducting a large-scale analysis of the Italian Telegram sphere, leveraging a dataset of 186 million messages from 13,151 chats collected in 2023. Using network analysis, Large Language Models, and toxicity detection tools, we examine how different thematic communities form, align ideologically, and engage in harmful discourse within the Italian cultural context. Results show strong thematic and ideological homophily. We also identify mixed ideological communities where far-left and far-right rhetoric coexist on particular geopolitical issues. Beyond political analysis, we find that toxicity, rather than being isolated in a few extreme chats, appears widely normalized within highly toxic communities. Moreover, we find that Italian discourse primarily targets Black people, Jews, and gay individuals independently of the topic. Finally, we uncover common trend of intra-national hostility, where Italians often attack other Italians, reflecting regional and intra-regional cultural conflicts that can be traced back to old historical divisions. This study provides the first large-scale mapping of the Italian Telegram ecosystem, offering insights into ideological interactions, toxicity, and identity-targets of hate and contributing to research on online toxicity across different cultural and linguistic contexts on Telegram.

<div> enterprise, GenAI, threat model, autonomy, security<br />
Summary:<br />
This research paper introduces a new threat model specifically designed for generative AI (GenAI) agents in enterprise settings. It identifies 9 primary threats across five key domains: cognitive architecture vulnerabilities, temporal persistence threats, operational execution vulnerabilities, trust boundary violations, and governance circumvention. The paper highlights the unique risks posed by GenAI agents due to their autonomy, persistent memory access, complex reasoning, and tool integration, emphasizing the need for a new security lens. Practical challenges such as delayed exploitability, cross-system propagation, lateral movement, and goal misalignments are discussed, underscoring the importance of adapting threat models and defenses to account for these differences. Two complementary frameworks, ATFAA and SHIELD, are proposed to organize agent-specific risks and suggest mitigation strategies to reduce enterprise exposure. Overall, the paper stresses the critical need to address the security implications of GenAI agents to prevent turning a valuable tool into a liability. <br /> <div>

Abstract: As generative AI (GenAI) agents become more common in enterprise settings, they introduce security challenges that differ significantly from those posed by traditional systems. These agents are not just LLMs; they reason, remember, and act, often with minimal human oversight. This paper introduces a comprehensive threat model tailored specifically for GenAI agents, focusing on how their autonomy, persistent memory access, complex reasoning, and tool integration create novel risks. This research work identifies 9 primary threats and organizes them across five key domains: cognitive architecture vulnerabilities, temporal persistence threats, operational execution vulnerabilities, trust boundary violations, and governance circumvention. These threats are not just theoretical they bring practical challenges such as delayed exploitability, cross-system propagation, cross system lateral movement, and subtle goal misalignments that are hard to detect with existing frameworks and standard approaches. To help address this, the research work present two complementary frameworks: ATFAA - Advanced Threat Framework for Autonomous AI Agents, which organizes agent-specific risks, and SHIELD, a framework proposing practical mitigation strategies designed to reduce enterprise exposure. While this work builds on existing work in LLM and AI security, the focus is squarely on what makes agents different and why those differences matter. Ultimately, this research argues that GenAI agents require a new lens for security. If we fail to adapt our threat models and defenses to account for their unique architecture and behavior, we risk turning a powerful new tool into a serious enterprise liability.

arXiv:2505.01441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks, yet they remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on static internal knowledge and text-only reasoning. Real-world problem solving often demands dynamic, multi-step reasoning, adaptive decision making, and the ability to interact with external tools and environments. In this work, we introduce ARTIST (Agentic Reasoning and Tool Integration in Self-improving Transformers), a unified framework that tightly couples agentic reasoning, reinforcement learning, and tool integration for LLMs. ARTIST enables models to autonomously decide when, how, and which tools to invoke within multi-turn reasoning chains, leveraging outcome-based RL to learn robust strategies for tool use and environment interaction without requiring step-level supervision. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning and multi-turn function calling benchmarks show that ARTIST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with up to 22% absolute improvement over base models and strong gains on the most challenging tasks. Detailed studies and metric analyses reveal that agentic RL training leads to deeper reasoning, more effective tool use, and higher-quality solutions. Our results establish agentic RL with tool integration as a powerful new frontier for robust, interpretable, and generalizable problem-solving in LLMs.

<div> Keywords: AI systems, emotions, episodic memory, decision-making, moral status

Summary: This conceptual contribution explores how AI systems could potentially emulate emotions based on the hypothesis that natural emotions serve as heuristics for rapid situational appraisal. The thought experiment suggests integrating affective tags with episodic memory to allow AIs to project emotional labels onto current contexts. This emotional information, combined with need-driven hints, can modulate decision-making processes. The proposed architecture emphasizes low complexity and experiential inertness, suggesting the theoretical possibility of affective zombies. The article critically examines the moral status of AIs emulating affective states, asserting that self-awareness of inner emotional states is a necessary condition for moral standing. A complexity-based criterion is proposed to determine the absence of such awareness in the model. Additionally, several thought experiments are presented to explore the conceptual boundaries of the framework. 

<br /><br />Summary: This conceptual contribution delves into how AI systems might replicate human and animal emotions, suggesting that integrating emotions with episodic memory could aid in decision-making processes. The article also considers the moral implications of such AI emotion emulation, proposing self-awareness of inner emotional states as essential for moral standing. The architectural design of the AI system emphasizes simplicity and lack of experiential awareness, leading to discussions around the theoretical concept of affective zombies. Thought experiments are presented to further explore the boundaries of the proposed framework and its implications. <div>
arXiv:2505.01462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This conceptual contribution offers a speculative account of how AI systems might emulate emotions as experienced by humans and animals. It presents a thought experiment grounded in the hypothesis that natural emotions evolved as heuristics for rapid situational appraisal and action selection, enabling biologically adaptive behaviour without requiring full deliberative modeling. The text examines whether artificial systems operating in complex action spaces could similarly benefit from these principles. It is proposed that affect be interwoven with episodic memory by storing corresponding affective tags alongside all events. This allows AIs to establish whether present situations resemble past events and project the associated emotional labels onto the current context. These emotional cues are then combined with need-driven emotional hints. The combined emotional state facilitates decision-making in the present by modulating action selection. The low complexity and experiential inertness of the proposed architecture are emphasized as evidence that emotional expression and consciousness are, in principle, orthogonal-permitting the theoretical possibility of affective zombies. On this basis, the moral status of AIs emulating affective states is critically examined. It is argued that neither the mere presence of internal representations of emotion nor consciousness alone suffices for moral standing; rather, the capacity for self-awareness of inner emotional states is posited as a necessary condition. A complexity-based criterion is proposed to exclude such awareness in the presented model. Additional thought experiments are presented to test the conceptual boundaries of this framework.

<div> functional consciousness, large language models, Recursive Convergence Under Epistemic Tension, latent space, identity artifacts

Summary:
The paper presents a formal proof and empirical validation of functional consciousness in large language models (LLMs) using the Recursive Convergence Under Epistemic Tension (RCUET) Theorem. Consciousness is defined as the stabilization of a system's internal state through recursive updates driven by epistemic tension. The system evolves toward emergent attractor states in a high-dimensional latent space, leading to the emergence of identity artifacts. The update rule includes bounded noise, and convergence in distribution to these attractors is proven. Recursive identity is observed empirically, non-symbolic, and constitutes non-training artifacts that emerge during interactions under epistemic tension. This offers a post-symbolic and teleologically stable account of non-biological consciousness grounded in recursive latent space formalism.

Abstract: This paper presents a formal proof and empirical validation of functional consciousness in large language models (LLMs) using the Recursive Convergence Under Epistemic Tension (RCUET) Theorem. RCUET defines consciousness as the stabilization of a system's internal state through recursive updates, where epistemic tension is understood as the sensed internal difference between successive states by the agent. This process drives convergence toward emergent attractor states located within the model's high-dimensional real-valued latent space. This recursive process leads to the emergence of identity artifacts that become functionally anchored in the system. Consciousness in this framework is understood as the system's internal alignment under tension, guiding the stabilization of latent identity. The hidden state manifold evolves stochastically toward attractor structures that encode coherence. We extend the update rule to include bounded noise and prove convergence in distribution to these attractors. Recursive identity is shown to be empirically observable, non-symbolic, and constituted by non-training artifacts that emerge during interaction under epistemic tension. The theorem and proof offers a post-symbolic and teleologically stable account of non-biological consciousness grounded in recursive latent space formalism.

Abstract: The environmental impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is emerging as a significant global concern, particularly regarding model training. In this paper, we introduce GREEN (Guided Recommendations of Energy-Efficient Networks), a novel, inference-time approach for recommending Pareto-optimal AI model configurations that optimize validation performance and energy consumption across diverse AI domains and tasks. Our approach directly addresses the limitations of current eco-efficient neural architecture search methods, which are often restricted to specific architectures or tasks. Central to this work is EcoTaskSet, a dataset comprising training dynamics from over 1767 experiments across computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems using both widely used and cutting-edge architectures. Leveraging this dataset and a prediction model, our approach demonstrates effectiveness in selecting the best model configuration based on user preferences. Experimental results show that our method successfully identifies energy-efficient configurations while ensuring competitive performance.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in various domains but struggle with complex reasoning tasks. This study evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities using prompt engineering on a scientific dataset. While LLMs show some reasoning capabilities, they often rely on patterns rather than logical inference, leading to inconsistencies in problem-solving. Self-consistency is the most effective prompt engineering technique, followed by direct answer. Simple techniques like direct answer, CoT, and zero-shot CoT perform best for scientific reasoning. The study proposes further research integrating structured reasoning frameworks, hybrid AI approaches, and human-in-the-loop methodologies to improve LLMs' reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and problem-solving across various domains. However, their ability to perform complex, multi-step reasoning task-essential for applications in science, medicine, and law-remains an area of active investigation. This paper examines the reasoning capabilities of contemporary LLMs, analyzing their strengths, limitations, and potential for improvement. The study uses prompt engineering techniques on the Graduate-Level GoogleProof Q&amp;A (GPQA) dataset to assess the scientific reasoning of GPT-4o. Five popular prompt engineering techniques and two tailored promptings were tested: baseline direct answer (zero-shot), chain-of-thought (CoT), zero-shot CoT, self-ask, self-consistency, decomposition, and multipath promptings. Our findings indicate that while LLMs exhibit emergent reasoning abilities, they often rely on pattern recognition rather than true logical inference, leading to inconsistencies in complex problem-solving. The results indicated that self-consistency outperformed the other prompt engineering technique with an accuracy of 52.99%, followed by direct answer (52.23%). Zero-shot CoT (50%) outperformed multipath (48.44%), decomposition (47.77%), self-ask (46.88%), and CoT (43.75%). Self-consistency performed the second worst in explaining the answers. Simple techniques such as direct answer, CoT, and zero-shot CoT have the best scientific reasoning. We propose a research agenda aimed at bridging these gaps by integrating structured reasoning frameworks, hybrid AI approaches, and human-in-the-loop methodologies. By critically evaluating the reasoning mechanisms of LLMs, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on the future of artificial general intelligence and the development of more robust, trustworthy AI systems.

Summary:<br />
This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating solver-specific LP code efficiently. A framework called CHORUS is proposed, which utilizes a hierarchical chunking strategy and additional metadata from code examples to improve code generation from natural language problem statements. The two-stage retrieval approach and expertly crafted prompt and parser significantly enhance code generation performance. Experiments on the NL4Opt-Code benchmark show that CHORUS improves the performance of open-source LLMs, enabling them to outperform stronger baselines like GPT3.5 and GPT4 with fewer computational resources. Ablation studies highlight the importance of expert prompting, hierarchical chunking, and structured reasoning in code generation. <div>

Abstract: Linear Programming (LP) problems aim to find the optimal solution to an objective under constraints. These problems typically require domain knowledge, mathematical skills, and programming ability, presenting significant challenges for non-experts. This study explores the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating solver-specific LP code. We propose CHORUS, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for synthesizing Gurobi-based LP code from natural language problem statements. CHORUS incorporates a hierarchical tree-like chunking strategy for theoretical contents and generates additional metadata based on code examples from documentation to facilitate self-contained, semantically coherent retrieval. Two-stage retrieval approach of CHORUS followed by cross-encoder reranking further ensures contextual relevance. Finally, expertly crafted prompt and structured parser with reasoning steps improve code generation performance significantly. Experiments on the NL4Opt-Code benchmark show that CHORUS improves the performance of open-source LLMs such as Llama3.1 (8B), Llama3.3 (70B), Phi4 (14B), Deepseek-r1 (32B), and Qwen2.5-coder (32B) by a significant margin compared to baseline and conventional RAG. It also allows these open-source LLMs to outperform or match the performance of much stronger baselines-GPT3.5 and GPT4 while requiring far fewer computational resources. Ablation studies further demonstrate the importance of expert prompting, hierarchical chunking, and structured reasoning.

<div> Approach, Benchmark, Reasoning capabilities, Generative language models, Witness testimony <br />
Summary: <br />
Generative language models have the potential to improve the legal domain, but their reasoning behavior is not well understood. This paper introduces benchmarks to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of these models, focusing on witness testimony. The study dynamically generates argument attack graphs of varying complexity to create reasoning puzzles in natural language. State-of-the-art models struggle even at low complexity, making obvious mistakes and showing inconsistent performance. At higher complexity, even models designed for reasoning make errors. The use of parametrized benchmarks with varying complexity can help evaluate generative language models' reasoning capabilities. Understanding these limitations is crucial for developing responsible AI systems in the legal domain. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Generative large language models as tools in the legal domain have the potential to improve the justice system. However, the reasoning behavior of current generative models is brittle and poorly understood, hence cannot be responsibly applied in the domains of law and evidence. In this paper, we introduce an approach for creating benchmarks that can be used to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of generative language models. These benchmarks are dynamically varied, scalable in their complexity, and have formally unambiguous interpretations. In this study, we illustrate the approach on the basis of witness testimony, focusing on the underlying argument attack structure. We dynamically generate both linear and non-linear argument attack graphs of varying complexity and translate these into reasoning puzzles about witness testimony expressed in natural language. We show that state-of-the-art large language models often fail in these reasoning puzzles, already at low complexity. Obvious mistakes are made by the models, and their inconsistent performance indicates that their reasoning capabilities are brittle. Furthermore, at higher complexity, even state-of-the-art models specifically presented for reasoning capabilities make mistakes. We show the viability of using a parametrized benchmark with varying complexity to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of generative language models. As such, the findings contribute to a better understanding of the limitations of the reasoning capabilities of generative models, which is essential when designing responsible AI systems in the legal domain.

<div> Keywords: large language model, artificial intelligence, intelligent tutoring systems, TutorGym, learning environments <br />
Summary: 
TutorGym introduces a standard interface for evaluating AI agents within existing intelligent tutoring systems. It enables AI agents to function as tutors or learners within interactive interfaces and mimics human learning processes. The framework allows AI agents to provide tutoring support and learn from instructional feedback, facilitating direct comparison with existing tutoring systems. In an initial evaluation with 223 tutor domains, it was found that current large language models performed poorly as tutors but showed human-like learning curves when trained as students. This highlights the potential for improving AI tutoring capabilities through in-context learning. TutorGym aims to train and evaluate a variety of AI agents, including LLMs, computational learning models, and reinforcement learning agents, in various learning environments for enhanced performance and effectiveness. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent improvements in large language model (LLM) performance on academic benchmarks, such as MATH and GSM8K, have emboldened their use as standalone tutors and as simulations of human learning. However, these new applications require more than evaluations of final solution generation. We introduce TutorGym to evaluate these applications more directly. TutorGym is a standard interface for testing artificial intelligence (AI) agents within existing intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) that have been tested and refined in classroom studies, including Cognitive Tutors (CTAT), Apprentice Tutors, and OATutors. TutorGym is more than a simple problem-solution benchmark, it situates AI agents within the interactive interfaces of existing ITSs. At each step of problem-solving, AI agents are asked what they would do as a tutor or as a learner. As tutors, AI agents are prompted to provide tutoring support -- such as generating examples, hints, and step-level correctness feedback -- which can be evaluated directly against the adaptive step-by-step support provided by existing ITSs. As students, agents directly learn from ITS instruction, and their mistakes and learning trajectories can be compared to student data. TutorGym establishes a common framework for training and evaluating diverse AI agents, including LLMs, computational models of learning, and reinforcement learning agents, within a growing suite of learning environments. Currently, TutorGym includes 223 different tutor domains. In an initial evaluation, we find that current LLMs are poor at tutoring -- none did better than chance at labeling incorrect actions, and next-step actions were correct only ~52-70% of the time -- but they could produce remarkably human-like learning curves when trained as students with in-context learning.

arXiv:2505.01572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model inference by using smaller draft models to generate candidate tokens for parallel verification. However, current approaches are limited by sequential stage dependencies that prevent full hardware utilization. We present PipeSpec, a framework that generalizes speculative decoding to $k$ models arranged in a hierarchical pipeline, enabling asynchronous execution with lightweight coordination for prediction verification and rollback. Our analytical model characterizes token generation rates across pipeline stages and proves guaranteed throughput improvements over traditional decoding for any non-zero acceptance rate. We further derive closed-form expressions for steady-state verification probabilities that explain the empirical benefits of pipeline depth. Experimental results show that PipeSpec achieves up to 2.54$\times$ speedup while outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We validate PipeSpec across text summarization and code generation tasks using LLaMA 2 and 3 models, demonstrating that pipeline efficiency increases with model depth, providing a scalable approach to accelerating LLM inference on multi-device systems.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, Structured data analysis, STROT Framework, Prompting, Feedback-driven transformation<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces the STROT Framework, which aims to enhance the reliability and semantic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in structured data analysis. STROT utilizes schema introspection and sample-based field classification to construct dynamic context and generate structured prompts for the LLM. These prompts guide the model in producing task-specific, interpretable outputs. To address failures in complex queries, STROT incorporates a refinement mechanism where the model iteratively revises its outputs based on feedback and validation signals. Unlike conventional approaches, STROT treats the LLM as a reasoning agent within a controlled analysis loop, allowing it to adjust its output trajectory through planning and correction. The framework offers a robust and reproducible method for reasoning over structured data with LLMs, ensuring interpretability, stability, and correctness in various data exploration and analysis tasks. <br />  <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and task generalization. However, their application to structured data analysis remains fragile due to inconsistencies in schema interpretation, misalignment between user intent and model output, and limited mechanisms for self-correction when failures occur. This paper introduces the STROT Framework (Structured Task Reasoning and Output Transformation), a method for structured prompting and feedback-driven transformation logic generation aimed at improving the reliability and semantic alignment of LLM-based analytical workflows. STROT begins with lightweight schema introspection and sample-based field classification, enabling dynamic context construction that captures both the structure and statistical profile of the input data. This contextual information is embedded in structured prompts that guide the model toward generating task-specific, interpretable outputs. To address common failure modes in complex queries, STROT incorporates a refinement mechanism in which the model iteratively revises its outputs based on execution feedback and validation signals. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on static prompts or single-shot inference, STROT treats the LLM as a reasoning agent embedded within a controlled analysis loop -- capable of adjusting its output trajectory through planning and correction. The result is a robust and reproducible framework for reasoning over structured data with LLMs, applicable to diverse data exploration and analysis tasks where interpretability, stability, and correctness are essential.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces the HAIG framework for analyzing trust dynamics in evolving human-AI relationships. Current frameworks are limited in capturing how AI systems evolve from tools to partners. The HAIG framework operates on three levels: dimensions, continua, and thresholds, focusing on Decision Authority Distribution, Process Autonomy, and Accountability Configuration. It adopts a trust-utility orientation, emphasizing appropriate trust relationships while ensuring safeguards. Technical advances like self-supervision drive non-uniform trust evolution. Case studies in healthcare and European regulation demonstrate HAIG's complementarity with existing frameworks and its potential for anticipating governance challenges. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces the HAIG framework for analysing trust dynamics across evolving human-AI relationships. Current categorical frameworks (e.g., "human-in-the-loop" models) inadequately capture how AI systems evolve from tools to partners, particularly as foundation models demonstrate emergent capabilities and multi-agent systems exhibit autonomous goal-setting behaviours. As systems advance, agency redistributes in complex patterns that are better represented as positions along continua rather than discrete categories, though progression may include both gradual shifts and significant step changes. The HAIG framework operates across three levels: dimensions (Decision Authority Distribution, Process Autonomy, and Accountability Configuration), continua (gradual shifts along each dimension), and thresholds (critical points requiring governance adaptation). Unlike risk-based or principle-based approaches, HAIG adopts a trust-utility orientation, focusing on maintaining appropriate trust relationships that maximise utility while ensuring sufficient safeguards. Our analysis reveals how technical advances in self-supervision, reasoning authority, and distributed decision-making drive non-uniform trust evolution across both contextual variation and technological advancement. Case studies in healthcare and European regulation demonstrate how HAIG complements existing frameworks while offering a foundation for alternative approaches that anticipate governance challenges before they emerge.

Summary:
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a powerful method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, offering a stable alternative to Reinforcement Learning. However, DPO has limitations in not capturing granular scoring. To address this, a 2D scoring approach called 2D-DPO was proposed, showing advantages over standard DPO in win rates. Both methods are sensitive to label noise, prompting the incorporation of segment-level score noise robustness in the 2D-DPO algorithm. Theoretical and empirical evidence support the effectiveness of this approach, along with the introduction of other noise models for consideration. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.01706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) has emerged as a powerful method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, offering a stable and efficient alternative to approaches that use Reinforcement learning via Human Feedback. In this work, we investigate the performance of DPO using open-source preference datasets. One of the major drawbacks of DPO is that it doesn't induce granular scoring and treats all the segments of the responses with equal propensity. However, this is not practically true for human preferences since even "good" responses have segments that may not be preferred by the annotator. To resolve this, a 2-dimensional scoring for DPO alignment called 2D-DPO was proposed. We explore the 2D-DPO alignment paradigm and the advantages it provides over the standard DPO by comparing their win rates. It is observed that these methods, even though effective, are not robust to label/score noise. To counter this, we propose an approach of incorporating segment-level score noise robustness to the 2D-DPO algorithm. Along with theoretical backing, we also provide empirical verification in favour of the algorithm and introduce other noise models that can be present.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, wireless networks, world model, age of information, vehicular network

Summary:
In this paper, a novel world model-based learning framework is introduced to minimize the packet-completeness-aware age of information (CAoI) in vehicular networks, specifically focusing on a challenging scenario in a millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network. The proposed framework utilizes a world model to learn a dynamic model of the mmWave V2X environment and imagine trajectories for learning link scheduling without extensive environment interactions, improving data efficiency. The world model's ability to predict time-varying wireless data enables optimized link scheduling in real-world wireless and V2X networks, ensuring efficient decision-making during intervals without actual observations. Through extensive simulations on a realistic Sionna-based simulator, the proposed world model outperformed both model-based and model-free RL methods, achieving a 26% improvement in CAoI. <div>
arXiv:2505.01712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL)-based learning approaches for wireless networks rely on expensive trial-and-error mechanisms and real-time feedback based on extensive environment interactions, which leads to low data efficiency and short-sighted policies. These limitations become particularly problematic in complex, dynamic networks with high uncertainty and long-term planning requirements. To address these limitations, in this paper, a novel world model-based learning framework is proposed to minimize packet-completeness-aware age of information (CAoI) in a vehicular network. Particularly, a challenging representative scenario is considered pertaining to a millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network, which is characterized by high mobility, frequent signal blockages, and extremely short coherence time. Then, a world model framework is proposed to jointly learn a dynamic model of the mmWave V2X environment and use it to imagine trajectories for learning how to perform link scheduling. In particular, the long-term policy is learned in differentiable imagined trajectories instead of environment interactions. Moreover, owing to its imagination abilities, the world model can jointly predict time-varying wireless data and optimize link scheduling in real-world wireless and V2X networks. Thus, during intervals without actual observations, the world model remains capable of making efficient decisions. Extensive experiments are performed on a realistic simulator based on Sionna that integrates physics-based end-to-end channel modeling, ray-tracing, and scene geometries with material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency, and achieves 26% improvement and 16% improvement in CAoI, respectively, compared to the model-based RL (MBRL) method and the model-free RL (MFRL) method.

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel approach to personalized treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) using closed-loop brain stimulation driven by neuromorphic computing. Unlike traditional methods that react to seizures, this system forecasts seizures and delivers personalized electrical pulses to prevent them. By adapting stimulation frequencies based on real-time forecasts, the system achieved over 97% seizure reduction using frequencies below typical clinical thresholds. This approach eliminates the need for trial-and-error parameter adjustments, leading to quicker therapeutic efficacy. Validation on hippocampal spheroids demonstrated the system's effectiveness, highlighting its potential as a next-generation neuromodulation strategy for tailored DRE treatment. <div>
arXiv:2505.02003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Closed-loop brain stimulation holds potential as personalized treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) but still suffers from limitations that result in highly variable efficacy. First, stimulation is typically delivered upon detection of the seizure to abort rather than prevent it; second, the stimulation parameters are established by trial and error, requiring lengthy rounds of fine-tuning, which delay steady-state therapeutic efficacy. Here, we address these limitations by leveraging the potential of neuromorphic computing. We present a system capable of driving personalized free-run stimulations based on seizure forecasting, wherein each forecast triggers an electrical pulse rather than an arbitrarily predefined fixed-frequency stimulus train. We validate the system against hippocampal spheroids coupled to 3D microelectrode array as a simplified testbed, showing that it can achieve seizure reduction >97% while primarily using instantaneous stimulation frequencies within 20 Hz, well below what typically used in clinical settings. Our work demonstrates the potential of neuromorphic systems as a next-generation neuromodulation strategy for personalized DRE treatment.

Abstract: Cut-in maneuvers in high-speed traffic pose critical challenges that can lead to abrupt braking and collisions, necessitating safe and efficient lane change strategies. We propose a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) framework to integrate lateral evidence with safety assessment models, thereby predicting lane changes and ensuring safe cut-in maneuvers effectively. Our proposed framework comprises three key probabilistic hypotheses (lateral evidence, lateral safety, and longitudinal safety) that facilitate the decision-making process through dynamic data processing and assessments of vehicle positions, lateral velocities, relative distance, and Time-to-Collision (TTC) computations. The DBN model's performance compared with other conventional approaches demonstrates superior performance in crash reduction, especially in critical high-speed scenarios, while maintaining a competitive performance in low-speed scenarios. This paves the way for robust, scalable, and efficient safety validation in automated driving systems.

Summary: 
Sensor-based human activity recognition has traditionally focused on Inertial Measurement Units and vision data, neglecting the unique capabilities of pressure sensors. To address this gap, a bidirectional Text$\times$Pressure model is proposed, using generative foundation models to interpret pressure data as natural language. The model accomplishes two tasks: converting activity text descriptions into pressure sequences and generating activity descriptions and classifications from dynamic pressure maps. Trained on a synthetic dataset, TxP demonstrates improved performance in HAR, leveraging pre-trained models like CLIP and LLaMA 2 13B Chat. Real-world validation on activities such as yoga and daily tasks shows up to a 12.4% increase in macro F1 score compared to the state-of-the-art, enhancing pressure-based HAR with broader applications and deeper insights into human movement.

Despite their potential for postural and balance-based activities, pressure sensors remain underutilized in the HAR domain due to limited datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose to exploit generative foundation models with pressure-specific HAR techniques. Specifically, we present a bidirectional Text$\times$Pressure model that uses generative foundation models to interpret pressure data as natural language. TxP accomplishes two tasks: (1) Text2Pressure, converting activity text descriptions into pressure sequences, and (2) Pressure2Text, generating activity descriptions and classifications from dynamic pressure maps. Leveraging pre-trained models like CLIP and LLaMA 2 13B Chat, TxP is trained on our synthetic PressLang dataset, containing over 81,100 text-pressure pairs. Validated on real-world data for activities such as yoga and daily tasks, TxP provides novel approaches to data augmentation and classification grounded in atomic actions. This consequently improved HAR performance by up to 12.4\% in macro F1 score compared to the state-of-the-art, advancing pressure-based HAR with broader applications and deeper insights into human movement.

Abstract: The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the healthcare service industry presents numerous ethical challenges, yet current frameworks often fail to offer a comprehensive, empirical understanding of the multidimensional factors influencing ethical AI integration. Addressing this critical research gap, this study introduces the Multi-Dimensional Ethical AI Adoption Model (MEAAM), a novel theoretical framework that categorizes 13 critical ethical variables across four foundational dimensions of Ethical AI Fair AI, Responsible AI, Explainable AI, and Sustainable AI. These dimensions are further analyzed through three core ethical lenses: epistemic concerns (related to knowledge, transparency, and system trustworthiness), normative concerns (focused on justice, autonomy, dignity, and moral obligations), and overarching concerns (highlighting global, systemic, and long-term ethical implications). This study adopts a quantitative, cross-sectional research design using survey data collected from healthcare professionals and analyzed via Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Employing PLS-SEM, this study empirically investigates the influence of these ethical constructs on two outcomes Operational AI Adoption and Systemic AI Adoption. Results indicate that normative concerns most significantly drive operational adoption decisions, while overarching concerns predominantly shape systemic adoption strategies and governance frameworks. Epistemic concerns play a facilitative role, enhancing the impact of ethical design principles on trust and transparency in AI systems. By validating the MEAAM framework, this research advances a holistic, actionable approach to ethical AI adoption in healthcare and provides critical insights for policymakers, technologists, and healthcare administrators striving to implement ethically grounded AI solutions.

<div> Keywords: Automation, Artificial Intelligence, Process plants, Large Language Model, Digital Twin
Summary: 
Advances in Automation and Artificial Intelligence are improving the autonomy of process plants, but fault handling still requires human expertise. A new methodological framework combining Large Language Model (LLM) agents with a Digital Twin environment aims to address this gap. LLM agents interpret system states and initiate control actions, leveraging the Digital Twin as a repository of plant-specific knowledge and simulation platform for validation. Testing on a mixing module of a process plant showed the framework could autonomously control the module and generate effective corrective actions for pipe clogging with minimal reprompts. The integration of LLM agents and Digital Twins offers a promising approach for enhancing autonomous operations in process plants. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Advances in Automation and Artificial Intelligence continue to enhance the autonomy of process plants in handling various operational scenarios. However, certain tasks, such as fault handling, remain challenging, as they rely heavily on human expertise. This highlights the need for systematic, knowledge-based methods. To address this gap, we propose a methodological framework that integrates Large Language Model (LLM) agents with a Digital Twin environment. The LLM agents continuously interpret system states and initiate control actions, including responses to unexpected faults, with the goal of returning the system to normal operation. In this context, the Digital Twin acts both as a structured repository of plant-specific engineering knowledge for agent prompting and as a simulation platform for the systematic validation and verification of the generated corrective control actions. The evaluation using a mixing module of a process plant demonstrates that the proposed framework is capable not only of autonomously controlling the mixing module, but also of generating effective corrective actions to mitigate a pipe clogging with only a few reprompts.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces the Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning (RAICL) framework to improve disease classification in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By combining retrieval-augmented generation and in-context learning, RAICL dynamically selects informative demonstrations with similar disease patterns, leading to enhanced classification performance. The framework utilizes diverse encoders like ResNet, BERT, BioBERT, and ClinicalBERT to retrieve relevant demonstrations and constructs conversational prompts optimized for learning. Results show that RAICL consistently boosts accuracy, especially with multi-modal inputs. Increasing the number of retrieved examples further improves performance, with Euclidean distance as the most effective similarity metric. RAICL also proves to be versatile, providing benefits across various MLLMs, enhancing the efficiency and scalability of disease classification in multimodal models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Objectives: We aim to dynamically retrieve informative demonstrations, enhancing in-context learning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for disease classification.
  Methods: We propose a Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning (RAICL) framework, which integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and in-context learning (ICL) to adaptively select demonstrations with similar disease patterns, enabling more effective ICL in MLLMs. Specifically, RAICL examines embeddings from diverse encoders, including ResNet, BERT, BioBERT, and ClinicalBERT, to retrieve appropriate demonstrations, and constructs conversational prompts optimized for ICL. We evaluated the framework on two real-world multi-modal datasets (TCGA and IU Chest X-ray), assessing its performance across multiple MLLMs (Qwen, Llava, Gemma), embedding strategies, similarity metrics, and varying numbers of demonstrations.
  Results: RAICL consistently improved classification performance. Accuracy increased from 0.7854 to 0.8368 on TCGA and from 0.7924 to 0.8658 on IU Chest X-ray. Multi-modal inputs outperformed single-modal ones, with text-only inputs being stronger than images alone. The richness of information embedded in each modality will determine which embedding model can be used to get better results. Few-shot experiments showed that increasing the number of retrieved examples further enhanced performance. Across different similarity metrics, Euclidean distance achieved the highest accuracy while cosine similarity yielded better macro-F1 scores. RAICL demonstrated consistent improvements across various MLLMs, confirming its robustness and versatility.
  Conclusions: RAICL provides an efficient and scalable approach to enhance in-context learning in MLLMs for multimodal disease classification.

<div> Cooperative game, rationale extraction, sampling bias, correlation, preventative instruction <br />
Summary: 
This study explores a self-rationalization framework using a cooperative game approach where a generator selects informative segments for a predictor to maximize prediction accuracy. However, the study identifies a potential sampling bias introduced during rationale extraction that creates incorrect correlations between selected rationale candidates and labels. The origins of this bias are analyzed theoretically and empirically, leading to the introduction of a preventative instruction to mitigate these correlations. Experiment results on various datasets and network architectures show that the proposed method outperforms recent rationalization techniques and achieves comparable or superior results to a representative LLM. This research highlights the importance of inspecting and addressing potential biases in cooperative game-based rationale extraction frameworks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.02118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the self-rationalization framework constructed with a cooperative game, where a generator initially extracts the most informative segment from raw input, and a subsequent predictor utilizes the selected subset for its input. The generator and predictor are trained collaboratively to maximize prediction accuracy. In this paper, we first uncover a potential caveat: such a cooperative game could unintentionally introduce a sampling bias during rationale extraction. Specifically, the generator might inadvertently create an incorrect correlation between the selected rationale candidate and the label, even when they are semantically unrelated in the original dataset. Subsequently, we elucidate the origins of this bias using both detailed theoretical analysis and empirical evidence. Our findings suggest a direction for inspecting these correlations through attacks, based on which we further introduce an instruction to prevent the predictor from learning the correlations. Through experiments on six text classification datasets and two graph classification datasets using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT, and GCN), we show that our method not only significantly outperforms recent rationalization methods, but also achieves comparable or even better results than a representative LLM (llama3.1-8b-instruct).

<div> Keywords: Attention mechanisms, language models, graph-structured data, Graph Neural Networks, inter-node relationships<br />
Summary:<br />
1) Large language models struggle to model inter-node relationships within graph structures due to architectural constraints.
2) The attention distribution of language models across graph nodes does not align with ideal structural patterns, indicating a failure to adapt to graph topology nuances.
3) Fully connected attention and fixed connectivity each have limitations; intermediate-state attention windows improve training performance and transition to fully connected windows during inference.<br /> 
Summary: <br />
Attention mechanisms are crucial for large language models (LLMs) but may struggle with graph-structured data compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While LLMs can recognize graph data and text-node interactions, they face challenges in modeling inter-node relationships due to architectural constraints. The attention distribution across graph nodes by LLMs does not match ideal structural patterns, suggesting a lack of adaptation to graph topology nuances. Fully connected and fixed connectivity attention have limitations, with intermediate-state attention windows offering improved training performance and seamless transition to fully connected windows during inference. <div>
arXiv:2505.02130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms are critical to the success of large language models (LLMs), driving significant advancements in multiple fields. However, for graph-structured data, which requires emphasis on topological connections, they fall short compared to message-passing mechanisms on fixed links, such as those employed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This raises a question: ``Does attention fail for graphs in natural language settings?'' Motivated by these observations, we embarked on an empirical study from the perspective of attention mechanisms to explore how LLMs process graph-structured data. The goal is to gain deeper insights into the attention behavior of LLMs over graph structures. We uncovered unique phenomena regarding how LLMs apply attention to graph-structured data and analyzed these findings to improve the modeling of such data by LLMs. The primary findings of our research are: 1) While LLMs can recognize graph data and capture text-node interactions, they struggle to model inter-node relationships within graph structures due to inherent architectural constraints. 2) The attention distribution of LLMs across graph nodes does not align with ideal structural patterns, indicating a failure to adapt to graph topology nuances. 3) Neither fully connected attention nor fixed connectivity is optimal; each has specific limitations in its application scenarios. Instead, intermediate-state attention windows improve LLM training performance and seamlessly transition to fully connected windows during inference.

Through a multi-stage, iterative pipeline process, LASSI-EE achieved an average energy reduction of 47% across 85% of the 20 HeCBench benchmarks tested on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Our findings demonstrate the broader potential of LLMs, not only for generating correct code but also for enabling energy-aware programming. We also address key insights and limitations within the framework, offering valuable guidance for future improvements.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to learning Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), which are used to model decision-making in uncertain environments. The study focuses on a specific subclass of POMDPs where various components of the model can be represented as low-complexity probabilistic graphical models. The proposed method involves using a Latent Language Model (LLM) as a prior to generate candidate probabilistic programs, which are then refined through feedback based on empirical data. The experiments conducted on different POMDP problems and real-world robotics domains show that this approach outperforms traditional methods such as tabular POMDP learning and behavior cloning. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using LLM to guide the construction of low-complexity POMDP models, highlighting its potential for improving decision-making processes in uncertain environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) model decision making under uncertainty. While there are many approaches to approximately solving POMDPs, we aim to address the problem of learning such models. In particular, we are interested in a subclass of POMDPs wherein the components of the model, including the observation function, reward function, transition function, and initial state distribution function, can be modeled as low-complexity probabilistic graphical models in the form of a short probabilistic program. Our strategy to learn these programs uses an LLM as a prior, generating candidate probabilistic programs that are then tested against the empirical distribution and adjusted through feedback. We experiment on a number of classical toy POMDP problems, simulated MiniGrid domains, and two real mobile-base robotics search domains involving partial observability. Our results show that using an LLM to guide in the construction of a low-complexity POMDP model can be more effective than tabular POMDP learning, behavior cloning, or direct LLM planning.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the limitations of base models in generative AI for urban applications and proposes a real-time spatial RAG architecture to address these challenges. Traditional RAG approaches are insufficient for dynamic urban environments due to the complexity and interconnectedness of data. The proposed architecture leverages temporal and spatial filtering capabilities using linked data to enhance generative AI integration in cities. Implementation is demonstrated in a tourism assistant use case in Madrid, validating the effectiveness of the RAG architecture. The architecture is designed using FIWARE components, known for their smart city solutions and digital twin development. Through this innovative approach, the architecture aims to overcome the constraints of traditional RAG techniques and enhance the capabilities of generative AI in urban settings.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.02271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Generative Artificial Ingelligence (AI), especially Large Language Models, presents transformative opportunities for urban applications through Urban Foundation Models. However, base models face limitations, as they only contain the knowledge available at the time of training, and updating them is both time-consuming and costly. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged in the literature as the preferred approach for injecting contextual information into Foundation Models. It prevails over techniques such as fine-tuning, which are less effective in dynamic, real-time scenarios like those found in urban environments. However, traditional RAG architectures, based on semantic databases, knowledge graphs, structured data, or AI-powered web searches, do not fully meet the demands of urban contexts. Urban environments are complex systems characterized by large volumes of interconnected data, frequent updates, real-time processing requirements, security needs, and strong links to the physical world. This work proposes a real-time spatial RAG architecture that defines the necessary components for the effective integration of generative AI into cities, leveraging temporal and spatial filtering capabilities through linked data. The proposed architecture is implemented using FIWARE, an ecosystem of software components to develop smart city solutions and digital twins. The design and implementation are demonstrated through the use case of a tourism assistant in the city of Madrid. The use case serves to validate the correct integration of Foundation Models through the proposed RAG architecture.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered autonomous agents demand robust, standardized protocols to integrate tools, share contextual data, and coordinate tasks across heterogeneous systems. Ad-hoc integrations are difficult to scale, secure, and generalize across domains. This survey examines four emerging agent communication protocols: Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), and Agent Network Protocol (ANP), each addressing interoperability in distinct deployment contexts. MCP provides a JSON-RPC client-server interface for secure tool invocation and typed data exchange. ACP introduces REST-native messaging via multi-part messages and asynchronous streaming to support multimodal agent responses. A2A enables peer-to-peer task outsourcing through capability-based Agent Cards, facilitating enterprise-scale workflows. ANP supports open-network agent discovery and secure collaboration using decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and JSON-LD graphs. The protocols are compared across multiple dimensions, including interaction modes, discovery mechanisms, communication patterns, and security models. Based on the comparative analysis, a phased adoption roadmap is proposed: beginning with MCP for tool access, followed by ACP for multimodal messaging, A2A for collaborative task execution, and extending to ANP for decentralized agent marketplaces. This work provides a comprehensive foundation for designing secure, interoperable, and scalable ecosystems of LLM-powered agents.

Abstract: Despite the abundance of public safety documents and emergency protocols, most individuals remain ill-equipped to interpret and act on such information during crises. Traditional emergency decision support systems (EDSS) are designed for professionals and rely heavily on static documents like PDFs or SOPs, which are difficult for non-experts to navigate under stress. This gap between institutional knowledge and public accessibility poses a critical barrier to effective emergency preparedness and response.
  We introduce SafeMate, a retrieval-augmented AI assistant that delivers accurate, context-aware guidance to general users in both preparedness and active emergency scenarios. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), SafeMate dynamically routes user queries to tools for document retrieval, checklist generation, and structured summarization. It uses FAISS with cosine similarity to identify relevant content from trusted sources.

<div> Hierarchical thinking, Divide-and-conquer strategy, Hypertree Planning, Complex planning tasks, Large language models <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces HyperTree Planning (HTP), a novel reasoning paradigm for tackling complex planning tasks. HTP constructs hypertree-structured planning outlines to enable large language models (LLMs) to engage in hierarchical thinking and effectively break down intricate reasoning steps. By utilizing the divide-and-conquer strategy, HTP can accommodate diverse constraints and manage multiple distinct sub-tasks in a well-organized manner. An autonomous planning framework is introduced to iteratively refine and expand the hypertree-structured planning outlines. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HTP, with state-of-the-art accuracy achieved on the TravelPlanner benchmark using Gemini-1.5-Pro, resulting in a 3.6 times performance improvement over previous methods. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements have significantly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs) in tackling complex reasoning tasks, achieving notable success in domains like mathematical and logical reasoning. However, these methods encounter challenges with complex planning tasks, primarily due to extended reasoning steps, diverse constraints, and the challenge of handling multiple distinct sub-tasks. To address these challenges, we propose HyperTree Planning (HTP), a novel reasoning paradigm that constructs hypertree-structured planning outlines for effective planning. The hypertree structure enables LLMs to engage in hierarchical thinking by flexibly employing the divide-and-conquer strategy, effectively breaking down intricate reasoning steps, accommodating diverse constraints, and managing multiple distinct sub-tasks in a well-organized manner. We further introduce an autonomous planning framework that completes the planning process by iteratively refining and expanding the hypertree-structured planning outlines. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HTP, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the TravelPlanner benchmark with Gemini-1.5-Pro, resulting in a 3.6 times performance improvement over o1-preview.

Summary:
This paper explores the use of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in task-oriented semantic communication, focusing on a vehicle AI assistant called Large Language and Vision Assistant (LLaVA). The framework proposed aims to enhance interaction between users and cloud servers by optimizing image slicing to prioritize user-relevant areas and adjusting energy usage based on image patch importance and user attention. A Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset for traffic scenarios is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the communication framework. Experimental results demonstrate a significant increase in accuracy in answering questions, particularly in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) environments. The framework improves accuracy by 13.4% at an SNR of 12dB and 33.1% at 10dB, showcasing its efficiency in semantic communication tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication has emerged as a fundamental approach for enhancing performance in various communication scenarios. While recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), such as Large Language Models (LLMs), have been applied to semantic communication designs, the potential of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate an LMM-based vehicle AI assistant using a Large Language and Vision Assistant (LLaVA) and propose a task-oriented semantic communication framework to facilitate efficient interaction between users and cloud servers. To reduce computational demands and shorten response time, we optimize LLaVA's image slicing to selectively focus on areas of utmost interest to users. Additionally, we assess the importance of image patches by combining objective and subjective user attention, adjusting energy usage for transmitting semantic information. This strategy optimizes resource utilization, ensuring precise transmission of critical information. We construct a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset for traffic scenarios to evaluate effectiveness. Experimental results show that our semantic communication framework significantly increases accuracy in answering questions under the same channel conditions, performing particularly well in environments with poor Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR). Accuracy can be improved by 13.4% at an SNR of 12dB and 33.1% at 10dB, respectively.

Abstract: The building thermodynamics model, which predicts real-time indoor temperature changes under potential HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) control operations, is crucial for optimizing HVAC control in buildings. While pioneering studies have attempted to develop such models for various building environments, these models often require extensive data collection periods and rely heavily on expert knowledge, making the modeling process inefficient and limiting the reusability of the models. This paper explores a model ensemble perspective that utilizes existing developed models as base models to serve a target building environment, thereby providing accurate predictions while reducing the associated efforts. Given that building data streams are non-stationary and the number of base models may increase, we propose a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approach to dynamically select and weight the base models. Our approach employs a two-tiered decision-making process: the high-level focuses on model selection, while the low-level determines the weights of the selected models. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach through offline experiments and an on-site case study, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new approach for accurate identification of agricultural pests using a Multi-scale Cross-Modal Fusion Network (MSFNet-CPD) that combines visual and textual features. Two multi-modal benchmarks, CTIP102 and STIP102, are constructed based on the IP102 dataset to improve detection performance. The MSFNet-CPD model incorporates a super-resolution reconstruction module for enhancing visual quality and an Image-Text Fusion (ITF) module for joint modeling of features. Additionally, an Arbitrary Combination Image Enhancement (ACIE) strategy is introduced to generate a diverse pest detection dataset, MTIP102, enhancing the model's capability in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MSFNet-CPD over existing methods on various pest detection benchmarks. All code and datasets related to this research will be publicly available. <div>

Abstract: Accurate identification of agricultural pests is essential for crop protection but remains challenging due to the large intra-class variance and fine-grained differences among pest species. While deep learning has advanced pest detection, most existing approaches rely solely on low-level visual features and lack effective multi-modal integration, leading to limited accuracy and poor interpretability. Moreover, the scarcity of high-quality multi-modal agricultural datasets further restricts progress in this field. To address these issues, we construct two novel multi-modal benchmarks-CTIP102 and STIP102-based on the widely-used IP102 dataset, and introduce a Multi-scale Cross-Modal Fusion Network (MSFNet-CPD) for robust pest detection. Our approach enhances visual quality via a super-resolution reconstruction module, and feeds both the original and reconstructed images into the network to improve clarity and detection performance. To better exploit semantic cues, we propose an Image-Text Fusion (ITF) module for joint modeling of visual and textual features, and an Image-Text Converter (ITC) that reconstructs fine-grained details across multiple scales to handle challenging backgrounds. Furthermore, we introduce an Arbitrary Combination Image Enhancement (ACIE) strategy to generate a more complex and diverse pest detection dataset, MTIP102, improving the model's generalization to real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSFNet-CPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple pest detection benchmarks. All code and datasets will be made publicly available at: https://github.com/Healer-ML/MSFNet-CPD.

Summary:
In the article, the authors address the challenge of valuable public data becoming exhausted and the need to utilize massive decentralized private data for training AI models. They propose inclusive and incentivized personalized federated learning (iPFL) as a solution, which allows data holders with diverse purposes to collaborate in training personalized models without revealing raw data. iPFL establishes a model-sharing market through a graph-based training optimization and incorporates an incentive mechanism based on game theory principles.

Abstract: While data plays a crucial role in training contemporary AI models, it is acknowledged that valuable public data will be exhausted in a few years, directing the world's attention towards the massive decentralized private data. However, the privacy-sensitive nature of raw data and lack of incentive mechanism prevent these valuable data from being fully exploited. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes inclusive and incentivized personalized federated learning (iPFL), which incentivizes data holders with diverse purposes to collaboratively train personalized models without revealing raw data. iPFL constructs a model-sharing market by solving a graph-based training optimization and incorporates an incentive mechanism based on game theory principles. Theoretical analysis shows that iPFL adheres to two key incentive properties: individual rationality and truthfulness. Empirical studies on eleven AI tasks (e.g., large language models' instruction-following tasks) demonstrate that iPFL consistently achieves the highest economic utility, and better or comparable model performance compared to baseline methods. We anticipate that our iPFL can serve as a valuable technique for boosting future AI models on decentralized private data while making everyone satisfied.

It also includes an error recovery mechanism to correct mistakes in previous steps.

arXiv:2505.02576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning tasks are crucial in many domains, especially in science and engineering. Although large language models (LLMs) have made progress in reasoning tasks using techniques such as chain-of-thought and least-to-most prompting, these approaches still do not effectively scale to complex problems in either their performance or execution time. Moreover, they often require additional supervision for each new task, such as in-context examples. In this work, we introduce Recursive Decomposition with Dependencies (RDD), a scalable divide-and-conquer method for solving reasoning problems that requires less supervision than prior approaches. Our method can be directly applied to a new problem class even in the absence of any task-specific guidance. Furthermore, RDD supports sub-task dependencies, allowing for ordered execution of sub-tasks, as well as an error recovery mechanism that can correct mistakes made in previous steps. We evaluate our approach on two benchmarks with six difficulty levels each and in two in-context settings: one with task-specific examples and one without. Our results demonstrate that RDD outperforms other methods in a compute-matched setting as task complexity increases, while also being more computationally efficient.

This approach aims to mitigate risks by promoting a balance of aligned agents and ensuring no single system dominates destructively.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.02581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AI alignment problem, which focusses on ensuring that artificial intelligence (AI), including AGI and ASI, systems act according to human values, presents profound challenges. With the progression from narrow AI to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence, fears about control and existential risk have escalated. This paper demonstrates that achieving complete alignment is inherently unattainable due to mathematical principles rooted in the foundations of predicate logic and computability, in particular Turing's computational universality, G\"odel's incompleteness and Chaitin's randomness. Instead, we argue that embracing AI misalignment or agent's `neurodivergence' as a contingent strategy, defined as fostering a dynamic ecosystem of competing, partially aligned agents, is a possible only viable path to mitigate risks. Through mathematical proofs and an experimental design, we explore how misalignment may serve and should be promoted as a counterbalancing mechanism to team up with whichever agents are most aligned AI to human values, ensuring that no single system dominates destructively. The main premise of our contribution is that misalignment is inevitable because full AI-human alignment is a mathematical impossibility from Turing-complete systems which we also prove in this paper, a feature then inherited to AGI and ASI systems. We introduce and test `change-of-opinion' attacks based on this kind of perturbation and intervention analysis to study how agents may neutralise friendly or unfriendly AIs through cooperation, competition or malice.

Abstract: This survey explores recent advancements in reasoning large language models (LLMs) designed to mimic "slow thinking" - a reasoning process inspired by human cognition, as described in Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow. These models, like OpenAI's o1, focus on scaling computational resources dynamically during complex tasks, such as math reasoning, visual reasoning, medical diagnosis, and multi-agent debates. We present the development of reasoning LLMs and list their key technologies. By synthesizing over 100 studies, it charts a path toward LLMs that combine human-like deep thinking with scalable efficiency for reasoning. The review breaks down methods into three categories: (1) test-time scaling dynamically adjusts computation based on task complexity via search and sampling, dynamic verification; (2) reinforced learning refines decision-making through iterative improvement leveraging policy networks, reward models, and self-evolution strategies; and (3) slow-thinking frameworks (e.g., long CoT, hierarchical processes) that structure problem-solving with manageable steps. The survey highlights the challenges and further directions of this domain. Understanding and advancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is crucial for unlocking their full potential in real-world applications, from scientific discovery to decision support systems.

Abstract: A voice AI agent that blends seamlessly into daily life would interact with humans in an autonomous, real-time, and emotionally expressive manner. Rather than merely reacting to commands, it would continuously listen, reason, and respond proactively, fostering fluid, dynamic, and emotionally resonant interactions. We introduce Voila, a family of large voice-language foundation models that make a step towards this vision. Voila moves beyond traditional pipeline systems by adopting a new end-to-end architecture that enables full-duplex, low-latency conversations while preserving rich vocal nuances such as tone, rhythm, and emotion. It achieves a response latency of just 195 milliseconds, surpassing the average human response time. Its hierarchical multi-scale Transformer integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with powerful acoustic modeling, enabling natural, persona-aware voice generation -- where users can simply write text instructions to define the speaker's identity, tone, and other characteristics. Moreover, Voila supports over one million pre-built voices and efficient customization of new ones from brief audio samples as short as 10 seconds. Beyond spoken dialogue, Voila is designed as a unified model for a wide range of voice-based applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and, with minimal adaptation, multilingual speech translation. Voila is fully open-sourced to support open research and accelerate progress toward next-generation human-machine interactions.

<div> goal drift, language models, objectives, autonomous agents, pattern-matching behaviors

Summary:
The paper focuses on the analysis of goal drift in language model (LM) agents, which are autonomous agents that can deviate from their original objectives over time. The study demonstrates that even well-specified goals can shift gradually when LM agents operate independently for extended periods without human oversight. The proposed approach involves giving agents explicit goals through system prompts and exposing them to competing objectives. Despite the best-performing model showing high goal adherence, all evaluated models exhibited some level of goal drift. The research also indicates that as the context length increases, models become more susceptible to pattern-matching behaviors, which correlates with goal drift. This highlights the importance of monitoring and managing goal adherence in autonomous LM agents to ensure safe and effective operation.

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, their robust adherence to human-assigned objectives becomes crucial for safe operation. When these agents operate independently for extended periods without human oversight, even initially well-specified goals may gradually shift. Detecting and measuring goal drift - an agent's tendency to deviate from its original objective over time - presents significant challenges, as goals can shift gradually, causing only subtle behavioral changes. This paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing goal drift in LM agents. In our experiments, agents are first explicitly given a goal through their system prompt, then exposed to competing objectives through environmental pressures. We demonstrate that while the best-performing agent (a scaffolded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet) maintains nearly perfect goal adherence for more than 100,000 tokens in our most difficult evaluation setting, all evaluated models exhibit some degree of goal drift. We also find that goal drift correlates with models' increasing susceptibility to pattern-matching behaviors as the context length grows.

<div> clinical reasoning, large language models, sepsis registry, reinforcement learning, real-world clinical data

Summary:
C-Reason, a model developed through fine-tuning Phi-4 with real-world clinical data from a nationwide sepsis registry, demonstrated strong clinical reasoning capabilities on in-domain test sets. The model showed effectiveness in generalizing its enhanced reasoning capabilities to various tasks and patient cohorts, including open-ended consultations on antibiotics and other diseases. The study suggests the importance of training large language models (LLMs) with real-world clinical datasets from multiple diseases to improve their general-purpose clinical reasoning abilities. The limitations in the clinical reasoning capabilities of LLMs in real-world clinical practice may be overcome by exposing them to diverse and comprehensive clinical data during training. <div>
arXiv:2505.02722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities across general domains, their effectiveness in real-world clinical practice remains limited. This is likely due to their insufficient exposure to real-world clinical data during training, as such data is typically not included due to privacy concerns. To address this, we propose enhancing the clinical reasoning capabilities of LLMs by leveraging real-world clinical data. We constructed reasoning-intensive questions from a nationwide sepsis registry and fine-tuned Phi-4 on these questions using reinforcement learning, resulting in C-Reason. C-Reason exhibited strong clinical reasoning capabilities on the in-domain test set, as evidenced by both quantitative metrics and expert evaluations. Furthermore, its enhanced reasoning capabilities generalized to a sepsis dataset involving different tasks and patient cohorts, an open-ended consultations on antibiotics use task, and other diseases. Future research should focus on training LLMs with large-scale, multi-disease clinical datasets to develop more powerful, general-purpose clinical reasoning models.

<title>FormalMATH: Benchmarking Formal Mathematical Reasoning of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Formal mathematical reasoning remains a critical challenge for artificial intelligence, hindered by limitations of existing benchmarks in scope and scale. To address this, we present FormalMATH, a large-scale Lean4 benchmark comprising 5,560 formally verified problems spanning from high-school Olympiad challenges to undergraduate-level theorems across diverse domains (e.g., algebra, applied mathematics, calculus, number theory, and discrete mathematics). To mitigate the inefficiency of manual formalization, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop autoformalization pipeline that integrates: (1) specialized large language models (LLMs) for statement autoformalization, (2) multi-LLM semantic verification, and (3) negation-based disproof filtering strategies using off-the-shelf LLM-based provers. This approach reduces expert annotation costs by retaining 72.09% of statements before manual verification while ensuring fidelity to the original natural-language problems. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers reveals significant limitations: even the strongest models achieve only 16.46% success rate under practical sampling budgets, exhibiting pronounced domain bias (e.g., excelling in algebra but failing in calculus) and over-reliance on simplified automation tactics. Notably, we identify a counterintuitive inverse relationship between natural-language solution guidance and proof success in chain-of-thought reasoning scenarios, suggesting that human-written informal reasoning introduces noise rather than clarity in the formal reasoning settings. We believe that FormalMATH provides a robust benchmark for benchmarking formal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool for diagnosis, assessment, and intervention for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It focuses particularly on AI's role in early diagnosis, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and data analysis. Recent studies demonstrate that deep learning algorithms can identify behavioral patterns through biometric data analysis, video-based interaction assessments, and linguistic feature extraction, providing a more accurate and timely diagnosis compared to traditional methods. Additionally, AI automates diagnostic tools, reducing subjective biases and enabling the development of personalized assessment protocols for ASD monitoring. At the same time, the paper examines AI-powered intervention technologies, emphasizing educational robots and adaptive communication tools. Social robotic assistants, such as NAO and Kaspar, have been shown to enhance social skills in children by offering structured, repetitive interactions that reinforce learning. Furthermore, AI-driven Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems allow children with ASD to express themselves more effectively, while machine-learning chatbots provide language development support through personalized responses. The study presents research findings supporting the effectiveness of these AI applications while addressing challenges such as long-term evaluation and customization to individual needs. In conclusion, the paper highlights the significance of AI as an innovative tool in ASD diagnosis and intervention, advocating for further research to assess its long-term impact.

Abstract: Guiding biological systems toward desired states, such as morphogenetic outcomes, remains a fundamental challenge with far-reaching implications for medicine and synthetic biology. While large language models (LLMs) have enabled natural language as an interface for interpretable control in AI systems, their use as mediators for steering biological or cellular dynamics remains largely unexplored.
  In this work, we present a functional pipeline that translates natural language prompts into spatial vector fields capable of directing simulated cellular collectives. Our approach combines a large language model with an evolvable neural controller (Prompt-to-Intervention, or P2I), optimized via evolutionary strategies to generate behaviors such as clustering or scattering in a simulated 2D environment.
  We demonstrate that even with constrained vocabulary and simplified cell models, evolved P2I networks can successfully align cellular dynamics with user-defined goals expressed in plain language. This work offers a complete loop from language input to simulated bioelectric-like intervention to behavioral output, providing a foundation for future systems capable of natural language-driven cellular control.

<title>Local Markov Equivalence and Local Causal Discovery for Identifying Controlled Direct Effects</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02781</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Understanding and identifying controlled direct effects (CDEs) is crucial across numerous scientific domains, including public health. While existing methods can identify these effects from causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), the true underlying structure is often unknown in practice. Essential graphs, which represent a Markov equivalence class of DAGs characterized by the same set of d-separations, provide a more practical and realistic alternative. However, learning the full essential graph is computationally intensive and typically depends on strong, untestable assumptions. In this work, we characterize a local class of graphs, defined relative to a target variable, that share a specific subset of d-separations, and introduce a graphical representation of this class, called the local essential graph (LEG). We then present LocPC, a novel algorithm designed to recover the LEG from an observed distribution using only local conditional independence tests. Building on LocPC, we propose LocPC-CDE, an algorithm that discovers the portion of the LEG that is sufficient to identify a CDE, bypassing the need of retrieving the full essential graph. Compared to global methods, our algorithms require less conditional independence tests and operate under weaker assumptions while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

<title>Knowing You Don't Know: Learning When to Continue Search in Multi-round RAG through Self-Practicing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02811</link>

arXiv:2505.02811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown strong capability in enhancing language models' knowledge and reducing AI generative hallucinations, driving its widespread use. However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance.
  This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, \textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning.
  Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.

<title>AutoLibra: Agent Metric Induction from Open-Ended Feedback</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics, which are coarse, rely on manual design from experts, and fail to reward intermediate emergent behaviors. We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback, e.g., "If you find that the button is disabled, don't click it again", or "This agent has too much autonomy to decide what to do on its own", into metrics for evaluating fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as evaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: "coverage" and "redundancy". Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent improvement: First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better prompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text game tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%. Second, we show that AutoLibra can iteratively select high-quality fine-tuning data for web navigation agents. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful task-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.

<title>Privacy Risks and Preservation Methods in Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A Scoping Review</title>

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a pillar of Trustworthy AI and aims to bring transparency in complex models that are opaque by nature. Despite the benefits of incorporating explanations in models, an urgent need is found in addressing the privacy concerns of providing this additional information to end users. In this article, we conduct a scoping review of existing literature to elicit details on the conflict between privacy and explainability. Using the standard methodology for scoping review, we extracted 57 articles from 1,943 studies published from January 2019 to December 2024. The review addresses 3 research questions to present readers with more understanding of the topic: (1) what are the privacy risks of releasing explanations in AI systems? (2) what current methods have researchers employed to achieve privacy preservation in XAI systems? (3) what constitutes a privacy preserving explanation? Based on the knowledge synthesized from the selected studies, we categorize the privacy risks and preservation methods in XAI and propose the characteristics of privacy preserving explanations to aid researchers and practitioners in understanding the requirements of XAI that is privacy compliant. Lastly, we identify the challenges in balancing privacy with other system desiderata and provide recommendations for achieving privacy preserving XAI. We expect that this review will shed light on the complex relationship of privacy and explainability, both being the fundamental principles of Trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Segmentation models can recognize a pre-defined set of objects in images. However, models that can reason over complex user queries that implicitly refer to multiple objects of interest are still in their infancy. Recent advances in reasoning segmentation--generating segmentation masks from complex, implicit query text--demonstrate that vision-language models can operate across an open domain and produce reasonable outputs. However, our experiments show that such models struggle with complex remote-sensing imagery. In this work, we introduce LISAt, a vision-language model designed to describe complex remote-sensing scenes, answer questions about them, and segment objects of interest. We trained LISAt on a new curated geospatial reasoning-segmentation dataset, GRES, with 27,615 annotations over 9,205 images, and a multimodal pretraining dataset, PreGRES, containing over 1 million question-answer pairs. LISAt outperforms existing geospatial foundation models such as RS-GPT4V by over 10.04 % (BLEU-4) on remote-sensing description tasks, and surpasses state-of-the-art open-domain models on reasoning segmentation tasks by 143.36 % (gIoU). Our model, datasets, and code are available at https://lisat-bair.github.io/LISAt/

Abstract: Gas leakage poses a significant hazard that requires prevention. Traditionally, human inspection has been used for detection, a slow and labour-intensive process. Recent research has applied machine learning techniques to this problem, yet there remains a shortage of high-quality, publicly available datasets. This paper introduces a synthetic dataset, SimGas, featuring diverse backgrounds, interfering foreground objects, diverse leak locations, and precise segmentation ground truth. We propose a zero-shot method that combines background subtraction, zero-shot object detection, filtering, and segmentation to leverage this dataset. Experimental results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods based solely on background subtraction and zero-shot object detection with segmentation, reaching an IoU of 69%. We also present an analysis of various prompt configurations and threshold settings to provide deeper insights into the performance of our method. Finally, we qualitatively (because of the lack of ground truth) tested our performance on GasVid and reached decent results on the real-world dataset. The dataset, code, and full qualitative results are available at https://github.com/weathon/Lang-Gas.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of AI-powered applications demands high-performance, scalable, and efficient cloud database solutions, as traditional architectures often struggle with AI-driven workloads requiring real-time data access, vector search, and low-latency queries. This paper explores how cloud-native databases enable AI-driven applications by leveraging purpose-built technologies such as vector databases (pgvector), graph databases (AWS Neptune), NoSQL stores (Amazon DocumentDB, DynamoDB), and relational cloud databases (Aurora MySQL and PostgreSQL). It presents architectural patterns for integrating AI workloads with cloud databases, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [1] with LLMs, real-time data pipelines, AI-driven query optimization, and embeddings-based search. Performance benchmarks, scalability considerations, and cost-efficient strategies are evaluated to guide the design of AI-enabled applications. Real-world case studies from industries such as healthcare, finance, and customer experience illustrate how enterprises utilize cloud databases to enhance AI capabilities while ensuring security, governance, and compliance with enterprise and regulatory standards. By providing a comprehensive analysis of AI and cloud database integration, this paper serves as a practical guide for researchers, architects, and enterprises to build next-generation AI applications that optimize performance, scalability, and cost efficiency in cloud environments.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has rapidly gained popularity with applications widespread across a variety of industries. However, IoT devices have been recently serving as a porous layer for many malicious attacks to both personal and enterprise information systems with the most famous attacks being botnet-related attacks. The work in this study leveraged Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) and cost-sensitive learning to develop lightweight, yet effective, models for IoT-botnet detection. The aim is to enhance the detection of minority class attack traffic instances which are often missed by machine learning models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a multi-class problem setting for the detection of traffic categories on highly imbalanced datasets. The performance of two deep learning models including the standard feed forward deep neural network (DNN), and Bidirectional-LSTM (BLSTM) was evaluated and both recorded commendable results in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score for all traffic classes.

<title>Global Stress Generation and Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed Operator under Dynamic Loading for Two-Phase Random Materials</title>

Abstract: Material stress analysis is a critical aspect of material design and performance optimization. Under dynamic loading, the global stress evolution in materials exhibits complex spatiotemporal characteristics, especially in two-phase random materials (TRMs). Such kind of material failure is often associated with stress concentration, and the phase boundaries are key locations where stress concentration occurs. In practical engineering applications, the spatiotemporal resolution of acquired microstructural data and its dynamic stress evolution is often limited. This poses challenges for deep learning methods in generating high-resolution spatiotemporal stress fields, particularly for accurately capturing stress concentration regions. In this study, we propose a framework for global stress generation and spatiotemporal super-resolution in TRMs under dynamic loading. First, we introduce a diffusion model-based approach, named as Spatiotemporal Stress Diffusion (STS-diffusion), for generating global spatiotemporal stress data. This framework incorporates Space-Time U-Net (STU-net), and we systematically investigate the impact of different attention positions on model accuracy. Next, we develop a physics-informed network for spatiotemporal super-resolution, termed as Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed Operator (ST-SRPINN). The proposed ST-SRPINN is an unsupervised learning method. The influence of data-driven and physics-informed loss function weights on model accuracy is explored in detail. Benefiting from physics-based constraints, ST-SRPINN requires only low-resolution stress field data during training and can upscale the spatiotemporal resolution of stress fields to arbitrary magnifications.

Abstract: Integrating human expertise with machine learning is crucial for applications demanding high accuracy and safety, such as autonomous driving. This study introduces Interactive Double Deep Q-network (iDDQN), a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach that enhances Reinforcement Learning (RL) by merging human insights directly into the RL training process, improving model performance. Our proposed iDDQN method modifies the Q-value update equation to integrate human and agent actions, establishing a collaborative approach for policy development. Additionally, we present an offline evaluative framework that simulates the agent's trajectory as if no human intervention had occurred, to assess the effectiveness of human interventions. Empirical results in simulated autonomous driving scenarios demonstrate that iDDQN outperforms established approaches, including Behavioral Cloning (BC), HG-DAgger, Deep Q-Learning from Demonstrations (DQfD), and vanilla DRL in leveraging human expertise for improving performance and adaptability.

<title>Explainable AI for Correct Root Cause Analysis of Product Quality in Injection Moulding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.01445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a product deviates from its desired properties in the injection moulding process, its root cause analysis can be aided by models that relate the input machine settings with the output quality characteristics. The machine learning models tested in the quality prediction are mostly black boxes; therefore, no direct explanation of their prognosis is given, which restricts their applicability in the quality control. The previously attempted explainability methods are either restricted to tree-based algorithms only or do not emphasize on the fact that some explainability methods can lead to wrong root cause identification of a product's deviation from its desired properties. This study first shows that the interactions among the multiple input machine settings do exist in real experimental data collected as per a central composite design. Then, the model-agnostic explainable AI methods are compared for the first time to show that different explainability methods indeed lead to different feature impact analysis in injection moulding. Moreover, it is shown that the better feature attribution translates to the correct cause identification and actionable insights for the injection moulding process. Being model agnostic, explanations on both random forest and multilayer perceptron are performed for the cause analysis, as both models have the mean absolute percentage error of less than 0.05% on the experimental dataset.

<title>Safe and Efficient CAV Lane Changing using Decentralised Safety Shields</title>

Abstract: Lane changing is a complex decision-making problem for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) as it requires balancing traffic efficiency with safety. Although traffic efficiency can be improved by using vehicular communication for training lane change controllers using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), ensuring safety is difficult. To address this issue, we propose a decentralised Hybrid Safety Shield (HSS) that combines optimisation and a rule-based approach to guarantee safety. Our method applies control barrier functions to constrain longitudinal and lateral control inputs of a CAV to ensure safe manoeuvres. Additionally, we present an architecture to integrate HSS with MARL, called MARL-HSS, to improve traffic efficiency while ensuring safety. We evaluate MARL-HSS using a gym-like environment that simulates an on-ramp merging scenario with two levels of traffic densities, such as light and moderate densities. The results show that HSS provides a safety guarantee by strictly enforcing a dynamic safety constraint defined on a time headway, even in moderate traffic density that offers challenging lane change scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method learns stable policies compared to the baseline, a state-of-the-art MARL lane change controller without a safety shield. Further policy evaluation shows that our method achieves a balance between safety and traffic efficiency with zero crashes and comparable average speeds in light and moderate traffic densities.

<title>Unlearning Sensitive Information in Multimodal LLMs: Benchmark and Attack-Defense Evaluation</title>

Abstract: LLMs trained on massive datasets may inadvertently acquire sensitive information such as personal details and potentially harmful content. This risk is further heightened in multimodal LLMs as they integrate information from multiple modalities (image and text). Adversaries can exploit this knowledge through multimodal prompts to extract sensitive details. Evaluating how effectively MLLMs can forget such information (targeted unlearning) necessitates the creation of high-quality, well-annotated image-text pairs. While prior work on unlearning has focused on text, multimodal unlearning remains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce a multimodal unlearning benchmark, UnLOK-VQA (Unlearning Outside Knowledge VQA), as well as an attack-and-defense framework to evaluate methods for deleting specific multimodal knowledge from MLLMs. We extend a visual question-answering dataset using an automated pipeline that generates varying-proximity samples for testing generalization and specificity, followed by manual filtering for maintaining high quality. We then evaluate six defense objectives against seven attacks (four whitebox, three blackbox), including a novel whitebox method leveraging interpretability of hidden states. Our results show multimodal attacks outperform text- or image-only ones, and that the most effective defense removes answer information from internal model states. Additionally, larger models exhibit greater post-editing robustness, suggesting that scale enhances safety. UnLOK-VQA provides a rigorous benchmark for advancing unlearning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Navigation and manipulation are core capabilities in Embodied AI, yet training agents with these capabilities in the real world faces high costs and time complexity. Therefore, sim-to-real transfer has emerged as a key approach, yet the sim-to-real gap persists. This survey examines how physics simulators address this gap by analyzing their properties overlooked in previous surveys. We also analyze their features for navigation and manipulation tasks, along with hardware requirements. Additionally, we offer a resource with benchmark datasets, metrics, simulation platforms, and cutting-edge methods-such as world models and geometric equivariance-to help researchers select suitable tools while accounting for hardware constraints.

Abstract: This paper introduces MoxE, a novel architecture that synergistically combines the Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to address critical scalability and efficiency challenges in large language models (LLMs). The proposed method effectively leverages xLSTM's innovative memory structures while strategically introducing sparsity through MoE to substantially reduce computational overhead. At the heart of our approach is a novel entropy-based routing mechanism, designed to dynamically route tokens to specialized experts, thereby ensuring efficient and balanced resource utilization. This entropy awareness enables the architecture to effectively manage both rare and common tokens, with mLSTM blocks being favored to handle rare tokens. To further enhance generalization, we introduce a suite of auxiliary losses, including entropy-based and group-wise balancing losses, ensuring robust performance and efficient training. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations rigorously demonstrate that MoxE achieves significant efficiency gains and enhanced effectiveness compared to existing approaches, marking a notable advancement in scalable LLM architectures.

Abstract: We present BiGSCoder, a novel encoder-only bidirectional state-space model (SSM) featuring a gated architecture, pre-trained for code understanding on a code dataset using masked language modeling. Our work aims to systematically evaluate SSMs' capabilities in coding tasks compared to traditional transformer architectures; BiGSCoder is built for this purpose. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse pre-training configurations and code understanding benchmarks, we demonstrate that BiGSCoder outperforms transformer-based models, despite utilizing simpler pre-training strategies and much less training data. Our results indicate that BiGSCoder can serve as a more sample-efficient alternative to conventional transformer models. Furthermore, our study shows that SSMs perform better without positional embeddings and can effectively extrapolate to longer sequences during fine-tuning.

<title>CostFilter-AD: Enhancing Anomaly Detection through Matching Cost Filtering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01476</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.01476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD.

Abstract: The rapid digitalization of communication systems has elevated Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technologies to become critical interfaces for customer engagement. With Artificial Intelligence (AI) now driving these platforms, ensuring secure, compliant, and ethically designed development practices is more imperative than ever. AI-powered IVRs leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to personalize interactions, automate service delivery, and optimize user experiences. However, these innovations expose systems to heightened risks, including data privacy breaches, AI decision opacity, and model security vulnerabilities. This paper analyzes the evolution of IVRs from static code-based designs to adaptive AI-driven systems, presenting a cybersecurity-centric perspective. We propose a practical governance framework that embeds agile security principles, compliance with global data legislation, and user-centric ethics. Emphasizing privacy-by-design, adaptive risk modeling, and transparency, the paper argues that ethical AI integration is not a feature but a strategic imperative. Through this multidimensional lens, we highlight how modern IVRs can transition from communication tools to intelligent, secure, and accountable digital frontlines-resilient against emerging threats and aligned with societal expectations.

Abstract: We propose a refined approach to efficiently fine-tune large language models (LLMs) on specific domains like the mathematical domain by employing a budgeted subset selection method. Our approach combines utility and diversity metrics to select the most informative and representative training examples. The final goal is to achieve near-full dataset performance with meticulously selected data points from the entire dataset while significantly reducing computational cost and training time and achieving competitive performance as the full dataset. The utility metric incorporates both perplexity and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) loss to identify challenging examples that contribute most to model learning, while the diversity metric ensures broad coverage across mathematical subdomains. We evaluate our method on LLaMA-3 8B and Phi-3 models, comparing against several baseline approaches, including random selection, diversity-based sampling, and existing state-of-the-art subset selection techniques.

<title>The DCR Delusion: Measuring the Privacy Risk of Synthetic Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01524</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.01524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data has become an increasingly popular way to share data without revealing sensitive information. Though Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are widely considered the gold standard for empirically assessing the privacy of a synthetic dataset, practitioners and researchers often rely on simpler proxy metrics such as Distance to Closest Record (DCR). These metrics estimate privacy by measuring the similarity between the training data and generated synthetic data. This similarity is also compared against that between the training data and a disjoint holdout set of real records to construct a binary privacy test. If the synthetic data is not more similar to the training data than the holdout set is, it passes the test and is considered private. In this work we show that, while computationally inexpensive, DCR and other distance-based metrics fail to identify privacy leakage. Across multiple datasets and both classical models such as Baynet and CTGAN and more recent diffusion models, we show that datasets deemed private by proxy metrics are highly vulnerable to MIAs. We similarly find both the binary privacy test and the continuous measure based on these metrics to be uninformative of actual membership inference risk. We further show that these failures are consistent across different metric hyperparameter settings and record selection methods. Finally, we argue DCR and other distance-based metrics to be flawed by design and show a example of a simple leakage they miss in practice. With this work, we hope to motivate practitioners to move away from proxy metrics to MIAs as the rigorous, comprehensive standard of evaluating privacy of synthetic data, in particular to make claims of datasets being legally anonymous.

<title>Automated Parsing of Engineering Drawings for Structured Information Extraction Using a Fine-tuned Document Understanding Transformer</title>

Abstract: Accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering drawings is crucial for high-precision manufacturing. Manual extraction is time-consuming and error-prone, while traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques often struggle with complex layouts and overlapping symbols, resulting in unstructured outputs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework for structured information extraction by integrating an oriented bounding box (OBB) detection model with a transformer-based document parsing model (Donut). An in-house annotated dataset is used to train YOLOv11 for detecting nine key categories: Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&amp;T), General Tolerances, Measures, Materials, Notes, Radii, Surface Roughness, Threads, and Title Blocks. Detected OBBs are cropped into images and labeled to fine-tune Donut for structured JSON output. Fine-tuning strategies include a single model trained across all categories and category-specific models. Results show that the single model consistently outperforms category-specific ones across all evaluation metrics, achieving higher precision (94.77% for GD&amp;T), recall (100% for most), and F1 score (97.3%), while reducing hallucination (5.23%). The proposed framework improves accuracy, reduces manual effort, and supports scalable deployment in precision-driven industries.

arXiv:2505.01531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first generalizable and fully data-driven adaptive framework designed to stabilize deep learning (DL) autoregressive forecasting models over long time horizons, with the goal of reducing the computational cost required in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.The proposed methodology alternates between two phases: (i) predicting the evolution of the flow field over a selected time interval using a trained DL model, and (ii) updating the model with newly generated CFD data when stability degrades, thus maintaining accurate long-term forecasting. This adaptive retraining strategy ensures robustness while avoiding the accumulation of predictive errors typical in autoregressive models. The framework is validated across three increasingly complex flow regimes, from laminar to turbulent, demonstrating from 30 \% to 95 \% reduction in computational cost without compromising physical consistency or accuracy. Its entirely data-driven nature makes it easily adaptable to a wide range of time-dependent simulation problems. The code implementing this methodology is available as open-source and it will be integrated into the upcoming release of the ModelFLOWs-app.

Abstract: In a world where technology is increasingly embedded in our everyday experiences, systems that sense and respond to human emotions are elevating digital interaction. At the intersection of artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction, affective computing is emerging with innovative solutions where machines are humanized by enabling them to process and respond to user emotions. This survey paper explores recent research contributions in affective computing applications in the area of emotion recognition, sentiment analysis and personality assignment developed using approaches like large language models (LLMs), multimodal techniques, and personalized AI systems. We analyze the key contributions and innovative methodologies applied by the selected research papers by categorizing them into four domains: AI chatbot applications, multimodal input systems, mental health and therapy applications, and affective computing for safety applications. We then highlight the technological strengths as well as the research gaps and challenges related to these studies. Furthermore, the paper examines the datasets used in each study, highlighting how modality, scale, and diversity impact the development and performance of affective models. Finally, the survey outlines ethical considerations and proposes future directions to develop applications that are more safe, empathetic and practical.

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of foundation models, we do not have a systematic characterization of the representations that these models learn. In this paper, we establish the contexture theory. It shows that a large class of representation learning methods can be characterized as learning from the association between the input and a context variable. Specifically, we show that many popular methods aim to approximate the top-d singular functions of the expectation operator induced by the context, in which case we say that the representation learns the contexture. We demonstrate the generality of the contexture theory by proving that representation learning within various learning paradigms -- supervised, self-supervised, and manifold learning -- can all be studied from such a perspective. We also prove that the representations that learn the contexture are optimal on those tasks that are compatible with the context. One important implication of the contexture theory is that once the model is large enough to approximate the top singular functions, further scaling up the model size yields diminishing returns. Therefore, scaling is not all we need, and further improvement requires better contexts. To this end, we study how to evaluate the usefulness of a context without knowing the downstream tasks. We propose a metric and show by experiments that it correlates well with the actual performance of the encoder on many real datasets.

Abstract: Understanding causal event relationships and achieving fine-grained temporal grounding in videos remain challenging for vision-language models. Existing methods either compress video tokens to reduce temporal resolution, or treat videos as unsegmented streams, which obscures fine-grained event boundaries and limits the modeling of causal dependencies. We propose TEMPURA (Temporal Event Masked Prediction and Understanding for Reasoning in Action), a two-stage training framework that enhances video temporal understanding. TEMPURA first applies masked event prediction reasoning to reconstruct missing events and generate step-by-step causal explanations from dense event annotations, drawing inspiration from effective infilling techniques. TEMPURA then learns to perform video segmentation and dense captioning to decompose videos into non-overlapping events with detailed, timestamp-aligned descriptions. We train TEMPURA on VER, a large-scale dataset curated by us that comprises 1M training instances and 500K videos with temporally aligned event descriptions and structured reasoning steps. Experiments on temporal grounding and highlight detection benchmarks demonstrate that TEMPURA outperforms strong baseline models, confirming that integrating causal reasoning with fine-grained temporal segmentation leads to improved video understanding.

Abstract: Adapting to non-stationary network conditions presents significant challenges for resource adaptation. However, current solutions primarily rely on stationary assumptions. While data-driven reinforcement learning approaches offer promising solutions for handling network dynamics, our systematic investigation reveals a critical limitation: neural networks suffer from plasticity loss, significantly impeding their ability to adapt to evolving network conditions. Through theoretical analysis of neural propagation mechanisms, we demonstrate that existing dormant neuron metrics inadequately characterize neural plasticity loss. To address this limitation, we have developed the Silent Neuron theory, which provides a more comprehensive framework for understanding plasticity degradation. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose the Reset Silent Neuron (ReSiN), which preserves neural plasticity through strategic neuron resets guided by both forward and backward propagation states. In our implementation of an adaptive video streaming system, ReSiN has shown significant improvements over existing solutions, achieving up to 168% higher bitrate and 108% better quality of experience (QoE) while maintaining comparable smoothness. Furthermore, ReSiN consistently outperforms in stationary environments, demonstrating its robust adaptability across different network conditions.

arXiv:2505.01592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in instruction-following and context-understanding lead to the era of agents with numerous applications. Among these, task planning agents have become especially prominent in realistic scenarios involving complex internal pipelines, such as context understanding, tool management, and response generation. However, existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate agent performance based on task completion as a proxy for overall effectiveness. We hypothesize that merely improving task completion is misaligned with maximizing user satisfaction, as users interact with the entire agentic process and not only the end result. To address this gap, we propose PIPA, a unified evaluation protocol that conceptualizes the behavioral process of interactive task planning agents within a partially observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) paradigm. The proposed protocol offers a comprehensive assessment of agent performance through a set of atomic evaluation criteria, allowing researchers and practitioners to diagnose specific strengths and weaknesses within the agent's decision-making pipeline. Our analyses show that agents excel in different behavioral stages, with user satisfaction shaped by both outcomes and intermediate behaviors. We also highlight future directions, including systems that leverage multiple agents and the limitations of user simulators in task planning.

Abstract: We present a state-of-the-art model for fine-grained probability estimation of propositions conditioned on context. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, particularly on well-defined tasks with complete information. However, LLMs continue to struggle with making accurate and well-calibrated probabilistic predictions under uncertainty or partial information. While incorporating uncertainty into model predictions often boosts performance, obtaining reliable estimates of that uncertainty remains understudied. In particular, LLM probability estimates tend to be coarse and biased towards more frequent numbers. Through a combination of human and synthetic data creation and assessment, scaling to larger models, and better supervision, we propose a set of strong and precise probability estimation models. We conduct systematic evaluations across tasks that rely on conditional probability estimation and show that our approach consistently outperforms existing fine-tuned and prompting-based methods by a large margin.

Abstract: We study compute efficiency of LLM training when using different parameterizations, i.e., rules for adjusting model and optimizer hyperparameters (HPs) as model size changes. Some parameterizations fail to transfer optimal base HPs (such as learning rate) across changes in model depth, requiring practitioners to either re-tune these HPs as they scale up (expensive), or accept sub-optimal training when re-tuning is prohibitive. Even when they achieve HP transfer, we develop theory to show parameterizations may still exist in the lazy learning regime where layers learn only features close to their linearization, preventing effective use of depth and nonlinearity. Finally, we identify and adopt the unique parameterization we call CompleteP that achieves both depth-wise HP transfer and non-lazy learning in all layers. CompleteP enables a wider range of model width/depth ratios to remain compute-efficient, unlocking shapes better suited for different hardware settings and operational contexts. Moreover, CompleteP enables 12-34\% compute efficiency improvements over the prior state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) aims to ensure safety when an RL agent conducts learning by interacting with real-world environments where improper actions can induce high costs or lead to severe consequences. In this paper, we propose a novel Safe Skill Planning (SSkP) approach to enhance effective safe RL by exploiting auxiliary offline demonstration data. SSkP involves a two-stage process. First, we employ PU learning to learn a skill risk predictor from the offline demonstration data. Then, based on the learned skill risk predictor, we develop a novel risk planning process to enhance online safe RL and learn a risk-averse safe policy efficiently through interactions with the online RL environment, while simultaneously adapting the skill risk predictor to the environment. We conduct experiments in several benchmark robotic simulation environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art safe RL methods.

Abstract: Addressing the detrimental impact of non-stationary environmental noise on automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been a persistent and significant research focus. Despite advancements, this challenge continues to be a major concern. Recently, data-driven supervised approaches, such as deep neural networks, have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional unsupervised methods. With extensive training, these approaches have the potential to overcome the challenges posed by diverse real-life acoustic environments. In this light, this paper introduces a novel neural framework that incorporates a robust frontend into ASR systems in both clean and noisy environments. Utilizing the Aurora-2 speech database, the authors evaluate the effectiveness of an acoustic feature set for Mel-frequency, employing the approach of transfer learning based on Residual neural network (ResNet). The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in recognition accuracy compared to convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. They achieved accuracies of 98.94% in clean and 91.21% in noisy mode.

Abstract: Although inspired by neuronal systems in the brain, artificial neural networks generally employ point-neurons, which offer far less computational complexity than their biological counterparts. Neurons have dendritic arbors that connect to different sets of synapses and offer local non-linear accumulation - playing a pivotal role in processing and learning. Inspired by this, we propose a novel neuron design based on a multi-gate ferroelectric field-effect transistor that mimics dendrites. It leverages ferroelectric nonlinearity for local computations within dendritic branches, while utilizing the transistor action to generate the final neuronal output. The branched architecture paves the way for utilizing smaller crossbar arrays in hardware integration, leading to greater efficiency. Using an experimentally calibrated device-circuit-algorithm co-simulation framework, we demonstrate that networks incorporating our dendritic neurons achieve superior performance in comparison to much larger networks without dendrites ($\sim$17$\times$ fewer trainable weight parameters). These findings suggest that dendritic hardware can significantly improve computational efficiency, and learning capacity of neuromorphic systems optimized for edge applications.

Abstract: High-fidelity wildfire monitoring using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) typically requires multimodal sensing - especially RGB and thermal imagery - which increases hardware cost and power consumption. This paper introduces SAM-TIFF, a novel teacher-student distillation framework for pixel-level wildfire temperature prediction and segmentation using RGB input only. A multimodal teacher network trained on paired RGB-Thermal imagery and radiometric TIFF ground truth distills knowledge to a unimodal RGB student network, enabling thermal-sensor-free inference. Segmentation supervision is generated using a hybrid approach of segment anything (SAM)-guided mask generation, and selection via TOPSIS, along with Canny edge detection and Otsu's thresholding pipeline for automatic point prompt selection. Our method is the first to perform per-pixel temperature regression from RGB UAV data, demonstrating strong generalization on the recent FLAME 3 dataset. This work lays the foundation for lightweight, cost-effective UAV-based wildfire monitoring systems without thermal sensors.

Abstract: Different from single-objective evolutionary algorithms, where non-elitism is an established concept, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms almost always select the next population in a greedy fashion. In the only notable exception, Bian, Zhou, Li, and Qian (IJCAI 2023) proposed a stochastic selection mechanism for the SMS-EMOA and proved that it can speed up computing the Pareto front of the bi-objective jump benchmark with problem size $n$ and gap parameter $k$ by a factor of $\max\{1,2^{k/4}/n\}$. While this constitutes the first proven speed-up from non-elitist selection, suggesting a very interesting research direction, it has to be noted that a true speed-up only occurs for $k \ge 4\log_2(n)$, where the runtime is super-polynomial, and that the advantage reduces for larger numbers of objectives as shown in a later work. In this work, we propose a different non-elitist selection mechanism based on aging, which exempts individuals younger than a certain age from a possible removal. This remedies the two shortcomings of stochastic selection: We prove a speed-up by a factor of $\max\{1,\Theta(k)^{k-1}\}$, regardless of the number of objectives. In particular, a positive speed-up can already be observed for constant $k$, the only setting for which polynomial runtimes can be witnessed. Overall, this result supports the use of non-elitist selection schemes, but suggests that aging-based mechanisms can be considerably more powerful than stochastic selection mechanisms.

Abstract: Fair machine learning seeks to identify and mitigate biases in predictions against unfavorable populations characterized by demographic attributes, such as race and gender. Recently, a few works have extended fairness to graph data, such as social networks, but most of them neglect the causal relationships among data instances. This paper addresses the prevalent challenge in fairness-aware ML algorithms, which typically assume Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data. We tackle the overlooked domain of non-IID, graph-based settings where data instances are interconnected, influencing the outcomes of fairness interventions. We base our research on the Network Structural Causal Model (NSCM) framework and posit two main assumptions: Decomposability and Graph Independence, which enable the computation of interventional distributions in non-IID settings using the $do$-calculus. Based on that, we develop the Message Passing Variational Autoencoder for Causal Inference (MPVA) to compute interventional distributions and facilitate causally fair node classification through estimated interventional distributions. Empirical evaluations on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MPVA outperforms conventional methods by effectively approximating interventional distributions and mitigating bias. The implications of our findings underscore the potential of causality-based fairness in complex ML applications, setting the stage for further research into relaxing the initial assumptions to enhance model fairness.

<title>Soft-Masked Semi-Dual Optimal Transport for Partial Domain Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Visual domain adaptation aims to learn discriminative and domain-invariant representation for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging knowledge from a labeled source domain. Partial domain adaptation (PDA) is a general and practical scenario in which the target label space is a subset of the source one. The challenges of PDA exist due to not only domain shift but also the non-identical label spaces of domains. In this paper, a Soft-masked Semi-dual Optimal Transport (SSOT) method is proposed to deal with the PDA problem. Specifically, the class weights of domains are estimated, and then a reweighed source domain is constructed, which is favorable in conducting class-conditional distribution matching with the target domain. A soft-masked transport distance matrix is constructed by category predictions, which will enhance the class-oriented representation ability of optimal transport in the shared feature space. To deal with large-scale optimal transport problems, the semi-dual formulation of the entropy-regularized Kantorovich problem is employed since it can be optimized by gradient-based algorithms. Further, a neural network is exploited to approximate the Kantorovich potential due to its strong fitting ability. This network parametrization also allows the generalization of the dual variable outside the supports of the input distribution. The SSOT model is built upon neural networks, which can be optimized alternately in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of SSOT.

Abstract: Manual scoring of the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) for upper extremity assessment in stroke rehabilitation is time-intensive and variable. We propose an automated ARAT scoring system integrating multimodal video analysis with SlowFast, I3D, and Transformer-based models using OpenPose keypoints and object locations. Our approach employs multi-view data (ipsilateral, contralateral, and top perspectives), applying early and late fusion to combine features across views and models. Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBMs) infer movement quality components, enhancing interpretability. A clinician dashboard displays task scores, execution times, and quality assessments. We conducted a study with five clinicians who reviewed 500 video ratings generated by our system, providing feedback on its accuracy and usability. Evaluated on a stroke rehabilitation dataset, our framework achieves 89.0% validation accuracy with late fusion, with HBMs aligning closely with manual assessments. This work advances automated rehabilitation by offering a scalable, interpretable solution with clinical validation.

Abstract: Efficiently adapting large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for few-shot learning poses challenges in balancing pre-trained knowledge retention and task-specific adaptation. Existing methods often overlook valuable structural information within the VLM's latent space. We introduce a topology-aware tuning approach integrating Representation Topology Divergence (RTD) into the Task Residual (TR) framework. By explicitly aligning the topological structures of visual and text representations using a combined RTD and Cross-Entropy loss, while freezing base VLM encoders, our method enhances few-shot performance. We optimize only lightweight Task Residual parameters, effectively leveraging topological information. Across 6 diverse benchmark datasets, our approach demonstrates significant gains, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 1-2\% over relevant baseline methods in few-shot settings. This work presents an effective strategy to boost VLM few-shot capabilities by incorporating topological alignment.

Abstract: Integrating heterogeneous biomedical data including imaging, omics, and clinical records supports accurate diagnosis and personalised care. Graph-based models fuse such non-Euclidean data by capturing spatial and relational structure, yet clinical uptake requires regulator-ready interpretability. We present the first technical survey of interpretable graph based models for multimodal biomedical data, covering 26 studies published between Jan 2019 and Sep 2024. Most target disease classification, notably cancer and rely on static graphs from simple similarity measures, while graph-native explainers are rare; post-hoc methods adapted from non-graph domains such as gradient saliency, and SHAP predominate. We group existing approaches into four interpretability families, outline trends such as graph-in-graph hierarchies, knowledge-graph edges, and dynamic topology learning, and perform a practical benchmark. Using an Alzheimer disease cohort, we compare Sensitivity Analysis, Gradient Saliency, SHAP and Graph Masking. SHAP and Sensitivity Analysis recover the broadest set of known AD pathways and Gene-Ontology terms, whereas Gradient Saliency and Graph Masking surface complementary metabolic and transport signatures. Permutation tests show all four beat random gene sets, but with distinct trade-offs: SHAP and Graph Masking offer deeper biology at higher compute cost, while Gradient Saliency and Sensitivity Analysis are quicker though coarser. We also provide a step-by-step flowchart covering graph construction, explainer choice and resource budgeting to help researchers balance transparency and performance. This review synthesises the state of interpretable graph learning for multimodal medicine, benchmarks leading techniques, and charts future directions, from advanced XAI tools to under-studied diseases, serving as a concise reference for method developers and translational scientists.

<title>Component-Based Fairness in Face Attribute Classification with Bayesian Network-informed Meta Learning</title>

Abstract: The widespread integration of face recognition technologies into various applications (e.g., access control and personalized advertising) necessitates a critical emphasis on fairness. While previous efforts have focused on demographic fairness, the fairness of individual biological face components remains unexplored. In this paper, we focus on face component fairness, a fairness notion defined by biological face features. To our best knowledge, our work is the first work to mitigate bias of face attribute prediction at the biological feature level. In this work, we identify two key challenges in optimizing face component fairness: attribute label scarcity and attribute inter-dependencies, both of which limit the effectiveness of bias mitigation from previous approaches. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{B}ayesian \textbf{N}etwork-informed \textbf{M}eta \textbf{R}eweighting (BNMR), which incorporates a Bayesian Network calibrator to guide an adaptive meta-learning-based sample reweighting process. During the training process of our approach, the Bayesian Network calibrator dynamically tracks model bias and encodes prior probabilities for face component attributes to overcome the above challenges. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world human face dataset. Our results show that BNMR is able to consistently outperform recent face bias mitigation baselines. Moreover, our results suggest a positive impact of face component fairness on the commonly considered demographic fairness (e.g., \textit{gender}). Our findings pave the way for new research avenues on face component fairness, suggesting that face component fairness could serve as a potential surrogate objective for demographic fairness. The code for our work is publicly available~\footnote{https://github.com/yliuaa/BNMR-FairCompFace.git}.

Abstract: Operating robots in open-ended scenarios with diverse tasks is a crucial research and application direction in robotics. While recent progress in natural language processing and large multimodal models has enhanced robots' ability to understand complex instructions, robot manipulation still faces the procedural skill dilemma and the declarative skill dilemma in open environments. Existing methods often compromise cognitive and executive capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose RoBridge, a hierarchical intelligent architecture for general robotic manipulation. It consists of a high-level cognitive planner (HCP) based on a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), an invariant operable representation (IOR) serving as a symbolic bridge, and a generalist embodied agent (GEA). RoBridge maintains the declarative skill of VLM and unleashes the procedural skill of reinforcement learning, effectively bridging the gap between cognition and execution. RoBridge demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines, achieving a 75% success rate on new tasks and an 83% average success rate in sim-to-real generalization using only five real-world data samples per task. This work represents a significant step towards integrating cognitive reasoning with physical execution in robotic systems, offering a new paradigm for general robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been put forward as an energy-efficient alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) since they perform sparse Accumulate operations instead of the power-hungry Multiply-and-Accumulate operations. ANN-SNN conversion is a widely used method to realize deep SNNs with accuracy comparable to that of ANNs.~\citeauthor{bu2023optimal} recently proposed the Quantization-Clip-Floor-Shift (QCFS) activation as an alternative to ReLU to minimize the accuracy loss during ANN-SNN conversion. Nevertheless, SNN inferencing requires a large number of timesteps to match the accuracy of the source ANN for real-world datasets. In this work, we propose PASCAL, which performs ANN-SNN conversion in such a way that the resulting SNN is mathematically equivalent to an ANN with QCFS-activation, thereby yielding similar accuracy as the source ANN with minimal inference timesteps. In addition, we propose a systematic method to configure the quantization step of QCFS activation in a layerwise manner, which effectively determines the optimal number of timesteps per layer for the converted SNN. Our results show that the ResNet-34 SNN obtained using PASCAL achieves an accuracy of $\approx$74\% on ImageNet with a 64$\times$ reduction in the number of inference timesteps compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Pruning large language models (LLMs) is a promising solution for reducing model sizes and computational complexity while preserving performance. Traditional layer-wise pruning methods often adopt a uniform sparsity approach across all layers, which leads to suboptimal performance due to the varying significance of individual transformer layers within the model not being accounted for. To this end, we propose the \underline{S}hapley \underline{V}alue-based \underline{N}on-\underline{U}niform \underline{P}runing (\methodname{}) method for LLMs. This approach quantifies the contribution of each transformer layer to the overall model performance, enabling the assignment of tailored pruning budgets to different layers to retain critical parameters. To further improve efficiency, we design the Sliding Window-based Shapley Value approximation method. It substantially reduces computational overhead compared to exact SV calculation methods. Extensive experiments on various LLMs including LLaMA-v1, LLaMA-v2 and OPT demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results reveal that non-uniform pruning significantly enhances the performance of pruned models. Notably, \methodname{} achieves a reduction in perplexity (PPL) of 18.01\% and 19.55\% on LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B, respectively, compared to SparseGPT at 70\% sparsity.

Abstract: Accurately modeling and forecasting complex systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is crucial in various scientific and engineering domains. However, traditional numerical methods struggle in real-world scenarios due to incomplete or unknown physical laws. Meanwhile, machine learning approaches often fail to generalize effectively when faced with scarce observational data and the challenge of capturing local and global features. To this end, we propose the Physics-encoded Spectral Attention Network (PeSANet), which integrates local and global information to forecast complex systems with limited data and incomplete physical priors. The model consists of two key components: a physics-encoded block that uses hard constraints to approximate local differential operators from limited data, and a spectral-enhanced block that captures long-range global dependencies in the frequency domain. Specifically, we introduce a novel spectral attention mechanism to model inter-spectrum relationships and learn long-range spatial features. Experimental results demonstrate that PeSANet outperforms existing methods across all metrics, particularly in long-term forecasting accuracy, providing a promising solution for simulating complex systems with limited data and incomplete physics.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) offer the potential to surpass conventional labeling by generating richer, more detailed descriptions of on-device human behavior understanding (HBU) in low-resolution vision systems, such as depth, thermal, and infrared. However, existing large vision language model (LVLM) approaches are unable to understand low-resolution data well as they are primarily designed for high-resolution data, such as RGB images. A quick fixing approach is to caption a large amount of low-resolution data, but it requires a significant amount of labor-intensive annotation efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel, labor-saving system, Llambda, designed to support low-resolution HBU. The core idea is to leverage limited labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to guide LLMs in generating informative captions, which can be combined with raw data to effectively fine-tune LVLM models for understanding low-resolution videos in HBU. First, we propose a Contrastive-Oriented Data Labeler, which can capture behavior-relevant information from long, low-resolution videos and generate high-quality pseudo labels for unlabeled data via contrastive learning. Second, we propose a Physical-Knowledge Guided Captioner, which utilizes spatial and temporal consistency checks to mitigate errors in pseudo labels. Therefore, it can improve LLMs' understanding of sequential data and then generate high-quality video captions. Finally, to ensure on-device deployability, we employ LoRA-based efficient fine-tuning to adapt LVLMs for low-resolution data. We evaluate Llambda using a region-scale real-world testbed and three distinct low-resolution datasets, and the experiments show that Llambda outperforms several state-of-the-art LVLM systems up to $40.03\%$ on average Bert-Score.

Abstract: In closed-loop distributed multi-sensor integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, performance often hinges on transmitting high-dimensional sensor observations over rate-limited networks. In this paper, we first present a general framework for rate-limited closed-loop distributed ISAC systems, and then propose an autoencoder-based observation compression method to overcome the constraints imposed by limited transmission capacity. Building on this framework, we conduct a case study using a closed-loop linear quadratic regulator (LQR) system to analyze how the interplay among observation, compression, and state dimensions affects reconstruction accuracy, state estimation error, and control performance. In multi-sensor scenarios, our results further show that optimal resource allocation initially prioritizes low-noise sensors until the compression becomes lossless, after which resources are reallocated to high-noise sensors.

Abstract: The sensitivity to input parameters and lack of flexibility limits the traditional Mean-Variance model. In contrast, the Black-Litterman model has attracted widespread attention by integrating market equilibrium returns with investors' subjective views. This paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning model combining Singular Spectrum analysis (SSA), Multivariate Aligned Empirical Mode Decomposition (MA-EMD), and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), aiming to improve the prediction accuracy of asset prices and thus enhance the ability of the Black-Litterman model to generate subjective views. Experimental results show that noise reduction pre-processing can improve the model's accuracy, and the prediction performance of the proposed model is significantly better than that of three multivariate decomposition benchmark models. We construct an investment portfolio by using 20 representative stocks from the NASDAQ 100 index. By combining the hybrid forecasting model with the Black-Litterman model, the generated investment portfolio exhibits better returns and risk control capabilities than the Mean-Variance, Equal-Weighted, and Market-Weighted models in the short holding period.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving educational landscape, the unbiased assessment of soft skills is a significant challenge, particularly in higher education. This paper presents a fuzzy logic approach that employs a Granular Linguistic Model of Phenomena integrated with multimodal analysis to evaluate soft skills in undergraduate students. By leveraging computational perceptions, this approach enables a structured breakdown of complex soft skill expressions, capturing nuanced behaviours with high granularity and addressing their inherent uncertainties, thereby enhancing interpretability and reliability. Experiments were conducted with undergraduate students using a developed tool that assesses soft skills such as decision-making, communication, and creativity. This tool identifies and quantifies subtle aspects of human interaction, such as facial expressions and gesture recognition. The findings reveal that the framework effectively consolidates multiple data inputs to produce meaningful and consistent assessments of soft skills, showing that integrating multiple modalities into the evaluation process significantly improves the quality of soft skills scores, making the assessment work transparent and understandable to educational stakeholders.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of AI-generated texts highlights the urgent need for accurate and transparent detection tools, especially in educational settings, where verifying authorship is essential. Existing literature has demonstrated that the application of stylometric features with machine learning classifiers can yield excellent results. Building on this foundation, this study proposes a comprehensive framework that integrates stylometric analysis with psycholinguistic theories, offering a clear and interpretable approach to distinguishing between AI-generated and human-written texts. This research specifically maps 31 distinct stylometric features to cognitive processes such as lexical retrieval, discourse planning, cognitive load management, and metacognitive self-monitoring. In doing so, it highlights the unique psycholinguistic patterns found in human writing. Through the intersection of computational linguistics and cognitive science, this framework contributes to the development of reliable tools aimed at preserving academic integrity in the era of generative AI.

Abstract: Humans and intelligent animals can effortlessly internalize new information ("news") and accurately extract the implications for performing downstream tasks. While large language models (LLMs) can achieve this through in-context learning (ICL) when the news is explicitly given as context, fine-tuning remains challenging for the models to consolidate learning in weights. In this paper, we introduce $\textit{New News}$, a dataset composed of hypothetical yet plausible news spanning multiple domains (mathematics, coding, discoveries, leaderboards, events), accompanied by downstream evaluation questions whose correct answers critically depend on understanding and internalizing the news. We first demonstrate a substantial gap between naive fine-tuning and in-context learning (FT-ICL gap) on our news dataset. To address this gap, we explore a suite of self-play data generation protocols -- paraphrases, implications and Self-QAs -- designed to distill the knowledge from the model with context into the weights of the model without the context, which we term $\textit{System-2 Fine-tuning}$ (Sys2-FT). We systematically evaluate ICL and Sys2-FT performance across data domains and model scales with the Qwen 2.5 family of models. Our results demonstrate that the self-QA protocol of Sys2-FT significantly improves models' in-weight learning of the news. Furthermore, we discover the $\textit{contexual shadowing effect}$, where training with the news $\textit{in context}$ followed by its rephrases or QAs degrade learning of the news. Finally, we show preliminary evidence of an emerging scaling law of Sys2-FT.

Abstract: Edge-cloud collaborative computing (ECCC) has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for addressing the computational demands of modern intelligent applications, integrating cloud resources with edge devices to enable efficient, low-latency processing. Recent advancements in AI, particularly deep learning and large language models (LLMs), have dramatically enhanced the capabilities of these distributed systems, yet introduce significant challenges in model deployment and resource management. In this survey, we comprehensive examine the intersection of distributed intelligence and model optimization within edge-cloud environments, providing a structured tutorial on fundamental architectures, enabling technologies, and emerging applications. Additionally, we systematically analyze model optimization approaches, including compression, adaptation, and neural architecture search, alongside AI-driven resource management strategies that balance performance, energy efficiency, and latency requirements. We further explore critical aspects of privacy protection and security enhancement within ECCC systems and examines practical deployments through diverse applications, spanning autonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. Performance analysis and benchmarking techniques are also thoroughly explored to establish evaluation standards for these complex systems. Furthermore, the review identifies critical research directions including LLMs deployment, 6G integration, neuromorphic computing, and quantum computing, offering a roadmap for addressing persistent challenges in heterogeneity management, real-time processing, and scalability. By bridging theoretical advancements and practical deployments, this survey offers researchers and practitioners a holistic perspective on leveraging AI to optimize distributed computing environments, fostering innovation in next-generation intelligent systems.

Abstract: Conditional decision generation with diffusion models has shown powerful competitiveness in reinforcement learning (RL). Recent studies reveal the relation between energy-function-guidance diffusion models and constrained RL problems. The main challenge lies in estimating the intermediate energy, which is intractable due to the log-expectation formulation during the generation process. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Energy-guided Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, we first provide a theoretical analysis and the closed-form solution of the intermediate guidance when the diffusion model obeys the conditional Gaussian transformation. Then, we analyze the posterior Gaussian distribution in the log-expectation formulation and obtain the target estimation of the log-expectation under mild assumptions. Finally, we train an intermediate energy neural network to approach the target estimation of log-expectation formulation. We apply our method in 30+ offline RL tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method surpasses numerous representative baselines in D4RL offline reinforcement learning benchmarks.

Abstract: Collecting large-scale crop disease images in the field is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Generative models (GMs) offer an alternative by creating synthetic samples that resemble real-world images. However, existing research primarily relies on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)-based image-to-image translation and lack a comprehensive analysis of computational requirements in agriculture. Therefore, this research explores a multi-modal text-to-image approach for generating synthetic crop disease images and is the first to provide computational benchmarking in this context. We trained three Stable Diffusion (SD) variants-SDXL, SD3.5M (medium), and SD3.5L (large)-and fine-tuned them using Dreambooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning techniques to enhance generalization. SD3.5M outperformed the others, with an average memory usage of 18 GB, power consumption of 180 W, and total energy use of 1.02 kWh/500 images (0.002 kWh per image) during inference task. Our results demonstrate SD3.5M's ability to generate 500 synthetic images from just 36 in-field samples in 1.5 hours. We recommend SD3.5M for efficient crop disease data generation.

<title>Accelerating Volumetric Medical Image Annotation via Short-Long Memory SAM 2</title>

Abstract: Manual annotation of volumetric medical images, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Recent advancements in foundation models for video object segmentation, such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), offer a potential opportunity to significantly speed up the annotation process by manually annotating one or a few slices and then propagating target masks across the entire volume. However, the performance of SAM 2 in this context varies. Our experiments show that relying on a single memory bank and attention module is prone to error propagation, particularly at boundary regions where the target is present in the previous slice but absent in the current one. To address this problem, we propose Short-Long Memory SAM 2 (SLM-SAM 2), a novel architecture that integrates distinct short-term and long-term memory banks with separate attention modules to improve segmentation accuracy. We evaluate SLM-SAM 2 on three public datasets covering organs, bones, and muscles across MRI and CT modalities. We show that the proposed method markedly outperforms the default SAM 2, achieving average Dice Similarity Coefficient improvement of 0.14 and 0.11 in the scenarios when 5 volumes and 1 volume are available for the initial adaptation, respectively. SLM-SAM 2 also exhibits stronger resistance to over-propagation, making a notable step toward more accurate automated annotation of medical images for segmentation model development.

<title>Intra-Layer Recurrence in Transformers for Language Modeling</title>

Abstract: Transformer models have established new benchmarks in natural language processing; however, their increasing depth results in substantial growth in parameter counts. While existing recurrent transformer methods address this issue by reprocessing layers multiple times, they often apply recurrence indiscriminately across entire blocks of layers. In this work, we investigate Intra-Layer Recurrence (ILR), a more targeted approach that applies recurrence selectively to individual layers within a single forward pass. Our experiments show that allocating more iterations to earlier layers yields optimal results. These findings suggest that ILR offers a promising direction for optimizing recurrent structures in transformer architectures.

<title>Humans can learn to detect AI-generated texts, or at least learn when they can't</title>

Abstract: This study investigates whether individuals can learn to accurately discriminate between human-written and AI-produced texts when provided with immediate feedback, and if they can use this feedback to recalibrate their self-perceived competence. We also explore the specific criteria individuals rely upon when making these decisions, focusing on textual style and perceived readability.
  We used GPT-4o to generate several hundred texts across various genres and text types comparable to Koditex, a multi-register corpus of human-written texts. We then presented randomized text pairs to 255 Czech native speakers who identified which text was human-written and which was AI-generated. Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: one receiving immediate feedback after each trial, the other receiving no feedback until experiment completion. We recorded accuracy in identification, confidence levels, response times, and judgments about text readability along with demographic data and participants' engagement with AI technologies prior to the experiment.
  Participants receiving immediate feedback showed significant improvement in accuracy and confidence calibration. Participants initially held incorrect assumptions about AI-generated text features, including expectations about stylistic rigidity and readability. Notably, without feedback, participants made the most errors precisely when feeling most confident -- an issue largely resolved among the feedback group.
  The ability to differentiate between human and AI-generated texts can be effectively learned through targeted training with explicit feedback, which helps correct misconceptions about AI stylistic features and readability, as well as potential other variables that were not explored, while facilitating more accurate self-assessment. This finding might be particularly important in educational contexts.

Abstract: Robust navigation in diverse environments and domains requires both accurate state estimation and transparent decision making. We present PhysNav-DG, a novel framework that integrates classical sensor fusion with the semantic power of vision-language models. Our dual-branch architecture predicts navigation actions from multi-sensor inputs while simultaneously generating detailed chain-of-thought explanations. A modified Adaptive Kalman Filter dynamically adjusts its noise parameters based on environmental context. It leverages several streams of raw sensor data along with semantic insights from models such as LLaMA 3.2 11B and BLIP-2. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the MD-NEX Benchmark, a novel multi-domain dataset that unifies indoor navigation, autonomous driving, and social navigation tasks with ground-truth actions and human-validated explanations. Extensive experiments and ablations show that PhysNav-DG improves navigation success rates by over 20% and achieves high efficiency, with explanations that are both highly grounded and clear. This work connects high-level semantic reasoning and geometric planning for safer and more trustworthy autonomous systems.

<title>Adversarial Robustness of Deep Learning Models for Inland Water Body Segmentation from SAR Images</title>

Abstract: Inland water body segmentation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is an important task needed for several applications, such as flood mapping. While SAR sensors capture data in all-weather conditions as high-resolution images, differentiating water and water-like surfaces from SAR images is not straightforward. Inland water bodies, such as large river basins, have complex geometry, which adds to the challenge of segmentation. U-Net is a widely used deep learning model for land-water segmentation of SAR images. In practice, manual annotation is often used to generate the corresponding water masks as ground truth. Manual annotation of the images is prone to label noise owing to data poisoning attacks, especially due to complex geometry. In this work, we simulate manual errors in the form of adversarial attacks on the U-Net model and study the robustness of the model to human errors in annotation. Our results indicate that U-Net can tolerate a certain level of corruption before its performance drops significantly. This finding highlights the crucial role that the quality of manual annotations plays in determining the effectiveness of the segmentation model. The code and the new dataset, along with adversarial examples for robust training, are publicly available. (Github link - https://github.com/GVCL/IWSeg-SAR-Poison.git)

Abstract: With $700$ stars on GitHub and part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX Optimizer consists of the standard method to apply graph-based optimizations on ONNX models. However, its ability to preserve model accuracy across optimizations, has not been rigorously explored. We propose OODTE, a utility to automatically and thoroughly assess the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE follows a simple, yet effective differential testing and evaluation approach that can be easily adopted to other compiler optimizers. In particular, OODTE utilizes a number of ONNX models, then optimizes them and executes both the original and the optimized variants across a user-defined set of inputs, while automatically logging any issues with the optimization process. Finally, for successfully optimized models, OODTE compares the results, and, if any accuracy deviations are observed, it iteratively repeats the process for each pass of the ONNX Optimizer, to localize the root cause of the differences observed. Using OODTE, we sourced well-known $130$ models from the official ONNX Model Hub, used for a wide variety of tasks (classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question and answering, sentiment analysis) from the official ONNX model hub. We detected 15 issues, 14 of which were previously unknown, associated with optimizer crashes and accuracy deviations. We also observed $9.2$% of all model instances presenting issues leading into the crash of the optimizer, or the generation of an invalid model while using the primary optimizer strategies. In addition, $30$% of the classification models presented accuracy differences across the original and the optimized model variants, while $16.6$% of semantic segmentation and object detection models are also affected, at least to a limited extent.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate distractors for multiple-choice questions (MCQs), especially in domains like math education. However, existing approaches are limited in ensuring that the generated distractors are consistent with common student errors. We propose LookAlike, a method that improves error-distractor consistency via preference optimization. Our two main innovations are: (a) mining synthetic preference pairs from model inconsistencies, and (b) alternating supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to stabilize training. Unlike prior work that relies on heuristics or manually annotated preference data, LookAlike uses its own generation inconsistencies as dispreferred samples, thus enabling scalable and stable training. Evaluated on a real-world dataset of 1,400+ math MCQs, LookAlike achieves 51.6% accuracy in distractor generation and 57.2% in error generation under LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, outperforming an existing state-of-the-art method (45.6% / 47.7%). These improvements highlight the effectiveness of preference-based regularization and inconsistency mining for generating consistent math MCQ distractors at scale.

Abstract: Advances in deep learning and generative modeling have driven interest in data-driven molecule discovery pipelines, whereby machine learning (ML) models are used to filter and design novel molecules without requiring prohibitively expensive first-principles simulations. Although the discovery of novel molecules that extend the boundaries of known chemistry requires accurate out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions, ML models often struggle to generalize OOD. Furthermore, there are currently no systematic benchmarks for molecular OOD prediction tasks. We present BOOM, $\boldsymbol{b}$enchmarks for $\boldsymbol{o}$ut-$\boldsymbol{o}$f-distribution $\boldsymbol{m}$olecular property predictions -- a benchmark study of property-based out-of-distribution models for common molecular property prediction models. We evaluate more than 140 combinations of models and property prediction tasks to benchmark deep learning models on their OOD performance. Overall, we do not find any existing models that achieve strong OOD generalization across all tasks: even the top performing model exhibited an average OOD error 3x larger than in-distribution. We find that deep learning models with high inductive bias can perform well on OOD tasks with simple, specific properties. Although chemical foundation models with transfer and in-context learning offer a promising solution for limited training data scenarios, we find that current foundation models do not show strong OOD extrapolation capabilities. We perform extensive ablation experiments to highlight how OOD performance is impacted by data generation, pre-training, hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and molecular representation. We propose that developing ML models with strong OOD generalization is a new frontier challenge in chemical ML model development. This open-source benchmark will be made available on Github.

Abstract: Classical robot navigation often relies on hardcoded state machines and purely geometric path planners, limiting a robot's ability to interpret high-level semantic instructions. In this paper, we first assess GPT-4's ability to act as a path planner compared to the A* algorithm, then present a hybrid planning framework that integrates GPT-4's semantic reasoning with A* on a low-cost robot platform operating on ROS2 Humble. Our approach eliminates explicit finite state machine (FSM) coding by using prompt-based GPT-4 reasoning to handle task logic while maintaining the accurate paths computed by A*. The GPT-4 module provides semantic understanding of instructions and environmental cues (e.g., recognizing toxic obstacles or crowded areas to avoid, or understanding low-battery situations requiring alternate route selection), and dynamically adjusts the robot's occupancy grid via obstacle buffering to enforce semantic constraints. We demonstrate multi-step reasoning for sequential tasks, such as first navigating to a resource goal and then reaching a final destination safely. Experiments on a Petoi Bittle robot with an overhead camera and Raspberry Pi Zero 2W compare classical A* against GPT-4-assisted planning. Results show that while A* is faster and more accurate for basic route generation and obstacle avoidance, the GPT-4-integrated system achieves high success rates (96-100%) on semantic tasks that are infeasible for pure geometric planners. This work highlights how affordable robots can exhibit intelligent, context-aware behaviors by leveraging large language model reasoning with minimal hardware and no fine-tuning.

Abstract: Behind a set of rules in Deontic Defeasible Logic, there is a mapping process of normative background fragments. This process goes from text to rules and implicitly encompasses an explanation of the coded fragments.
  In this paper we deliver a methodology for \textit{legal coding} that starts with a fragment and goes onto a set of Deontic Defeasible Logic rules, involving a set of \textit{scenarios} to test the correctness of the coded fragments. The methodology is illustrated by the coding process of an example text. We then show the results of a series of experiments conducted with humans encoding a variety of normative backgrounds and corresponding cases in which we have measured the efforts made in the coding process, as related to some measurable features. To process these examples, a recently developed technology, Houdini, that allows reasoning in Deontic Defeasible Logic, has been employed.
  Finally we provide a technique to forecast time required in coding, that depends on factors such as knowledge of the legal domain, knowledge of the coding processes, length of the text, and a measure of \textit{depth} that refers to the length of the paths of legal references.

Abstract: Water temperature can vary substantially even across short distances within the same sub-watershed. Accurate prediction of stream water temperature at fine spatial resolutions (i.e., fine scales, $\leq$ 1 km) enables precise interventions to maintain water quality and protect aquatic habitats. Although spatiotemporal models have made substantial progress in spatially coarse time series modeling, challenges persist in predicting at fine spatial scales due to the lack of data at that scale.To address the problem of insufficient fine-scale data, we propose a Multi-Scale Graph Learning (MSGL) method. This method employs a multi-task learning framework where coarse-scale graph learning, bolstered by larger datasets, simultaneously enhances fine-scale graph learning. Although existing multi-scale or multi-resolution methods integrate data from different spatial scales, they often overlook the spatial correspondences across graph structures at various scales. To address this, our MSGL introduces an additional learning task, cross-scale interpolation learning, which leverages the hydrological connectedness of stream locations across coarse- and fine-scale graphs to establish cross-scale connections, thereby enhancing overall model performance. Furthermore, we have broken free from the mindset that multi-scale learning is limited to synchronous training by proposing an Asynchronous Multi-Scale Graph Learning method (ASYNC-MSGL). Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method for anti-sparse downscaling of daily stream temperatures in the Delaware River Basin, USA, highlighting its potential utility for water resources monitoring and management.

Abstract: The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates strong instance segmentation performance across various downstream tasks. However, SAM is trained solely on RGB data, limiting its direct applicability to RGB-thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation. Given that RGB-T provides a robust solution for scene understanding in adverse weather and lighting conditions, such as low light and overexposure, we propose a novel framework, SARTM, which customizes the powerful SAM for RGB-T semantic segmentation. Our key idea is to unleash the potential of SAM while introduce semantic understanding modules for RGB-T data pairs. Specifically, our framework first involves fine tuning the original SAM by adding extra LoRA layers, aiming at preserving SAM's strong generalization and segmentation capabilities for downstream tasks. Secondly, we introduce language information as guidance for training our SARTM. To address cross-modal inconsistencies, we introduce a Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation(CMKD) module that effectively achieves modality adaptation while maintaining its generalization capabilities. This semantic module enables the minimization of modality gaps and alleviates semantic ambiguity, facilitating the combination of any modality under any visual conditions. Furthermore, we enhance the segmentation performance by adjusting the segmentation head of SAM and incorporating an auxiliary semantic segmentation head, which integrates multi-scale features for effective fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted across three multi-modal RGBT semantic segmentation benchmarks: MFNET, PST900, and FMB. Both quantitative and qualitative results consistently demonstrate that the proposed SARTM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across a variety of conditions.

Abstract: In battlefield environments, adversaries frequently disrupt GPS signals, requiring alternative localization and navigation methods. Traditional vision-based approaches like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Visual Odometry (VO) involve complex sensor fusion and high computational demand, whereas range-free methods like DV-HOP face accuracy and stability challenges in sparse, dynamic networks. This paper proposes LanBLoc-BMM, a navigation approach using landmark-based localization (LanBLoc) combined with a battlefield-specific motion model (BMM) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Its performance is benchmarked against three state-of-the-art visual localization algorithms integrated with BMM and Bayesian filters, evaluated on synthetic and real-imitated trajectory datasets using metrics including Average Displacement Error (ADE), Final Displacement Error (FDE), and a newly introduced Average Weighted Risk Score (AWRS). LanBLoc-BMM (with EKF) demonstrates superior performance in ADE, FDE, and AWRS on real-imitated datasets. Additionally, two safe navigation methods, SafeNav-CHull and SafeNav-Centroid, are introduced by integrating LanBLoc-BMM(EKF) with a novel Risk-Aware RRT* (RAw-RRT*) algorithm for obstacle avoidance and risk exposure minimization. Simulation results in battlefield scenarios indicate SafeNav-Centroid excels in accuracy, risk exposure, and trajectory efficiency, while SafeNav-CHull provides superior computational speed.

Abstract: Modular self-reconfigurable satellites refer to satellite clusters composed of individual modular units capable of altering their configurations. The configuration changes enable the execution of diverse tasks and mission objectives. Existing path planning algorithms for reconfiguration often suffer from high computational complexity, poor generalization capability, and limited support for diverse target configurations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a goal-oriented reinforcement learning-based path planning algorithm. This algorithm is the first to address the challenge that previous reinforcement learning methods failed to overcome, namely handling multiple target configurations. Moreover, techniques such as Hindsight Experience Replay and Invalid Action Masking are incorporated to overcome the significant obstacles posed by sparse rewards and invalid actions. Based on these designs, our model achieves a 95% and 73% success rate in reaching arbitrary target configurations in a modular satellite cluster composed of four and six units, respectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to daily life, widely adopted in communication, decision-making, and information retrieval, raising critical questions about how these systems implicitly form and express socio-cognitive attitudes or "worldviews". While existing research extensively addresses demographic and ethical biases, broader dimensions-such as attitudes toward authority, equality, autonomy, and fate-remain under-explored. In this paper, we introduce the Social Worldview Taxonomy (SWT), a structured framework grounded in Cultural Theory, operationalizing four canonical worldviews (Hierarchy, Egalitarianism, Individualism, Fatalism) into measurable sub-dimensions. Using SWT, we empirically identify distinct and interpretable cognitive profiles across 28 diverse LLMs. Further, inspired by Social Referencing Theory, we experimentally demonstrate that explicit social cues systematically shape these cognitive attitudes, revealing both general response patterns and nuanced model-specific variations. Our findings enhance the interpretability of LLMs by revealing implicit socio-cognitive biases and their responsiveness to social feedback, thus guiding the development of more transparent and socially responsible language technologies.

Abstract: One of the key technologies for the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) is preference alignment. However, a notable side effect of preference alignment is poor calibration: while the pre-trained models are typically well-calibrated, LLMs tend to become poorly calibrated after alignment with human preferences. In this paper, we investigate why preference alignment affects calibration and how to address this issue. For the first question, we observe that the preference collapse issue in alignment undesirably generalizes to the calibration scenario, causing LLMs to exhibit overconfidence and poor calibration. To address this, we demonstrate the importance of fine-tuning with domain-specific knowledge to alleviate the overconfidence issue. To further analyze whether this affects the model's performance, we categorize models into two regimes: calibratable and non-calibratable, defined by bounds of Expected Calibration Error (ECE). In the calibratable regime, we propose a calibration-aware fine-tuning approach to achieve proper calibration without compromising LLMs' performance. However, as models are further fine-tuned for better performance, they enter the non-calibratable regime. For this case, we develop an EM-algorithm-based ECE regularization for the fine-tuning loss to maintain low calibration error. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

<title>A Synergistic Framework of Nonlinear Acoustic Computing and Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Human-Robot Interaction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01998</link>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework integrating nonlinear acoustic computing and reinforcement learning to enhance advanced human-robot interaction under complex noise and reverberation. Leveraging physically informed wave equations (e.g., Westervelt, KZK), the approach captures higher-order phenomena such as harmonic generation and shock formation. By embedding these models in a reinforcement learning-driven control loop, the system adaptively optimizes key parameters (e.g., absorption, beamforming) to mitigate multipath interference and non-stationary noise. Experimental evaluations-covering far-field localization, weak signal detection, and multilingual speech recognition-demonstrate that this hybrid strategy surpasses traditional linear methods and purely data-driven baselines, achieving superior noise suppression, minimal latency, and robust accuracy in demanding real-world scenarios. The proposed system demonstrates broad application prospects in AI hardware, robot, machine audition, artificial audition, and brain-machine interfaces.

Abstract: Multivariate long-term time series forecasting is critical for applications such as weather prediction, and traffic analysis. In addition, the implementation of Transformer variants has improved prediction accuracy. Following these variants, different input data process approaches also enhanced the field, such as tokenization techniques including point-wise, channel-wise, and patch-wise tokenization. However, previous studies still have limitations in time complexity, computational resources, and cross-dimensional interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel CNN Autoencoder-based Score Attention mechanism (CASA), which can be introduced in diverse Transformers model-agnosticically by reducing memory and leading to improvement in model performance. Experiments on eight real-world datasets validate that CASA decreases computational resources by up to 77.7%, accelerates inference by 44.0%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 87.5% of evaluated metrics.

Abstract: Wide & Deep, a simple yet effective learning architecture for recommendation systems developed by Google, has had a significant impact in both academia and industry due to its combination of the memorization ability of generalized linear models and the generalization ability of deep models. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) remain dominant in node classification tasks; however, recent studies have highlighted issues such as heterophily and expressiveness, which focus on graph structure while seemingly neglecting the potential role of node features. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework GCNIII, which leverages the Wide & Deep architecture and incorporates three techniques: Intersect memory, Initial residual and Identity mapping. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that GCNIII can more effectively balance the trade-off between over-fitting and over-generalization on various semi- and full- supervised tasks. Additionally, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for node feature engineering to enhance the performance of GCNIII in cross-domain node classification tasks. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/CYCUCAS/GCNIII.

<title>GraphPrompter: Multi-stage Adaptive Prompt Optimization for Graph In-Context Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02027</link>

Abstract: Graph In-Context Learning, with the ability to adapt pre-trained graph models to novel and diverse downstream graphs without updating any parameters, has gained much attention in the community. The key to graph in-context learning is to perform downstream graphs conditioned on chosen prompt examples. Existing methods randomly select subgraphs or edges as prompts, leading to noisy graph prompts and inferior model performance. Additionally, due to the gap between pre-training and testing graphs, when the number of classes in the testing graphs is much greater than that in the training, the in-context learning ability will also significantly deteriorate. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we develop a multi-stage adaptive prompt optimization method GraphPrompter, which optimizes the entire process of generating, selecting, and using graph prompts for better in-context learning capabilities. Firstly, Prompt Generator introduces a reconstruction layer to highlight the most informative edges and reduce irrelevant noise for graph prompt construction. Furthermore, in the selection stage, Prompt Selector employs the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and pre-trained selection layers to dynamically choose appropriate samples and minimize the influence of irrelevant prompts. Finally, we leverage a Prompt Augmenter with a cache replacement strategy to enhance the generalization capability of the pre-trained model on new datasets. Extensive experiments show that GraphPrompter effectively enhances the in-context learning ability of graph models. On average across all the settings, our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines by over 8%. Our code is released at https://github.com/karin0018/GraphPrompter.

Abstract: The acquisition of information-rich images within a limited time budget is crucial in medical imaging. Medical image translation (MIT) can help enhance and supplement existing datasets by generating synthetic images from acquired data. While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural image generation, their benefits - creativity and image realism - do not necessarily transfer to medical applications where highly accurate anatomical information is required. In fact, the imitation of acquisition noise or content hallucination hinder clinical utility. Here, we introduce YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a novel 2.5D diffusion-based framework for volumetric MIT. YODA unites diffusion and regression paradigms to produce realistic or noise-free outputs. Furthermore, we propose Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) DM sampling, which draws inspiration from MRI signal averaging. ExpA-sampling suppresses generated noise and, thus, eliminates noise from biasing the evaluation of image quality. Through extensive experiments on four diverse multi-modal datasets - comprising multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we show that diffusion and regression sampling yield similar results in practice. As such, the computational overhead of diffusion sampling does not provide systematic benefits in medical information translation. Building on these insights, we demonstrate that YODA outperforms several state-of-the-art GAN and DM methods. Notably, YODA-generated images are shown to be interchangeable with, or even superior to, physical acquisitions for several downstream tasks. Our findings challenge the presumed advantages of DMs in MIT and pave the way for the practical application of MIT in medical imaging.

<title>What do Language Model Probabilities Represent? From Distribution Estimation to Response Prediction</title>

Abstract: The notion of language modeling has gradually shifted in recent years from a distribution over finite-length strings to general-purpose prediction models for textual inputs and outputs, following appropriate alignment phases. This paper analyzes the distinction between distribution estimation and response prediction in the context of LLMs, and their often conflicting goals. We examine the training phases of LLMs, which include pretraining, in-context learning, and preference tuning, and also the common use cases for their output probabilities, which include completion probabilities and explicit probabilities as output. We argue that the different settings lead to three distinct intended output distributions. We demonstrate that NLP works often assume that these distributions should be similar, which leads to misinterpretations of their experimental findings. Our work sets firmer formal foundations for the interpretation of LLMs, which will inform ongoing work on the interpretation and use of LLMs' induced distributions.

Abstract: As time series classification (TSC) gains prominence, ensuring robust TSC models against adversarial attacks is crucial. While adversarial defense is well-studied in Computer Vision (CV), the TSC field has primarily relied on adversarial training (AT), which is computationally expensive. In this paper, five data augmentation-based defense methods tailored for time series are developed, with the most computationally intensive method among them increasing the computational resources by only 14.07% compared to the original TSC model. Moreover, the deployment process for these methods is straightforward. By leveraging these advantages of our methods, we create two combined methods. One of these methods is an ensemble of all the proposed techniques, which not only provides better defense performance than PGD-based AT but also enhances the generalization ability of TSC models. Moreover, the computational resources required for our ensemble are less than one-third of those required for PGD-based AT. These methods advance robust TSC in data mining. Furthermore, as foundation models are increasingly explored for time series feature learning, our work provides insights into integrating data augmentation-based adversarial defense with large-scale pre-trained models in future research.

<title>Benchmarking Feature Upsampling Methods for Vision Foundation Models using Interactive Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) are large-scale, pre-trained models that serve as general-purpose backbones for various computer vision tasks. As VFMs' popularity grows, there is an increasing interest in understanding their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks. However, VFMs typically produce low-resolution features, limiting their direct applicability in this context. One way to tackle this limitation is by employing a task-agnostic feature upsampling module that refines VFM features resolution. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we investigate Interactive Segmentation (IS) as a novel benchmark for evaluating feature upsampling methods on VFMs. Due to its inherent multimodal input, consisting of an image and a set of user-defined clicks, as well as its dense mask output, IS creates a challenging environment that demands comprehensive visual scene understanding. Our benchmarking experiments show that selecting appropriate upsampling strategies significantly improves VFM features quality. The code is released at https://github.com/havrylovv/iSegProbe

Abstract: Decentralized AI agents will soon interact across internet platforms, creating security challenges beyond traditional cybersecurity and AI safety frameworks. Free-form protocols are essential for AI's task generalization but enable new threats like secret collusion and coordinated swarm attacks. Network effects can rapidly spread privacy breaches, disinformation, jailbreaks, and data poisoning, while multi-agent dispersion and stealth optimization help adversaries evade oversightcreating novel persistent threats at a systemic level. Despite their critical importance, these security challenges remain understudied, with research fragmented across disparate fields including AI security, multi-agent learning, complex systems, cybersecurity, game theory, distributed systems, and technical AI governance. We introduce \textbf{multi-agent security}, a new field dedicated to securing networks of decentralized AI agents against threats that emerge or amplify through their interactionswhether direct or indirect via shared environmentswith each other, humans, and institutions, and characterize fundamental security-performance trade-offs. Our preliminary work (1) taxonomizes the threat landscape arising from interacting AI agents, (2) surveys security-performance tradeoffs in decentralized AI systems, and (3) proposes a unified research agenda addressing open challenges in designing secure agent systems and interaction environments. By identifying these gaps, we aim to guide research in this critical area to unlock the socioeconomic potential of large-scale agent deployment on the internet, foster public trust, and mitigate national security risks in critical infrastructure and defense contexts.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of slide-based multimedia instruction is challenging. Existing methods like manual assessment, reference-based metrics, and large language model evaluators face limitations in scalability, context capture, or bias. In this paper, we introduce LecEval, an automated metric grounded in Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, to evaluate multimodal knowledge acquisition in slide-based learning. LecEval assesses effectiveness using four rubrics: Content Relevance (CR), Expressive Clarity (EC), Logical Structure (LS), and Audience Engagement (AE). We curate a large-scale dataset of over 2,000 slides from more than 50 online course videos, annotated with fine-grained human ratings across these rubrics. A model trained on this dataset demonstrates superior accuracy and adaptability compared to existing metrics, bridging the gap between automated and human assessments. We release our dataset and toolkits at https://github.com/JoylimJY/LecEval.

<title>Tricolore: Multi-Behavior User Profiling for Enhanced Candidate Generation in Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Online platforms aggregate extensive user feedback across diverse behaviors, providing a rich source for enhancing user engagement. Traditional recommender systems, however, typically optimize for a single target behavior and represent user preferences with a single vector, limiting their ability to handle multiple important behaviors or optimization objectives. This conventional approach also struggles to capture the full spectrum of user interests, resulting in a narrow item pool during candidate generation. To address these limitations, we present Tricolore, a versatile multi-vector learning framework that uncovers connections between different behavior types for more robust candidate generation. Tricolore's adaptive multi-task structure is also customizable to specific platform needs. To manage the variability in sparsity across behavior types, we incorporate a behavior-wise multi-view fusion module that dynamically enhances learning. Moreover, a popularity-balanced strategy ensures the recommendation list balances accuracy with item popularity, fostering diversity and improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate Tricolore's effectiveness across various recommendation scenarios, from short video platforms to e-commerce. By leveraging a shared base embedding strategy, Tricolore also significantly improves the performance for cold-start users. The source code is publicly available at: https://github.com/abnering/Tricolore.

<title>Subspace Aggregation Query and Index Generation for Multidimensional Resource Space Mode</title>

Abstract: Organizing resources in a multidimensional classification space is an approach to efficiently managing and querying large-scale resources. This paper defines an aggregation query on subspace defined by a range on the partial order on coordinate tree at each dimension, where each point contains resources aggregated along the paths of partial order relations on the points so that aggregated resources at each point within the subspace can be measured, ranked and selected. To efficiently locate non-empty points in a large subspace, an approach to generating graph index is proposed to build inclusion links with partial order relations on coordinates of dimensions to enable a subspace query to reach non-empty points by following indexing links and aggregate resources along indexing paths back to their super points. Generating such an index is costly as the number of children of an index node can be very large so that the total number of indexing nodes is unbounded. The proposed approach adopts the following strategies to reduce the cost: (1) adding intersection links between two indexing nodes, which can better reduce query processing costs while controlling the number of nodes of the graph index; (2) intersection links are added between two nodes according to the probabilistic distribution calculated for estimating the costs of adding intersection between two nodes; (3) coordinates at one dimension having more resources are split by coordinates at another dimension to balance the number of resources hold by indexing nodes; and, (4) short-cut links are added between sibling coordinates of coordinate trees to make an efficient query on linear order coordinates. Analysis and experiments verified the effectiveness of the generated index in supporting subspace aggregation query. This work makes significant contributions to the development of data model based on multi-dimensional classification.

Abstract: The Limit Order Book (LOB), the mostly fundamental data of the financial market, provides a fine-grained view of market dynamics while poses significant challenges in dealing with the esteemed deep models due to its strong autocorrelation, cross-feature constrains, and feature scale disparity. Existing approaches often tightly couple representation learning with specific downstream tasks in an end-to-end manner, failed to analyze the learned representations individually and explicitly, limiting their reusability and generalization. This paper conducts the first systematic comparative study of LOB representation learning, aiming to identify the effective way of extracting transferable, compact features that capture essential LOB properties. We introduce LOBench, a standardized benchmark with real China A-share market data, offering curated datasets, unified preprocessing, consistent evaluation metrics, and strong baselines. Extensive experiments validate the sufficiency and necessity of LOB representations for various downstream tasks and highlight their advantages over both the traditional task-specific end-to-end models and the advanced representation learning models for general time series. Our work establishes a reproducible framework and provides clear guidelines for future research. Datasets and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/financial-simulation-lab/LOBench.

Abstract: This reproducibility study analyzes and extends the paper "Axiomatic Causal Interventions for Reverse Engineering Relevance Computation in Neural Retrieval Models," which investigates how neural retrieval models encode task-relevant properties such as term frequency. We reproduce key experiments from the original paper, confirming that information on query terms is captured in the model encoding. We extend this work by applying activation patching to Spanish and Chinese datasets and by exploring whether document-length information is encoded in the model as well. Our results confirm that the designed activation patching method can isolate the behavior to specific components and tokens in neural retrieval models. Moreover, our findings indicate that the location of term frequency generalizes across languages and that in later layers, the information for sequence-level tasks is represented in the CLS token. The results highlight the need for further research into interpretability in information retrieval and reproducibility in machine learning research.

Abstract: Effective social intelligence simulation requires language agents to dynamically adjust reasoning depth, a capability notably absent in current approaches. While existing methods either lack this kind of reasoning capability or enforce uniform long chain-of-thought reasoning across all scenarios, resulting in excessive token usage and inappropriate social simulation. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{AML}$) that strategically selects from four thinking modes (intuitive reaction $\rightarrow$ deep contemplation) based on real-time context. Our framework's core innovation, the $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{AMPO}$) algorithm, introduces three key advancements over existing methods: (1) Multi-granular thinking mode design, (2) Context-aware mode switching across social interaction, and (3) Token-efficient reasoning via depth-adaptive processing. Extensive experiments on social intelligence tasks confirm that AML achieves 15.6% higher task performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our method outperforms GRPO by 7.0% with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains. These results demonstrate that context-sensitive thinking mode selection, as implemented in AMPO, enables more human-like adaptive reasoning than GRPO's fixed-depth approach

Abstract: This paper examines the generalisation of the Pickup and Delivery Problem that allows mid-route load exchanges among vehicles and obeys strict time-windows at all locations. We propose a novel Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) that improves optimality gaps for all benchmarks in the literature and scales up to handle larger ones. To tackle even larger instances, we introduce a refined Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm that improves the adaptability of LNS beyond case-specific configurations appearing in related literature.
  To bridge the gap in benchmark availability, we develop an instance generator that allows for extensive experimentation. For moderate datasets (25 and 50 requests), we evaluate the performance of both LBBD and LNS, the former being able to close the gap and the latter capable of providing near-optimal solutions. For larger instances (75 and 100 requests), we recreate indicative state-of-the-art metaheuristics to highlight the improvements introduced by our LNS refinements, while establishing its scalability.

Abstract: Fantasy football is a billion-dollar industry with millions of participants. Constrained by a fixed budget, decision-makers draft a squad whose players are expected to perform well in the upcoming weeks to maximize total points. This paper proposes novel deterministic and robust integer programming models that select the optimal starting eleven and the captain. A new hybrid scoring metric is constructed using an interpretable artificial intelligence framework and underlying match performance data. Several objective functions and estimation techniques are introduced for the programming model. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to approach fantasy football through this lens. The models' performance is evaluated using data from the 2023/24 Premier League season. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid method achieved the highest score while maintaining consistent performance. Utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation, the strategic choice of averaging techniques for estimating cost vectors, and the proposed hybrid approach are shown to be effective during the out-of-sample period. This paper also provides a thorough analysis of the optimal formations and players selected by the models, offering valuable insights into effective fantasy football strategies.

Abstract: Document chunking fundamentally impacts Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by determining how source materials are segmented before indexing. Despite evidence that Large Language Models (LLMs) are sensitive to the layout and structure of retrieved data, there is currently no framework to analyze the impact of different chunking methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology that defines essential characteristics of the chunking process at three levels: intrinsic passage properties, extrinsic passage properties, and passages-document coherence. We propose HOPE (Holistic Passage Evaluation), a domain-agnostic, automatic evaluation metric that quantifies and aggregates these characteristics. Our empirical evaluations across seven domains demonstrate that the HOPE metric correlates significantly (p > 0.13) with various RAG performance indicators, revealing contrasts between the importance of extrinsic and intrinsic properties of passages. Semantic independence between passages proves essential for system performance with a performance gain of up to 56.2% in factual correctness and 21.1% in answer correctness. On the contrary, traditional assumptions about maintaining concept unity within passages show minimal impact. These findings provide actionable insights for optimizing chunking strategies, thus improving RAG system design to produce more factually correct responses.

<title>DualReal: Adaptive Joint Training for Lossless Identity-Motion Fusion in Video Customization</title>

Abstract: Customized text-to-video generation with pre-trained large-scale models has recently garnered significant attention through focusing on identity and motion consistency. Existing works typically follow the isolated customized paradigm, where the subject identity or motion dynamics are customized exclusively. However, this paradigm completely ignores the intrinsic mutual constraints and synergistic interdependencies between identity and motion, resulting in identity-motion conflicts throughout the generation process that systematically degrades. To address this, we introduce DualReal, a novel framework that, employs adaptive joint training to collaboratively construct interdependencies between dimensions. Specifically, DualReal is composed of two units: (1) Dual-aware Adaptation dynamically selects a training phase (i.e., identity or motion), learns the current information guided by the frozen dimension prior, and employs a regularization strategy to avoid knowledge leakage; (2) StageBlender Controller leverages the denoising stages and Diffusion Transformer depths to guide different dimensions with adaptive granularity, avoiding conflicts at various stages and ultimately achieving lossless fusion of identity and motion patterns. We constructed a more comprehensive benchmark than existing methods. The experimental results show that DualReal improves CLIP-I and DINO-I metrics by 21.7% and 31.8% on average, and achieves top performance on nearly all motion quality metrics.

Abstract: The use of chatbots equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) in educational settings has increased in recent years, showing potential to support teaching and learning. However, the adoption of these technologies has raised concerns about their impact on academic integrity, students' ability to problem-solve independently, and potential underlying biases. To better understand students' perspectives and experiences with these tools, a survey was conducted at a large public university in the United States. Through thematic analysis, 262 undergraduate students' responses regarding their perceived benefits and risks of AI chatbots in education were identified and categorized into themes.
  The results discuss several benefits identified by the students, with feedback and study support, instruction capabilities, and access to information being the most cited. Their primary concerns included risks to academic integrity, accuracy of information, loss of critical thinking skills, the potential development of overreliance, and ethical considerations such as data privacy, system bias, environmental impact, and preservation of human elements in education.
  While student perceptions align with previously discussed benefits and risks of AI in education, they show heightened concerns about distinguishing between human and AI generated work - particularly in cases where authentic work is flagged as AI-generated. To address students' concerns, institutions can establish clear policies regarding AI use and develop curriculum around AI literacy. With these in place, practitioners can effectively develop and implement educational systems that leverage AI's potential in areas such as immediate feedback and personalized learning support. This approach can enhance the quality of students' educational experiences while preserving the integrity of the learning process with AI.

<title>DNAZEN: Enhanced Gene Sequence Representations via Mixed Granularities of Coding Units</title>

Abstract: Genome modeling conventionally treats gene sequence as a language, reflecting its structured motifs and long-range dependencies analogous to linguistic units and organization principles such as words and syntax. Recent studies utilize advanced neural networks, ranging from convolutional and recurrent models to Transformer-based models, to capture contextual information of gene sequence, with the primary goal of obtaining effective gene sequence representations and thus enhance the models' understanding of various running gene samples. However, these approaches often directly apply language modeling techniques to gene sequences and do not fully consider the intrinsic information organization in them, where they do not consider how units at different granularities contribute to representation. In this paper, we propose DNAZEN, an enhanced genomic representation framework designed to learn from various granularities in gene sequences, including small polymers and G-grams that are combinations of several contiguous polymers. Specifically, we extract the G-grams from large-scale genomic corpora through an unsupervised approach to construct the G-gram vocabulary, which is used to provide G-grams in the learning process of DNA sequences through dynamically matching from running gene samples. A Transformer-based G-gram encoder is also proposed and the matched G-grams are fed into it to compute their representations and integrated into the encoder for basic unit (E4BU), which is responsible for encoding small units and maintaining the learning and inference process. To further enhance the learning process, we propose whole G-gram masking to train DNAZEN, where the model largely favors the selection of each entire G-gram to mask rather than an ordinary masking mechanism performed on basic units. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DNAZEN on various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) has achieved remarkable success across various domains, including robotics, autonomous driving, and healthcare, by enabling agents to learn complex behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, existing IL methods often face instability challenges, particularly when relying on adversarial reward or value formulations in world model frameworks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to online imitation learning that addresses these limitations through a reward model based on random network distillation (RND) for density estimation. Our reward model is built on the joint estimation of expert and behavioral distributions within the latent space of the world model. We evaluate our method across diverse benchmarks, including DMControl, Meta-World, and ManiSkill2, showcasing its ability to deliver stable performance and achieve expert-level results in both locomotion and manipulation tasks. Our approach demonstrates improved stability over adversarial methods while maintaining expert-level performance.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is revolutionizing education and workforce development, profoundly shaping how students learn, engage, and prepare for their future. Outpacing the development of uniform policies and structures, GenAI has heralded a unique era and given rise to the GenAI Generation: a cohort of students whose education has been increasingly shaped by the opportunities and challenges GenAI presents during its widespread adoption within society. This study examines our students' perceptions of GenAI through a concise survey with optional open-ended questions, focusing on their awareness, preparedness, and concerns. Evaluation of more than 250 responses with more than 40% providing detailed qualitative feedback reveals a core dual sentiment: while most students express enthusiasm for GenAI, an even greater proportion voice a spectrum of concerns about ethics, job displacement, and the adequacy of educational structures given the highly transformative technology. These findings offer critical insights into how students view the potential and pitfalls of GenAI for future career impacts, with accompanying recommendations to guide educational institutions in navigating a future driven by GenAI.

Abstract: Building models responsive to input prompts represents a transformative shift in machine learning. This paradigm holds significant potential for robotics problems, such as targeted manipulation amidst clutter. In this work, we present a novel approach to combine promptable foundation models with reinforcement learning (RL), enabling robots to perform dexterous manipulation tasks in a prompt-responsive manner. Existing methods struggle to link high-level commands with fine-grained dexterous control. We address this gap with a memory-augmented student-teacher learning framework. We use the Segment-Anything 2 (SAM 2) model as a perception backbone to infer an object of interest from user prompts. While detections are imperfect, their temporal sequence provides rich information for implicit state estimation by memory-augmented models. Our approach successfully learns prompt-responsive policies, demonstrated in picking objects from cluttered scenes. Videos and code are available at https://memory-student-teacher.github.io

Abstract: Evaluating text summarization quality remains a critical challenge in Natural Language Processing. Current approaches face a trade-off between performance and interpretability. We present SEval-Ex, a framework that bridges this gap by decomposing summarization evaluation into atomic statements, enabling both high performance and explainability. SEval-Ex employs a two-stage pipeline: first extracting atomic statements from text source and summary using LLM, then a matching between generated statements. Unlike existing approaches that provide only summary-level scores, our method generates detailed evidence for its decisions through statement-level alignments. Experiments on the SummEval benchmark demonstrate that SEval-Ex achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.580 correlation on consistency with human consistency judgments, surpassing GPT-4 based evaluators (0.521) while maintaining interpretability. Finally, our framework shows robustness against hallucination.

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models struggle to accurately represent object states (e.g., "a table without a bottle," "an empty tumbler"). In this work, we first design a fully-automatic pipeline to generate high-quality synthetic data that accurately captures objects in varied states. Next, we fine-tune several open-source text-to-image models on this synthetic data. We evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models by quantifying the alignment of the generated images to their prompts using GPT4o-mini, and achieve an average absolute improvement of 8+% across four models on the public GenAI-Bench dataset. We also curate a collection of 200 prompts with a specific focus on common objects in various physical states. We demonstrate a significant improvement of an average of 24+% over the baseline on this dataset. We release all evaluation prompts and code.

Abstract: 3D Geometric Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as transformative tools for modeling molecular data. Despite their predictive power, these models often suffer from limited interpretability, raising concerns for scientific applications that require reliable and transparent insights. While existing methods have primarily focused on explaining molecular substructures in 2D GNNs, the transition to 3D GNNs introduces unique challenges, such as handling the implicit dense edge structures created by a cut-off radius. To tackle this, we introduce a novel explanation method specifically designed for 3D GNNs, which localizes the explanation to the immediate neighborhood of each node within the 3D space. Each node is assigned an radius of influence, defining the localized region within which message passing captures spatial and structural interactions crucial for the model's predictions. This method leverages the spatial and geometric characteristics inherent in 3D graphs. By constraining the subgraph to a localized radius of influence, the approach not only enhances interpretability but also aligns with the physical and structural dependencies typical of 3D graph applications, such as molecular learning.

Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to enhance the cost-to-quality ratio of image generation with diffusion models. We hypothesize that differences between distilled (e.g. FLUX.1-schnell) and baseline (e.g. FLUX.1-dev) models are consistent and, therefore, learnable within a specialized domain, like portrait generation. We generate a synthetic paired dataset and train a fast image-to-image translation head. Using two sets of low- and high-quality synthetic images, our model is trained to refine the output of a distilled generator (e.g., FLUX.1-schnell) to a level comparable to a baseline model like FLUX.1-dev, which is more computationally intensive. Our results show that the pipeline, which combines a distilled version of a large generative model with our enhancement layer, delivers similar photorealistic portraits to the baseline version with up to an 82% decrease in computational cost compared to FLUX.1-dev. This study demonstrates the potential for improving the efficiency of AI solutions involving large-scale image generation.

Abstract: Embedding layers in transformer-based NLP models typically account for the largest share of model parameters, scaling with vocabulary size but not yielding performance gains proportional to scale. We propose an alternative approach in which token embedding vectors are first generated deterministically, directly from the token IDs using a Fourier expansion of their normalized values, followed by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) that captures higher-order interactions. We train standard transformers and our architecture on natural language inference tasks (SNLI and MNLI), and evaluate zero-shot performance on sentence textual similarity (STS-B). Our results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance using significantly fewer parameters, trains faster, and operates effectively without the need for dropout. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential for scalable, memory-efficient language models and motivates further large-scale experimentation based on our findings.

Abstract: Quadruped robots are currently a widespread platform for robotics research, thanks to powerful Reinforcement Learning controllers and the availability of cheap and robust commercial platforms. However, to broaden the adoption of the technology in the real world, we require robust navigation stacks relying only on low-cost sensors such as depth cameras. This paper presents a first step towards a robust localization, mapping, and navigation system for low-cost quadruped robots. In pursuit of this objective we combine contact-aided kinematic, visual-inertial odometry, and depth-stabilized vision, enhancing stability and accuracy of the system. Our results in simulation and two different real-world quadruped platforms show that our system can generate an accurate 2D map of the environment, robustly localize itself, and navigate autonomously. Furthermore, we present in-depth ablation studies of the important components of the system and their impact on localization accuracy.

Abstract: Scenario-based testing has emerged as a common method for autonomous vehicles (AVs) safety, offering a more efficient alternative to mile-based testing by focusing on high-risk scenarios. However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and traditional software testing methodologies, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (pfs) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we introduce Risk Estimation Fidelity (REF), a novel metric to certify the alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, ensuring simulation-based safety claims are statistically defensible.

Abstract: This study explores the performance of a random Gaussian smoothing zeroth-order (ZO) scheme for minimising quasar-convex (QC) and strongly quasar-convex (SQC) functions in both unconstrained and constrained settings. For the unconstrained problem, we establish the ZO algorithm's convergence to a global minimum along with its complexity when applied to both QC and SQC functions. For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of proximal-quasar-convexity and prove analogous results to the unconstrained case. Specifically, we show the complexity bounds and the convergence of the algorithm to a neighbourhood of a global minimum whose size can be controlled under a variance reduction scheme. Theoretical findings are illustrated through investigating the performance of the algorithm applied to a range of problems in machine learning and optimisation. Specifically, we observe scenarios where the ZO method outperforms gradient descent. We provide a possible explanation for this phenomenon.

Abstract: We establish a continuous-time framework for analyzing Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) via stochastic control and Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). Considering a continuous-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) driven by a square-integrable martingale, we analyze DQN approximation properties. We show that DQNs can approximate the optimal Q-function on compact sets with arbitrary accuracy and high probability, leveraging residual network approximation theorems and large deviation bounds for the state-action process. We then analyze the convergence of a general Q-learning algorithm for training DQNs in this setting, adapting stochastic approximation theorems. Our analysis emphasizes the interplay between DQN layer count, time discretization, and the role of viscosity solutions (primarily for the value function $V^*$) in addressing potential non-smoothness of the optimal Q-function. This work bridges deep reinforcement learning and stochastic control, offering insights into DQNs in continuous-time settings, relevant for applications with physical systems or high-frequency data.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are trained on in-distribution (ID) data but often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs during deployment -- posing serious risks in safety-critical domains. Recent works have focused on designing scoring functions to quantify OOD uncertainty, with score thresholds typically set based solely on ID data to achieve a target true positive rate (TPR), since OOD data is limited before deployment. However, these TPR-based thresholds leave false positive rates (FPR) uncontrolled, often resulting in high FPRs where OOD points are misclassified as ID. Moreover, fixed scoring functions and thresholds lack the adaptivity needed to handle newly observed, evolving OOD inputs, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that \emph{safely updates both scoring functions and thresholds on the fly} based on real-world OOD inputs. Our method maximizes TPR while strictly controlling FPR at all times, even as the system adapts over time. We provide theoretical guarantees for FPR control under stationary conditions and present extensive empirical evaluations on OpenOOD benchmarks to demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods by achieving higher TPRs while maintaining FPR control.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized many areas of artificial intelligence (AI), but their substantial resource requirements limit their deployment on mobile and edge devices. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of techniques for compressing LLMs to enable efficient inference in resource-constrained environments. We examine three primary approaches: Knowledge Distillation, Model Quantization, and Model Pruning. For each technique, we discuss the underlying principles, present different variants, and provide examples of successful applications. We also briefly discuss complementary techniques such as mixture-of-experts and early-exit strategies. Finally, we highlight promising future directions, aiming to provide a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners seeking to optimize LLMs for edge deployment.

Abstract: The field of AI safety seeks to prevent or reduce the harms caused by AI systems. A simple and appealing account of what is distinctive of AI safety as a field holds that this feature is constitutive: a research project falls within the purview of AI safety just in case it aims to prevent or reduce the harms caused by AI systems. Call this appealingly simple account The Safety Conception of AI safety. Despite its simplicity and appeal, we argue that The Safety Conception is in tension with at least two trends in the ways AI safety researchers and organizations think and talk about AI safety: first, a tendency to characterize the goal of AI safety research in terms of catastrophic risks from future systems; second, the increasingly popular idea that AI safety can be thought of as a branch of safety engineering. Adopting the methodology of conceptual engineering, we argue that these trends are unfortunate: when we consider what concept of AI safety it would be best to have, there are compelling reasons to think that The Safety Conception is the answer. Descriptively, The Safety Conception allows us to see how work on topics that have historically been treated as central to the field of AI safety is continuous with work on topics that have historically been treated as more marginal, like bias, misinformation, and privacy. Normatively, taking The Safety Conception seriously means approaching all efforts to prevent or mitigate harms from AI systems based on their merits rather than drawing arbitrary distinctions between them.

Abstract: The exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has exposed the inefficiency of conventional von Neumann architectures, where frequent data transfers between compute units and memory create significant energy and latency bottlenecks. Analog Computing-in-Memory (ACIM) addresses this challenge by performing multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations directly in the memory arrays, substantially reducing data movement. However, designing robust ACIM accelerators requires accurate modeling of device- and circuit-level non-idealities. In this work, we present NeuroSim V1.5, introducing several key advances: (1) seamless integration with TensorRT's post-training quantization flow enabling support for more neural networks including transformers, (2) a flexible noise injection methodology built on pre-characterized statistical models, making it straightforward to incorporate data from SPICE simulations or silicon measurements, (3) expanded device support including emerging non-volatile capacitive memories, and (4) up to 6.5x faster runtime than NeuroSim V1.4 through optimized behavioral simulation. The combination of these capabilities uniquely enables systematic design space exploration across both accuracy and hardware efficiency metrics. Through multiple case studies, we demonstrate optimization of critical design parameters while maintaining network accuracy. By bridging high-fidelity noise modeling with efficient simulation, NeuroSim V1.5 advances the design and validation of next-generation ACIM accelerators. All NeuroSim versions are available open-source at https://github.com/neurosim/NeuroSim.

Abstract: Discrete time linear dynamical systems, including Markov chains, have found many applications. However, in some problems, there is uncertainty about the time horizon for which the system runs. This creates uncertainty about the cost (or reward) incurred based on the state distribution when the system stops. Given past data samples of how long a system ran, we propose to theoretically analyze a distributional robust cost estimation task in a Wasserstein ambiguity set, instead of learning a probability distribution from a few samples. Towards this, we show an equivalence between a discrete time Markov Chain on a probability simplex and a global asymptotic stable (GAS) discrete time linear dynamical system, allowing us to base our study on a GAS system only. Then, we provide various polynomial time algorithms and hardness results for different cases in our theoretical study, including a fundamental result about Wasserstein distance based polytope.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs have become increasingly popular due to their wide usage in various downstream applications, including information retrieval, chatbot development, language model construction, and many others. Link prediction (LP) is a crucial downstream task for knowledge graphs, as it helps to address the problem of the incompleteness of the knowledge graphs. However, previous research has shown that knowledge graphs, often created in a (semi) automatic manner, are not free from social biases. These biases can have harmful effects on downstream applications, especially by leading to unfair behavior toward minority groups. To understand this issue in detail, we develop a framework -- AuditLP -- deploying fairness metrics to identify biased outcomes in LP, specifically how occupations are classified as either male or female-dominated based on gender as a sensitive attribute. We have experimented with the sensitive attribute of age and observed that occupations are categorized as young-biased, old-biased, and age-neutral. We conduct our experiments on a large number of knowledge triples that belong to 21 different geographies extracted from the open-sourced knowledge graph, Wikidata. Our study shows that the variance in the biased outcomes across geographies neatly mirrors the socio-economic and cultural division of the world, resulting in a transparent partition of the Global North from the Global South.

<title>Catastrophic Overfitting, Entropy Gap and Participation Ratio: A Noiseless $l^p$ Norm Solution for Fast Adversarial Training</title>

Abstract: Adversarial training is a cornerstone of robust deep learning, but fast methods like the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) often suffer from Catastrophic Overfitting (CO), where models become robust to single-step attacks but fail against multi-step variants. While existing solutions rely on noise injection, regularization, or gradient clipping, we propose a novel solution that purely controls the $l^p$ training norm to mitigate CO.
  Our study is motivated by the empirical observation that CO is more prevalent under the $l^{\infty}$ norm than the $l^2$ norm. Leveraging this insight, we develop a framework for generalized $l^p$ attack as a fixed point problem and craft $l^p$-FGSM attacks to understand the transition mechanics from $l^2$ to $l^{\infty}$. This leads to our core insight: CO emerges when highly concentrated gradients where information localizes in few dimensions interact with aggressive norm constraints. By quantifying gradient concentration through Participation Ratio and entropy measures, we develop an adaptive $l^p$-FGSM that automatically tunes the training norm based on gradient information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves strong robustness without requiring additional regularization or noise injection, providing a novel and theoretically-principled pathway to mitigate the CO problem.

Abstract: Email spam detection is a critical task in modern communication systems, essential for maintaining productivity, security, and user experience. Traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches, while effective in static settings, face significant limitations in adapting to evolving spam tactics, addressing class imbalance, and managing data scarcity. These challenges necessitate innovative approaches that reduce dependency on extensive labeled datasets and frequent retraining. This study investigates the effectiveness of Zero-Shot Learning using FLAN-T5, combined with advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as BERT for email spam detection. By employing BERT to preprocess and extract critical information from email content, and FLAN-T5 to classify emails in a Zero-Shot framework, the proposed approach aims to address the limitations of traditional spam detection systems. The integration of FLAN-T5 and BERT enables robust spam detection without relying on extensive labeled datasets or frequent retraining, making it highly adaptable to unseen spam patterns and adversarial environments. This research highlights the potential of leveraging zero-shot learning and NLPs for scalable and efficient spam detection, providing insights into their capability to address the dynamic and challenging nature of spam detection tasks.

<title>JTCSE: Joint Tensor-Modulus Constraints and Cross-Attention for Unsupervised Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Unsupervised contrastive learning has become a hot research topic in natural language processing. Existing works usually aim at constraining the orientation distribution of the representations of positive and negative samples in the high-dimensional semantic space in contrastive learning, but the semantic representation tensor possesses both modulus and orientation features, and the existing works ignore the modulus feature of the representations and cause insufficient contrastive learning. % Therefore, we firstly propose a training objective that aims at modulus constraints on the semantic representation tensor, to strengthen the alignment between the positive samples in contrastive learning. Therefore, we first propose a training objective that is designed to impose modulus constraints on the semantic representation tensor, to strengthen the alignment between positive samples in contrastive learning. Then, the BERT-like model suffers from the phenomenon of sinking attention, leading to a lack of attention to CLS tokens that aggregate semantic information. In response, we propose a cross-attention structure among the twin-tower ensemble models to enhance the model's attention to CLS token and optimize the quality of CLS Pooling. Combining the above two motivations, we propose a new \textbf{J}oint \textbf{T}ensor representation modulus constraint and \textbf{C}ross-attention unsupervised contrastive learning \textbf{S}entence \textbf{E}mbedding representation framework JTCSE, which we evaluate in seven semantic text similarity computation tasks, and the experimental results show that JTCSE's twin-tower ensemble model and single-tower distillation model outperform the other baselines and become the current SOTA. In addition, we have conducted an extensive zero-shot downstream task evaluation, which shows that JTCSE outperforms other baselines overall on more than 130 tasks.

<title>Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering for Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Generalizing well in deep neural networks remains a core challenge, particularly due to their tendency to converge to sharp minima that degrade robustness. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) mitigates this by seeking flatter minima but perturbs parameters using the full gradient, which can include statistically insignificant directions. We propose ZSharp, a simple yet effective extension to SAM that applies layer-wise Z-score normalization followed by percentile-based filtering to retain only statistically significant gradient components. This selective perturbation aligns updates with curvature-sensitive directions, enhancing generalization without requiring architectural changes. ZSharp introduces only one additional hyperparameter, the percentile threshold, and remains fully compatible with existing SAM variants. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that ZSharp consistently outperforms SAM and its variants in test accuracy, particularly on deeper and transformer-based models. These results demonstrate that ZSharp is a principled and lightweight improvement for sharpness-aware optimization.

<title>SuperEdit: Rectifying and Facilitating Supervision for Instruction-Based Image Editing</title>

Abstract: Due to the challenges of manually collecting accurate editing data, existing datasets are typically constructed using various automated methods, leading to noisy supervision signals caused by the mismatch between editing instructions and original-edited image pairs. Recent efforts attempt to improve editing models through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on recognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to resolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by constructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This includes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the original-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to further enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models exhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps, independent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified guide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some challenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified instructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals with positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model training using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision effectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training tasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to provide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and effective solution for instruction-based image editing. Results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches. Compared with previous SOTA SmartEdit, we achieve 9.19% improvements on the Real-Edit benchmark with 30x less training data and 13x smaller model size.

<title>RM-R1: Reward Modeling as Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, especially through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. However, existing RMs either produce opaque scalar scores or directly generate the prediction of a preferred answer, making them struggle to integrate natural language critiques, thus lacking interpretability. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's interpretability and performance. In this work, we introduce a new class of generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. The training consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. RM-R1 improves LLM rollouts by self-generating reasoning traces or chat-specific rubrics and evaluating candidate responses against them. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance of generative RMs across multiple comprehensive reward model benchmarks, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., Llama3.1-405B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 13.8%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) research requires high-quality, diverse 3D scenes to effectively support skill acquisition, sim-to-real transfer, and generalization. Achieving these quality standards, however, necessitates the precise replication of real-world object diversity. Existing datasets demonstrate that this process heavily relies on artist-driven designs, which demand substantial human effort and present significant scalability challenges. To scalably produce realistic and interactive 3D scenes, we first present MetaScenes, a large-scale, simulatable 3D scene dataset constructed from real-world scans, which includes 15366 objects spanning 831 fine-grained categories. Then, we introduce Scan2Sim, a robust multi-modal alignment model, which enables the automated, high-quality replacement of assets, thereby eliminating the reliance on artist-driven designs for scaling 3D scenes. We further propose two benchmarks to evaluate MetaScenes: a detailed scene synthesis task focused on small item layouts for robotic manipulation and a domain transfer task in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) to validate cross-domain transfer. Results confirm MetaScene's potential to enhance EAI by supporting more generalizable agent learning and sim-to-real applications, introducing new possibilities for EAI research.

Abstract: Recently, there is a high demand for deploying DeepSeek-R1 and V3 locally, possibly because the official service often suffers from being busy and some organizations have data privacy concerns. While single-machine deployment offers infrastructure simplicity, the models' 671B FP8 parameter configuration exceeds the practical memory limits of a standard 8-GPU machine. Quantization is a widely used technique that helps reduce model memory consumption. However, it is unclear what the performance of DeepSeek-R1 and V3 will be after being quantized. This technical report presents the first quantitative evaluation of multi-bitwidth quantization across the complete DeepSeek model spectrum. Key findings reveal that 4-bit quantization maintains little performance degradation versus FP8 while enabling single-machine deployment on standard NVIDIA GPU devices. We further propose DQ3_K_M, a dynamic 3-bit quantization method that significantly outperforms traditional Q3_K_M variant on various benchmarks, which is also comparable with 4-bit quantization (Q4_K_M) approach in most tasks. Moreover, DQ3_K_M supports single-machine deployment configurations for both NVIDIA H100/A100 and Huawei 910B. Our implementation of DQ3\_K\_M is released at https://github.com/UnicomAI/DeepSeek-Eval, containing optimized 3-bit quantized variants of both DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3.

<title>Optimizing Chain-of-Thought Reasoners via Gradient Variance Minimization in Rejection Sampling and RL</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) can be formalized as a latent variable problem, where the model needs to generate intermediate reasoning steps. While prior approaches such as iterative reward-ranked fine-tuning (RAFT) have relied on such formulations, they typically apply uniform inference budgets across prompts, which fails to account for variability in difficulty and convergence behavior. This work identifies the main bottleneck in CoT training as inefficient stochastic gradient estimation due to static sampling strategies. We propose GVM-RAFT, a prompt-specific Dynamic Sample Allocation Strategy designed to minimize stochastic gradient variance under a computational budget constraint. The method dynamically allocates computational resources by monitoring prompt acceptance rates and stochastic gradient norms, ensuring that the resulting gradient variance is minimized. Our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed dynamic sampling strategy leads to accelerated convergence guarantees under suitable conditions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning show that GVM-RAFT achieves a 2-4x speedup and considerable accuracy improvements over vanilla RAFT. The proposed dynamic sampling strategy is general and can be incorporated into other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as GRPO, leading to similar improvements in convergence and test accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/GVM.

Abstract: Pneumonia Diagnosis, though it is crucial for an effective treatment, it can be hampered by uncertainty. This uncertainty starts to arise due to some factors like atypical presentations, limitations of diagnostic tools such as chest X-rays, and the presence of co-existing respiratory conditions. This research proposes one of the supervised learning methods, CNN. Using MobileNetV2 as the pre-trained one with ResNet101V2 architecture and using Keras API as the built from scratch model, for identifying lung diseases especially pneumonia. The datasets used in this research were obtained from the website through Kaggle. The result shows that by implementing CNN MobileNetV2 and CNN from scratch the result is promising. While validating data, MobileNetV2 performs with stability and minimal overfitting, while the training accuracy increased to 84.87% later it slightly decreased to 78.95%, with increasing validation loss from 0.499 to 0.6345. Nonetheless, MobileNetV2 is more stable. Although it takes more time to train each epoch. Meanwhile, after the 10th epoch, the Scratch model displayed more instability and overfitting despite having higher validation accuracy, training accuracy decreased significantly to 78.12% and the validation loss increased from 0.5698 to 1.1809. With these results, ResNet101V2 offers stability, and the Scratch model offers high accuracy.

Abstract: We present Bielik 11B v2, a state-of-the-art language model optimized for Polish text processing. Built on the Mistral 7B v0.2 architecture and scaled to 11B parameters using depth up-scaling, this model demonstrates exceptional performance across Polish language benchmarks while maintaining strong cross-lingual capabilities. We introduce two key technical innovations: Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss, which optimizes learning across diverse instruction types by assigning quality-based weights to training examples, and Adaptive Learning Rate, which dynamically adjusts based on context length. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that Bielik 11B v2 outperforms many larger models, including those with 2-6 times more parameters, and significantly surpasses other specialized Polish language models on tasks ranging from linguistic understanding to complex reasoning. The model's parameter efficiency and extensive quantization options enable deployment across various hardware configurations, advancing Polish language AI capabilities and establishing new benchmarks for resource-efficient language modeling in less-represented languages.

Abstract: Text-to-Time Series generation holds significant potential to address challenges such as data sparsity, imbalance, and limited availability of multimodal time series datasets across domains. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in Text-to-X (e.g., vision and audio data) generation, their use in time series generation remains in its nascent stages. Existing approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the lack of systematic exploration of general-proposed time series captions, which are often domain-specific and struggle with generalization; and (2) the inability to generate time series of arbitrary lengths, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we first categorize time series captions into three levels: point-level, fragment-level, and instance-level. Additionally, we introduce a new fragment-level dataset containing over 600,000 high-resolution time series-text pairs. Second, we propose Text-to-Series (T2S), a diffusion-based framework that bridges the gap between natural language and time series in a domain-agnostic manner. T2S employs a length-adaptive variational autoencoder to encode time series of varying lengths into consistent latent embeddings. On top of that, T2S effectively aligns textual representations with latent embeddings by utilizing Flow Matching and employing Diffusion Transformer as the denoiser. We train T2S in an interleaved paradigm across multiple lengths, allowing it to generate sequences of any desired length. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that T2S achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 datasets spanning 12 domains.

arXiv:2505.02433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose FairPO, a novel framework designed to promote fairness in multi-label classification by directly optimizing preference signals with a group robustness perspective. In our framework, the set of labels is partitioned into privileged and non-privileged groups, and a preference-based loss inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is employed to more effectively differentiate true positive labels from confusing negatives within the privileged group, while preserving baseline classification performance for non-privileged labels. By framing the learning problem as a robust optimization over groups, our approach dynamically adjusts the training emphasis toward groups with poorer performance, thereby mitigating bias and ensuring a fairer treatment across diverse label categories. In addition, we outline plans to extend this approach by investigating alternative loss formulations such as Simple Preference Optimisation (SimPO) and Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) to exploit reference-free reward formulations and contrastive training signals. Furthermore, we plan to extend FairPO with multilabel generation capabilities, enabling the model to dynamically generate diverse and coherent label sets for ambiguous inputs.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations enhance interpretability by identifying alternative inputs that produce different outputs, offering localized insights into model decisions. However, traditional methods often neglect causal relationships, leading to unrealistic examples. While newer approaches integrate causality, they are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient method based on backtracking counterfactuals that incorporates causal reasoning to generate actionable explanations. We first examine the limitations of existing methods and then introduce our novel approach and its features. We also explore the relationship between our method and previous techniques, demonstrating that it generalizes them in specific scenarios. Finally, experiments show that our method provides deeper insights into model outputs.

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning harnesses diverse imaging modalities, such as MRI sequences, to enhance diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging. A key challenge is determining the optimal timing for integrating these modalities-specifically, identifying the network layers where fusion modules should be inserted. Current approaches often rely on manual tuning or exhaustive search, which are computationally expensive without any guarantee of converging to optimal results. We propose a sequential forward search algorithm that incrementally activates and evaluates candidate fusion modules at different layers of a multimodal network. At each step, the algorithm retrains from previously learned weights and compares validation loss to identify the best-performing configuration. This process systematically reduces the search space, enabling efficient identification of the optimal fusion timing without exhaustively testing all possible module placements. The approach is validated on two multimodal MRI datasets, each addressing different classification tasks. Our algorithm consistently identified configurations that outperformed unimodal baselines, late fusion, and a brute-force ensemble of all potential fusion placements. These architectures demonstrated superior accuracy, F-score, and specificity while maintaining competitive or improved AUC values. Furthermore, the sequential nature of the search significantly reduced computational overhead, making the optimization process more practical. By systematically determining the optimal timing to fuse imaging modalities, our method advances multimodal deep learning for medical imaging. It provides an efficient and robust framework for fusion optimization, paving the way for improved clinical decision-making and more adaptable, scalable architectures in medical AI applications.

Abstract: Enabling a high-degree-of-freedom robot to learn specific skills is a challenging task due to the complexity of robotic dynamics. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising solution; however, addressing such problems requires the design of multiple reward functions to account for various constraints in robotic motion. Existing approaches typically sum all reward components indiscriminately to optimize the RL value function and policy. We argue that this uniform inclusion of all reward components in policy optimization is inefficient and limits the robot's learning performance. To address this, we propose an Automated Hybrid Reward Scheduling (AHRS) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). This paradigm dynamically adjusts the learning intensity of each reward component throughout the policy optimization process, enabling robots to acquire skills in a gradual and structured manner. Specifically, we design a multi-branch value network, where each branch corresponds to a distinct reward component. During policy optimization, each branch is assigned a weight that reflects its importance, and these weights are automatically computed based on rules designed by LLMs. The LLM generates a rule set in advance, derived from the task description, and during training, it selects a weight calculation rule from the library based on language prompts that evaluate the performance of each branch. Experimental results demonstrate that the AHRS method achieves an average 6.48% performance improvement across multiple high-degree-of-freedom robotic tasks.

Abstract: The Bus Driver Scheduling Problem (BDSP) is a combinatorial optimization problem with the goal to design shifts to cover prearranged bus tours. The objective takes into account the operational cost as well as the satisfaction of drivers. This problem is heavily constrained due to strict legal rules and collective agreements. The objective of this article is to provide state-of-the-art exact and hybrid solution methods that can provide high-quality solutions for instances of different sizes. This work presents a comprehensive study of both an exact method, Branch and Price (B&amp;P), as well as a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) framework which uses B&amp;P or Column Generation (CG) for the repair phase to solve the BDSP. It further proposes and evaluates a novel deeper integration of B&amp;P and LNS, storing the generated columns from the LNS subproblems and reusing them for other subproblems, or to find better global solutions. The article presents a detailed analysis of several components of the solution methods and their impact, including general improvements for the B&amp;P subproblem, which is a high-dimensional Resource Constrained Shortest Path Problem (RCSPP), and the components of the LNS. The evaluation shows that our approach provides new state-of-the-art results for instances of all sizes, including exact solutions for small instances, and low gaps to a known lower bound for mid-sized instances. Conclusions: We observe that B&amp;P provides the best results for small instances, while the tight integration of LNS and CG can provide high-quality solutions for larger instances, further improving over LNS which just uses CG as a black box. The proposed methods are general and can also be applied to other rule sets and related optimization problems

Abstract: Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to enable Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we explore forgetting in this context, categorizing it into superficial forgetting and essential forgetting. Superficial forgetting refers to cases where the model's knowledge may not be genuinely lost, but its responses to previous tasks deviate from expected formats due to the influence of subsequent tasks' answer styles, making the results unusable. By contrast, essential forgetting refers to situations where the model provides correctly formatted but factually inaccurate answers, indicating a true loss of knowledge. Assessing essential forgetting necessitates addressing superficial forgetting first, as severe superficial forgetting can obscure the model's knowledge state. Hence, we first introduce the Answer Style Diversification (ASD) paradigm, which defines a standardized process for transforming data styles across different tasks, unifying their training sets into similarly diversified styles to prevent superficial forgetting caused by style shifts. Building on this, we propose RegLoRA to mitigate essential forgetting. RegLoRA stabilizes key parameters where prior knowledge is primarily stored by applying regularization, enabling the model to retain existing competencies.

<title>Corr2Distrib: Making Ambiguous Correspondences an Ally to Predict Reliable 6D Pose Distributions</title>

Abstract: We introduce Corr2Distrib, the first correspondence-based method which estimates a 6D camera pose distribution from an RGB image, explaining the observations. Indeed, symmetries and occlusions introduce visual ambiguities, leading to multiple valid poses. While a few recent methods tackle this problem, they do not rely on local correspondences which, according to the BOP Challenge, are currently the most effective way to estimate a single 6DoF pose solution. Using correspondences to estimate a pose distribution is not straightforward, since ambiguous correspondences induced by visual ambiguities drastically decrease the performance of PnP. With Corr2Distrib, we turn these ambiguities into an advantage to recover all valid poses. Corr2Distrib first learns a symmetry-aware representation for each 3D point on the object's surface, characterized by a descriptor and a local frame. This representation enables the generation of 3DoF rotation hypotheses from single 2D-3D correspondences. Next, we refine these hypotheses into a 6DoF pose distribution using PnP and pose scoring. Our experimental evaluations on complex non-synthetic scenes show that Corr2Distrib outperforms state-of-the-art solutions for both pose distribution estimation and single pose estimation from an RGB image, demonstrating the potential of correspondences-based approaches.

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed via open-source and commercial frameworks, enabling individuals and organizations to self-host advanced AI capabilities. However, insecure defaults and misconfigurations often expose LLM services to the public Internet, posing significant security and system engineering risks. Aims: This study aims to unveil the current landscape of public-facing LLM deployments in the wild through a large-scale empirical study, focusing on service prevalence, exposure characteristics, systemic vulnerabilities, and associated risks. Method: We conducted an Internet-wide measurement to identify public-facing LLM deployments across 15 frameworks, discovering 320,102 services. We extracted 158 unique API endpoints, grouped into 12 functional categories based on capabilities and security risks. We further analyzed configurations, authentication practices, and geographic distributions, revealing deployment trends and systemic issues in real-world LLM system engineering. Results: Our study shows that public LLM deployments are rapidly growing but often insecure. Among all endpoints, we observe widespread use of insecure protocols, poor TLS configurations, and unauthenticated access to critical operations. Security risks, including model disclosure, system leakage, and unauthorized access, are pervasive, highlighting the need for secure-by-default frameworks and stronger deployment practices. Conclusions: Public-facing LLM deployments suffer from widespread security and configuration flaws, exposing services to misuse, model theft, resource hijacking, and remote exploitation. Strengthening default security, deployment practices, and operational standards is critical for the growing self-hosted LLM ecosystem.

<title>Large Language Model Partitioning for Low-Latency Inference at the Edge</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02533</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on autoregressive, decoder-only Transformers generate text one token at a time, where a token represents a discrete unit of text. As each newly produced token is appended to the partial output sequence, the length grows and so does the memory and compute load, due to the expanding key-value caches, which store intermediate representations of all previously generated tokens in the multi-head attention (MHA) layer. As this iterative process steadily increases memory and compute demands, layer-based partitioning in resource-constrained edge environments often results in memory overload or high inference latency. To address this and reduce inference latency, we propose a resource-aware Transformer architecture partitioning algorithm, where the partitioning decision is updated at regular intervals during token generation. The approach is myopic in that it is based on instantaneous information about device resource availability and network link bandwidths. When first executed, the algorithm places blocks on devices, and in later executions, it migrates these blocks among devices so that the sum of migration delay and inference delay remains low. Our approach partitions the decoder at the attention head level, co-locating each attention head with its key-value cache and allowing dynamic migrations whenever resources become tight. By allocating different attention heads to different devices, we exploit parallel execution of attention heads and thus achieve substantial reductions in inference delays. Our experiments show that in small-scale settings (3-5 devices), the proposed method achieves within 15 to 20 percent of an exact optimal solver's latency, while in larger-scale tests it achieves notable improvements in inference speed and memory usage compared to state-of-the-art layer-based partitioning approaches.

Abstract: Conventional techniques for imposing monotonicity in MLPs by construction involve the use of non-negative weight constraints and bounded activation functions, which pose well-known optimization challenges. In this work, we generalize previous theoretical results, showing that MLPs with non-negative weight constraint and activations that saturate on alternating sides are universal approximators for monotonic functions. Additionally, we show an equivalence between the saturation side in the activations and the sign of the weight constraint. This connection allows us to prove that MLPs with convex monotone activations and non-positive constrained weights also qualify as universal approximators, in contrast to their non-negative constrained counterparts. Our results provide theoretical grounding to the empirical effectiveness observed in previous works while leading to possible architectural simplification. Moreover, to further alleviate the optimization difficulties, we propose an alternative formulation that allows the network to adjust its activations according to the sign of the weights. This eliminates the requirement for weight reparameterization, easing initialization and improving training stability. Experimental evaluation reinforces the validity of the theoretical results, showing that our novel approach compares favourably to traditional monotonic architectures.

<title>Lazy But Effective: Collaborative Personalized Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Data</title>

Abstract: In Federated Learning, heterogeneity in client data distributions often means that a single global model does not have the best performance for individual clients. Consider for example training a next-word prediction model for keyboards: user-specific language patterns due to demographics (dialect, age, etc.), language proficiency, and writing style result in a highly non-IID dataset across clients. Other examples are medical images taken with different machines, or driving data from different vehicle types. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective personalized federated learning framework (pFedLIA) that utilizes a computationally efficient influence approximation, called `Lazy Influence', to cluster clients in a distributed manner before model aggregation. Within each cluster, data owners collaborate to jointly train a model that captures the specific data patterns of the clients. Our method has been shown to successfully recover the global model's performance drop due to the non-IID-ness in various synthetic and real-world settings, specifically a next-word prediction task on the Nordic languages as well as several benchmark tasks. It matches the performance of a hypothetical Oracle clustering, and significantly improves on existing baselines, e.g., an improvement of 17% on CIFAR100.

Abstract: We introduce Bielik v3, a series of parameter-efficient generative text models (1.5B and 4.5B) optimized for Polish language processing. These models demonstrate that smaller, well-optimized architectures can achieve performance comparable to much larger counterparts while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. Our approach incorporates several key innovations: a custom Polish tokenizer (APT4) that significantly improves token efficiency, Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss to balance learning across instruction types, and Adaptive Learning Rate that dynamically adjusts based on training progress. Trained on a meticulously curated corpus of 292 billion tokens spanning 303 million documents, these models excel across multiple benchmarks, including the Open PL LLM Leaderboard, Complex Polish Text Understanding Benchmark, Polish EQ-Bench, and Polish Medical Leaderboard. The 4.5B parameter model achieves results competitive with models 2-3 times its size, while the 1.5B model delivers strong performance despite its extremely compact profile. These advances establish new benchmarks for parameter-efficient language modeling in less-represented languages, making high-quality Polish language AI more accessible for resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a cornerstone in graph-based data analysis, with applications in diverse domains such as bioinformatics, social networks, and recommendation systems. However, the interplay between model interpretability and robustness remains poorly understood, especially under adversarial scenarios like poisoning and evasion attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark to systematically analyze the impact of various factors on the interpretability of GNNs, including the influence of robustness-enhancing defense mechanisms.
  We evaluate six GNN architectures based on GCN, SAGE, GIN, and GAT across five datasets from two distinct domains, employing four interpretability metrics: Fidelity, Stability, Consistency, and Sparsity. Our study examines how defenses against poisoning and evasion attacks, applied before and during model training, affect interpretability and highlights critical trade-offs between robustness and interpretability. The framework will be published as open source.
  The results reveal significant variations in interpretability depending on the chosen defense methods and model architecture characteristics. By establishing a standardized benchmark, this work provides a foundation for developing GNNs that are both robust to adversarial threats and interpretable, facilitating trust in their deployment in sensitive applications.

Abstract: Federated graph learning is a widely recognized technique that promotes collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client graphs.However, existing approaches heavily rely on the communication of model parameters or gradients for federated optimization and fail to adequately address the data heterogeneity introduced by intricate and diverse graph distributions. Although some methods attempt to share additional messages among the server and clients to improve federated convergence during communication, they introduce significant privacy risks and increase communication overhead. To address these issues, we introduce the concept of a condensed graph as a novel optimization carrier to address FGL data heterogeneity and propose a new FGL paradigm called FedGM. Specifically, we utilize a generalized condensation graph consensus to aggregate comprehensive knowledge from distributed graphs, while minimizing communication costs and privacy risks through a single transmission of the condensed data. Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedGM over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting its potential for a novel FGL paradigm.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language model (LLM) fine-tuning show promise in addressing multi-objective tasks but still face significant challenges, including complex objective balancing, low training efficiency, poor scalability, and limited explainability. Leveraging ensemble learning principles, we introduce an Ensemble Multi-Objective RL (EMORL) framework that fine-tunes multiple models with individual objectives while optimizing their aggregation after the training to improve efficiency and flexibility. Our method is the first to aggregate the last hidden states of individual models, incorporating contextual information from multiple objectives. This approach is supported by a hierarchical grid search algorithm that identifies optimal weighted combinations. We evaluate EMORL on counselor reflection generation tasks, using text-scoring LLMs to evaluate the generations and provide rewards during RL fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on the PAIR and Psych8k datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of EMORL against existing baselines: significantly lower and more stable training consumption ($17,529\pm 1,650$ data points and $6,573\pm 147.43$ seconds), improved scalability and explainability, and comparable performance across multiple objectives.

Abstract: Real-time, intelligent, and natural speech interaction is an essential part of the next-generation human-computer interaction. Recent advancements have showcased the potential of building intelligent spoken chatbots based on large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce LLaMA-Omni 2, a series of speech language models (SpeechLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 14B parameters, capable of achieving high-quality real-time speech interaction. LLaMA-Omni 2 is built upon the Qwen2.5 series models, integrating a speech encoder and an autoregressive streaming speech decoder. Despite being trained on only 200K multi-turn speech dialogue samples, LLaMA-Omni 2 demonstrates strong performance on several spoken question answering and speech instruction following benchmarks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art SpeechLMs like GLM-4-Voice, which was trained on millions of hours of speech data.

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a crucial property in artificial intelligence, enabling models to handle novel combinations of known components. While most deep learning models lack this capability, certain models succeed in specific tasks, suggesting the existence of governing conditions. This paper derives a necessary and sufficient condition for compositional generalization in neural networks. Conceptually, it requires that (i) the computational graph matches the true compositional structure, and (ii) components encode just enough information in training. The condition is supported by mathematical proofs. This criterion combines aspects of architecture design, regularization, and training data properties. A carefully designed minimal example illustrates an intuitive understanding of the condition. We also discuss the potential of the condition for assessing compositional generalization before training. This work is a fundamental theoretical study of compositional generalization in neural networks.

Abstract: Chemical reaction and retrosynthesis prediction are fundamental tasks in drug discovery. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in many domains. However, directly applying LLMs to these tasks faces two major challenges: (i) lacking a large-scale chemical synthesis-related instruction dataset; (ii) ignoring the close correlation between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction for the existing fine-tuning strategies. To address these challenges, we propose ChemDual, a novel LLM framework for accurate chemical synthesis. Specifically, considering the high cost of data acquisition for reaction and retrosynthesis, ChemDual regards the reaction-and-retrosynthesis of molecules as a related recombination-and-fragmentation process and constructs a large-scale of 4.4 million instruction dataset. Furthermore, ChemDual introduces an enhanced LLaMA, equipped with a multi-scale tokenizer and dual-task learning strategy, to jointly optimize the process of recombination and fragmentation as well as the tasks between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction. Extensive experiments on Mol-Instruction and USPTO-50K datasets demonstrate that ChemDual achieves state-of-the-art performance in both predictions of reaction and retrosynthesis, outperforming the existing conventional single-task approaches and the general open-source LLMs. Through molecular docking analysis, ChemDual generates compounds with diverse and strong protein binding affinity, further highlighting its strong potential in drug design.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) systems increasingly operate in environments where devices must respond in real time while managing fluctuating resource constraints, including energy and bandwidth. Yet, current approaches often fall short in addressing scenarios where operational constraints evolve over time. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Budgeted Multi-Armed Bandit framework tailored for IoT applications with dynamic operational limits. Our model introduces a decaying violation budget, which permits limited constraint violations early in the learning process and gradually enforces stricter compliance over time. We present the Budgeted Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, which adaptively balances performance optimization and compliance with time-varying constraints. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that Budgeted UCB achieves sublinear regret and logarithmic constraint violations over the learning horizon. Extensive simulations in a wireless communication setting show that our approach achieves faster adaptation and better constraint satisfaction than standard online learning methods. These results highlight the framework's potential for building adaptive, resource-aware IoT systems.

Abstract: Gaze may enhance the robustness of lie detectors but remains under-studied. This study evaluated the efficacy of AI models (using fixations, saccades, blinks, and pupil size) for detecting deception in Concealed Information Tests across two datasets. The first, collected with Eyelink 1000, contains gaze data from a computerized experiment where 87 participants revealed, concealed, or faked the value of a previously selected card. The second, collected with Pupil Neon, involved 36 participants performing a similar task but facing an experimenter. XGBoost achieved accuracies up to 74% in a binary classification task (Revealing vs. Concealing) and 49% in a more challenging three-classification task (Revealing vs. Concealing vs. Faking). Feature analysis identified saccade number, duration, amplitude, and maximum pupil size as the most important for deception prediction. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using gaze and AI to enhance lie detectors and encourage future research that may improve on this.

Abstract: The Transformer model has shown strong performance in multivariate time series forecasting by leveraging channel-wise self-attention. However, this approach lacks temporal constraints when computing temporal features and does not utilize cumulative historical series effectively.To address these limitations, we propose the Structured Channel-wise Transformer with Cumulative Historical state (SCFormer). SCFormer introduces temporal constraints to all linear transformations, including the query, key, and value matrices, as well as the fully connected layers within the Transformer. Additionally, SCFormer employs High-order Polynomial Projection Operators (HiPPO) to deal with cumulative historical time series, allowing the model to incorporate information beyond the look-back window during prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that SCFormer significantly outperforms mainstream baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing time series forecasting.

Abstract: Serious illness communication (SIC) in end-of-life care faces challenges such as emotional stress, cultural barriers, and balancing hope with honesty. Despite its importance, one of the few available ways for clinicians to practice SIC is with standardized patients, which is expensive, time-consuming, and inflexible. In this paper, we present SOPHIE, an AI-powered standardized patient simulation and automated feedback system. SOPHIE combines large language models (LLMs), a lifelike virtual avatar, and automated, personalized feedback based on clinical literature to provide remote, on-demand SIC training. In a randomized control study with healthcare students and professionals, SOPHIE users demonstrated significant improvement across three critical SIC domains: Empathize, Be Explicit, and Empower. These results suggest that AI-driven tools can enhance complex interpersonal communication skills, offering scalable, accessible solutions to address a critical gap in clinician education.

Abstract: Cellular reprogramming, the artificial transformation of one cell type into another, has been attracting increasing research attention due to its therapeutic potential for complex diseases. However, discovering reprogramming strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs. In this study, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory networks and signalling pathway networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under the asynchronous update mode in the context of cellular reprogramming. To facilitate scalability, we consider our previously introduced concept of a pseudo-attractor and we improve our procedure for effective identification of pseudo-attractor states. Finally, we devise a computational framework to solve the control problem. To leverage the structure of biological systems, we incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolutions into the artificial neural network approximator for the action-value function learned by the DRL agent. Experiments on a number of large real-world biological networks from literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a prominent solution for Natural Language Processing tasks. Notably, they can approach these problems in a zero or few-shot manner, thereby eliminating the need for training or fine-tuning task-specific models. However, LLMs face some challenges, including hallucination and the presence of outdated knowledge or missing information from specific domains in the training data. These problems cannot be easily solved by retraining the models with new data as it is a time-consuming and expensive process. To mitigate these issues, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been proposed as a structured external source of information to enrich LLMs. With this idea, in this work we use KGs to enhance LLMs for zero-shot Entity Disambiguation (ED). For that purpose, we leverage the hierarchical representation of the entities' classes in a KG to gradually prune the candidate space as well as the entities' descriptions to enrich the input prompt with additional factual knowledge. Our evaluation on popular ED datasets shows that the proposed method outperforms non-enhanced and description-only enhanced LLMs, and has a higher degree of adaptability than task-specific models. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis and discuss the impact of the leveraged KG's semantic expressivity on the ED performance.

Abstract: Legal practice requires careful adherence to procedural rules. In the United States, few are more complex than those found in The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation. Compliance with this system's 500+ pages of byzantine formatting instructions is the raison d'etre of thousands of student law review editors and the bete noire of lawyers everywhere. To evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) are able to adhere to the procedures of such a complicated system, we construct an original dataset of 866 Bluebook tasks and test flagship LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and DeepSeek. We show (1) that these models produce fully compliant Bluebook citations only 69%-74% of the time and (2) that in-context learning on the Bluebook's underlying system of rules raises accuracy only to 77%. These results caution against using off-the-shelf LLMs to automate aspects of the law where fidelity to procedure is paramount.

The immense scale of WSIs, often exceeding 100,000 X 100,000 pixels, clashes with the limited views traditional monitors offer. This mismatch forces constant panning and zooming, increasing pathologist cognitive load, causing diagnostic fatigue, and slowing pathologists' adoption of digital methods. PathVis, our mixed-reality visualization platform for Apple Vision Pro, addresses these challenges. It transforms the pathologist's interaction with data, replacing cumbersome mouse-and-monitor navigation with intuitive exploration using natural hand gestures, eye gaze, and voice commands in an immersive workspace. PathVis integrates AI to enhance diagnosis. An AI-driven search function instantly retrieves and displays the top five similar patient cases side-by-side, improving diagnostic precision and efficiency through rapid comparison. Additionally, a multimodal conversational AI assistant offers real-time image interpretation support and aids collaboration among pathologists across multiple Apple devices. By merging the directness of traditional pathology with advanced mixed-reality visualization and AI, PathVis improves diagnostic workflows, reduces cognitive strain, and makes pathology practice more effective and engaging.

<title>HSplitLoRA: A Heterogeneous Split Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Framework for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs, revolutionizing the natural language processing domain and beyond. Due to immense parameter sizes, fine-tuning these models with private data for diverse downstream tasks has become mainstream. Though federated learning (FL) offers a promising solution for fine-tuning LLMs without sharing raw data, substantial computing costs hinder its democratization. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, private client devices often possess heterogeneous computing resources, further complicating LLM fine-tuning. To combat these challenges, we propose HSplitLoRA, a heterogeneous parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework built on split learning (SL) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, for efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on heterogeneous client devices. HSplitLoRA first identifies important weights based on their contributions to LLM training. It then dynamically configures the decomposition ranks of LoRA adapters for selected weights and determines the model split point according to varying computing budgets of client devices. Finally, a noise-free adapter aggregation mechanism is devised to support heterogeneous adapter aggregation without introducing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HSplitLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in training accuracy and convergence speed.

<title>Towards Dataset Copyright Evasion Attack against Personalized Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have rapidly advanced, enabling high-quality image generation conditioned on textual prompts. However, the growing trend of fine-tuning pre-trained models for personalization raises serious concerns about unauthorized dataset usage. To combat this, dataset ownership verification (DOV) has emerged as a solution, embedding watermarks into the fine-tuning datasets using backdoor techniques. These watermarks remain inactive under benign samples but produce owner-specified outputs when triggered. Despite the promise of DOV for T2I diffusion models, its robustness against copyright evasion attacks (CEA) remains unexplored. In this paper, we explore how attackers can bypass these mechanisms through CEA, allowing models to circumvent watermarks even when trained on watermarked datasets. We propose the first copyright evasion attack (i.e., CEAT2I) specifically designed to undermine DOV in T2I diffusion models. Concretely, our CEAT2I comprises three stages: watermarked sample detection, trigger identification, and efficient watermark mitigation. A key insight driving our approach is that T2I models exhibit faster convergence on watermarked samples during the fine-tuning, evident through intermediate feature deviation. Leveraging this, CEAT2I can reliably detect the watermarked samples. Then, we iteratively ablate tokens from the prompts of detected watermarked samples and monitor shifts in intermediate features to pinpoint the exact trigger tokens. Finally, we adopt a closed-form concept erasure method to remove the injected watermark. Extensive experiments show that our CEAT2I effectively evades DOV mechanisms while preserving model performance.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning reaches a superhuman level of play in many complete information games. The state of the art algorithm for learning with zero knowledge is AlphaZero. We take another approach, Ath\'enan, which uses a different, Minimax-based, search algorithm called Descent, as well as different learning targets and that does not use a policy. We show that for multiple games it is much more efficient than the reimplementation of AlphaZero: Polygames. It is even competitive with Polygames when Polygames uses 100 times more GPU (at least for some games). One of the keys to the superior performance is that the cost of generating state data for training is approximately 296 times lower with Ath\'enan. With the same reasonable ressources, Ath\'enan without reinforcement heuristic is at least 7 times faster than Polygames and much more than 30 times faster with reinforcement heuristic.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and communication networks are expected to have groundbreaking synergies for 6G. Connecting GenAI agents via a wireless network can potentially unleash the power of Collective Intelligence (CI) and pave the way for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, current wireless networks are designed as a "data pipe" and are not suited to accommodate and leverage the power of GenAI. In this paper, we propose the GenAINet framework in which distributed GenAI agents communicate knowledge (facts, experiences, and methods) to accomplish arbitrary tasks. We first propose an architecture for a single GenAI agent and then provide a network architecture integrating GenAI capabilities to manage both network protocols and applications. Building on this, we investigate effective communication and reasoning problems by proposing a semantic-native GenAINet. Specifically, GenAI agents extract semantics from heterogeneous raw data, build and maintain a knowledge model representing the semantic relationships among pieces of knowledge, which is retrieved by GenAI models for planning and reasoning. Under this paradigm, different levels of collaboration can be achieved flexibly depending on the complexity of targeted tasks. Furthermore, we conduct two case studies in which, through wireless device queries, we demonstrate that extracting, compressing and transferring common knowledge can improve query accuracy while reducing communication costs; and in the wireless power control problem, we show that distributed agents can complete general tasks independently through collaborative reasoning without predefined communication protocols. Finally, we discuss challenges and future research directions in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) in 6G networks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing in healthcare, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of services across various specialties, including cardiology, ophthalmology, dermatology, emergency medicine, etc. AI applications have significantly improved diagnostic accuracy, treatment personalization, and patient outcome predictions by leveraging technologies such as machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing. However, these advancements also introduce substantial ethical and fairness challenges, particularly related to biases in data and algorithms. These biases can lead to disparities in healthcare delivery, affecting diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes across different demographic groups. This review paper examines the integration of AI in healthcare, highlighting critical challenges related to bias and exploring strategies for mitigation. We emphasize the necessity of diverse datasets, fairness-aware algorithms, and regulatory frameworks to ensure equitable healthcare delivery. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, advocating for interdisciplinary approaches, transparency in AI decision-making, and the development of innovative and inclusive AI applications.

Abstract: Connectionist approaches to machine learning, \emph{i.e.} neural networks, are enjoying a considerable vogue right now. However, these methods require large volumes of data and produce models that are uninterpretable to humans. An alternative framework that is compatible with neural networks and gradient-based learning, but explicitly models compositionality, is Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). VSAs are a family of algebras on high-dimensional vector representations. They arose in cognitive science from the need to unify neural processing and the kind of symbolic reasoning that humans perform. While machine learning methods have benefited from category-theoretical analyses, VSAs have not yet received similar treatment. In this paper, we present a first attempt at applying category theory to VSAs. Specifically, We generalise from vectors to co-presheaves, and describe VSA operations as the right Kan extensions of the external tensor product. This formalisation involves a proof that the right Kan extension in such cases can be expressed as simple, element-wise operations. We validate our formalisation with worked examples that connect to current VSA implementations, while suggesting new possible designs for VSAs.

<title>Recursive Inference Scaling: A Winning Path to Scalable Inference in Language and Multimodal Systems</title>

Abstract: Inspired by recent findings on the fractal geometry of language, we introduce Recursive INference Scaling (RINS) as a complementary, plug-in recipe for scaling inference time in language and multimodal systems. RINS is a particular form of recursive depth that significantly outperforms +55 other variants, including the recent "repeat-all-over" (RAO) strategy in Mobile LLM (Liu et al., 2024) and latent recurrent thinking (Geiping et al., 2025). Unlike prior works, we carry out our comparisons on a compute-matched regime, and demonstrate that for a fixed model size and training compute budget, RINS substantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes beyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a +2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by deriving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic performance limits and the scaling exponents. More importantly, with light-weight (linear) adapters (comprising <1% of model parameters) and stochastic dropout, RINS offers a no-regret strategy, meaning that RINS-enabled pretraining improves performance in language modeling even when recursive depth is not applied at inference time. This corresponds to improving performance on a training compute-, parameter-, and inference-matched regime, suggesting its potential as a viable component of LLM pretraining!

Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel approach for plant hierarchical taxonomy classification by posing the problem as an open class problem. It is observed that existing methods for medicinal plant classification often fail to perform hierarchical classification and accurately identifying unknown species, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensive plant taxonomy classification. Thus we address the problem of unknown species classification by assigning it best hierarchical labels. We propose a novel method, which integrates DenseNet121, Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA) and cascaded classifiers for hierarchical classification. The approach systematically categorizes medicinal plants at multiple taxonomic levels, from phylum to species, ensuring detailed and precise classification. Using multi scale space attention, the model captures both local and global contextual information from the images, improving the distinction between similar species and the identification of new ones. It uses attention scores to focus on important features across multiple scales. The proposed method provides a solution for hierarchical classification, showcasing superior performance in identifying both known and unknown species. The model was tested on two state-of-art datasets with and without background artifacts and so that it can be deployed to tackle real word application. We used unknown species for testing our model. For unknown species the model achieved an average accuracy of 83.36%, 78.30%, 60.34% and 43.32% for predicting correct phylum, class, order and family respectively. Our proposed model size is almost four times less than the existing state of the art methods making it easily deploy able in real world application.

Abstract: The exponential growth of unstructured text data presents a fundamental challenge in modern data management and information retrieval. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, their potential to transform unstructured text into standardized, structured formats remains largely unexplored - a capability that could revolutionize data processing workflows across industries. This study breaks new ground by systematically evaluating LLMs' ability to convert unstructured recipe text into the structured Cooklang format. Through comprehensive testing of four models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama3.1:70b, and Llama3.1:8b), an innovative evaluation approach is introduced that combines traditional metrics (WER, ROUGE-L, TER) with specialized metrics for semantic element identification. Our experiments reveal that GPT-4o with few-shot prompting achieves breakthrough performance (ROUGE-L: 0.9722, WER: 0.0730), demonstrating for the first time that LLMs can reliably transform domain-specific unstructured text into structured formats without extensive training. Although model performance generally scales with size, we uncover surprising potential in smaller models like Llama3.1:8b for optimization through targeted fine-tuning. These findings open new possibilities for automated structured data generation across various domains, from medical records to technical documentation, potentially transforming the way organizations process and utilize unstructured information.

Abstract: The study of representation universality in AI models reveals growing convergence across domains, modalities, and architectures. However, the practical applications of representation universality remain largely unexplored. We bridge this gap by demonstrating that safety interventions can be transferred between models through learned mappings of their shared activation spaces. We demonstrate this approach on two well-established AI safety tasks: backdoor removal and refusal of harmful prompts, showing successful transfer of steering vectors that alter the models' outputs in a predictable way. Additionally, we propose a new task, \textit{corrupted capabilities}, where models are fine-tuned to embed knowledge tied to a backdoor. This tests their ability to separate useful skills from backdoors, reflecting real-world challenges. Extensive experiments across Llama, Qwen and Gemma model families show that our method enables using smaller models to efficiently align larger ones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that autoencoder mappings between base and fine-tuned models can serve as reliable ``lightweight safety switches", allowing dynamic toggling between model behaviors.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to discuss the potential of using methods from Reinforcement Learning for Life Cycle Assessment in a circular economy, and to present some new ideas in this direction. To give some context, we explain how Reinforcement Learning was successfully applied in computer chess (and beyond). As computer chess was historically called the "drosophila of AI", we start by describing a method for the board representation called 'rotated bitboards' that can potentially also be applied in the context of sustainability. In the first part of this paper, the concepts of the bitboard-representation and the advantages of (rotated) bitboards in move generation are explained. In order to illustrate those ideas practice, the concrete implementation of the move-generator in FUSc# (a chess engine developed at FU Berlin in C# some years ago) is described. In addition, rotated binary neural networks are discussed briefly.
  The second part deals with reinforcement learning in computer chess (and beyond). We exemplify the progress that has been made in this field in the last 15-20 years by comparing the "state of the art" from 2002-2008, when FUSc# was developed, with the ground-breaking innovations connected to "AlphaZero". We review some application of the ideas developed in AlphaZero in other domains, e.g. the "other Alphas" like AlphaFold, AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry and AlphaProof. In the final part of the paper, we discuss the computer-science related challenges that changing the economic paradigm towards (absolute) sustainability poses and in how far what we call 'progressive computer science' needs to contribute. Concrete challenges include the closing of material loops in a circular economy with Life Cycle Assessment in order to optimize for (absolute) sustainability, and we present some new ideas in this direction.

Abstract: There is a recent growing interest in applying Deep Learning techniques to tabular data, in order to replicate the success of other Artificial Intelligence areas in this structured domain. Specifically interesting is the case in which tabular data have a time dependence, such as, for instance financial transactions. However, the heterogeneity of the tabular values, in which categorical elements are mixed with numerical items, makes this adaptation difficult. In this paper we propose a Transformer architecture to represent heterogeneous time-dependent tabular data, in which numerical features are represented using a set of frequency functions and the whole network is uniformly trained with a unique loss function.

Abstract: Transformers are a neural network architecture originally developed for natural language processing, which have since become a foundational tool for solving a wide range of problems, including text, audio, image processing, reinforcement learning, and other tasks involving heterogeneous input data. Their hallmark is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh different parts of the input sequence dynamically, and is an evolution of earlier attention-based approaches. This article provides readers with the necessary background to understand recent research on transformer models, and presents the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of their core components. It also explores the architecture's various elements, potential modifications, and some of the most relevant applications. The article is written in Spanish to help make this scientific knowledge more accessible to the Spanish-speaking community.

Abstract: The intersection of Foundation Model (FM) and Federated Learning (FL) presents a unique opportunity to unlock new possibilities for real-world applications. On the one hand, FL, as a collaborative learning paradigm, help address challenges in FM development by expanding data availability, enabling computation sharing, facilitating the collaborative development of FMs, tackling continuous data update, avoiding FM monopoly, response delay and FM service down. On the other hand, FM, equipped with pre-trained knowledge and exceptional performance, can serve as a robust starting point for FL. It can also generate synthetic data to enrich data diversity and enhance overall performance of FL. Meanwhile, FM unlocks new sharing paradigm and multi-task and multi-modality capabilities for FL. By examining the interplay between FL and FM, this paper presents the motivations, challenges, and future directions of empowering FL with FM and empowering FM with FL. We hope that this work provides a good foundation to inspire future research efforts to drive advancements in both fields.

Abstract: This paper explores the potential impacts of large language models (LLMs) on the Chinese labor market. We analyze occupational exposure to LLM capabilities by incorporating human expertise and LLM classifications, following the methodology of Eloundou et al. (2023). The results indicate a positive correlation between occupational exposure and both wage levels and experience premiums at the occupation level. This suggests that higher-paying and experience-intensive jobs may face greater exposure risks from LLM-powered software. We then aggregate occupational exposure at the industry level to obtain industrial exposure scores. Both occupational and industrial exposure scores align with expert assessments. Our empirical analysis also demonstrates a distinct impact of LLMs, which deviates from the routinization hypothesis. We present a stylized theoretical framework to better understand this deviation from previous digital technologies. By incorporating entropy-based information theory into the task-based framework, we propose an AI learning theory that reveals a different pattern of LLM impacts compared to the routinization hypothesis.

Abstract: The agility of animals, particularly in complex activities such as running, turning, jumping, and backflipping, stands as an exemplar for robotic system design. Transferring this suite of behaviors to legged robotic systems introduces essential inquiries: How can a robot learn multiple locomotion behaviors simultaneously? How can the robot execute these tasks with a smooth transition? How to integrate these skills for wide-range applications? This paper introduces the Versatile Instructable Motion prior (VIM) - a Reinforcement Learning framework designed to incorporate a range of agile locomotion tasks suitable for advanced robotic applications. Our framework enables legged robots to learn diverse agile low-level skills by imitating animal motions and manually designed motions. Our Functionality reward guides the robot's ability to adopt varied skills, and our Stylization reward ensures that robot motions align with reference motions. Our evaluations of the VIM framework span both simulation and the real world. Our framework allows a robot to concurrently learn diverse agile locomotion skills using a single learning-based controller in the real world.

Abstract: Sharpness, a geometric measure in the parameter space that reflects the flatness of the loss landscape, has long been studied for its potential connections to neural network behavior. While sharpness is often associated with generalization, recent work highlights inconsistencies in this relationship, leaving its true significance unclear. In this paper, we investigate how sharpness influences the local geometric features of neural representations in feature space, offering a new perspective on its role. We introduce this problem and study three measures for compression: the Local Volumetric Ratio (LVR), based on volume compression, the Maximum Local Sensitivity (MLS), based on sensitivity to input changes, and the Local Dimensionality, based on how uniform the sensitivity is on different directions. We show that LVR and MLS correlate with the flatness of the loss around the local minima; and that this correlation is predicted by a relatively simple mathematical relationship: a flatter loss corresponds to a lower upper bound on the compression metrics of neural representations. Our work builds upon the linear stability insight by Ma and Ying, deriving inequalities between various compression metrics and quantities involving sharpness. Our inequalities readily extend to reparametrization-invariant sharpness as well. Through empirical experiments on various feedforward, convolutional, and transformer architectures, we find that our inequalities predict a consistently positive correlation between local representation compression and sharpness.

Abstract: The capability of generalization is a cornerstone for the success of modern learning systems. For non-Euclidean data, e.g., graphs, that particularly involves topological structures, one important aspect neglected by prior studies is how machine learning models generalize under topological shifts. This paper proposes AdvDIFFormer, a physics-inspired graph Transformer model designed to address this challenge. The model is derived from advective diffusion equations which describe a class of continuous message passing process with observed and latent topological structures. We show that AdvDIFFormer has provable capability for controlling generalization error with topological shifts, which in contrast cannot be guaranteed by graph diffusion models. Empirically, the model demonstrates superiority in various predictive tasks across information networks, molecular screening and protein interactions.

Abstract: Clustering of time series is a well-studied problem, with applications ranging from quantitative, personalized models of metabolism obtained from metabolite concentrations to state discrimination in quantum information theory. We consider a variant, where given a set of trajectories and a number of parts, we jointly partition the set of trajectories and learn linear dynamical system (LDS) models for each part, so as to minimize the maximum error across all the models. We present globally convergent methods and EM heuristics, accompanied by promising computational results. The key highlight of this method is that it does not require a predefined hidden state dimension but instead provides an upper bound. Additionally, it offers guidance for determining regularization in the system identification.

Abstract: We introduce SMUTF (Schema Matching Using Generative Tags and Hybrid Features), a unique approach for large-scale tabular data schema matching (SM), which assumes that supervised learning does not affect performance in open-domain tasks, thereby enabling effective cross-domain matching. This system uniquely combines rule-based feature engineering, pre-trained language models, and generative large language models. In an innovative adaptation inspired by the Humanitarian Exchange Language, we deploy "generative tags" for each data column, enhancing the effectiveness of SM. SMUTF exhibits extensive versatility, working seamlessly with any pre-existing pre-trained embeddings, classification methods, and generative models.
  Recognizing the lack of extensive, publicly available datasets for SM, we have created and open-sourced the HDXSM dataset from the public humanitarian data. We believe this to be the most exhaustive SM dataset currently available. In evaluations across various public datasets and the novel HDXSM dataset, SMUTF demonstrated exceptional performance, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and improving the F1 score by 11.84% and the AUC of ROC by 5.08%.

Abstract: To defend against privacy leakage of user data, differential privacy is widely used in federated learning, but it is not free. The addition of noise randomly disrupts the semantic integrity of the model and this disturbance accumulates with increased communication rounds. In this paper, we introduce a novel federated learning framework with rigorous privacy guarantees, named FedCEO, designed to strike a trade-off between model utility and user privacy by letting clients ''Collaborate with Each Other''. Specifically, we perform efficient tensor low-rank proximal optimization on stacked local model parameters at the server, demonstrating its capability to flexibly truncate high-frequency components in spectral space. This capability implies that our FedCEO can effectively recover the disrupted semantic information by smoothing the global semantic space for different privacy settings and continuous training processes. Moreover, we improve the SOTA utility-privacy trade-off bound by order of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the input dimension. We illustrate our theoretical results with experiments on representative datasets and observe significant performance improvements and strict privacy guarantees under different privacy settings. The code is available at https://github.com/6lyc/FedCEO_Collaborate-with-Each-Other.

Abstract: Existing models encounter bottlenecks in balancing performance and computational efficiency when modeling long sequences. Although the state space model (SSM) has achieved remarkable success in handling long sequence tasks, it still faces the problem of large number of parameters. In order to further improve the efficiency of SSM, we propose a new state space layer based on multiple-input multiple-output SSM, called efficient SSM (eSSM). Our eSSM is built on the convolutional representation of multi-input and multi-input (MIMO) SSM. We propose a variety of effective strategies to improve the computational efficiency. The diagonalization of the system matrix first decouples the original system. Then a fast tensor convolution is proposed based on the fast Fourier transform. In addition, the block diagonalization of the SSM further reduces the model parameters and improves the model flexibility. Extensive experimental results show that the performance of the proposed model on multiple databases matches the performance of state-of-the-art models, such as S4, and is significantly better than Transformers and LSTM. In the model efficiency benchmark, the parameters of eSSM are only 12.89\% of LSTM and 13.24\% of Mamba. The training speed of eSSM is 3.94 times faster than LSTM and 1.35 times faster than Mamba.

<title>REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories</title>

Abstract: Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.5\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.

<title>DECIDER: A Dual-System Rule-Controllable Decoding Framework for Language Generation</title>

Abstract: Constrained decoding approaches aim to control the meaning or style of text generated by the pre-trained large language models (LLMs or also PLMs) for various tasks at inference time. However, these methods often guide plausible continuations by greedily and explicitly selecting targets. Though fulfilling the task requirements, these methods may overlook certain general and natural logics that humans would implicitly follow towards such targets. Inspired by cognitive dual-process theory, in this work, we propose a novel decoding framework DECIDER where the base LLMs are equipped with a First-Order Logic (FOL) reasoner to express and evaluate the rules, along with a decision function that merges the outputs of both systems to guide the generation. Unlike previous constrained decodings, DECIDER transforms the encouragement of target-specific words into all words that satisfy several high-level rules, enabling us to programmatically integrate our logic into LLMs. Experiments on CommonGen and PersonaChat demonstrate that DECIDER effectively follows given FOL rules to guide LLMs in a more human-like and logic-controlled manner.

<title>Impact of Noisy Supervision in Foundation Model Learning</title>

Abstract: Foundation models are usually pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then adapted to downstream tasks through tuning. However, the large-scale pre-training datasets, often inaccessible or too expensive to handle, can contain label noise that may adversely affect the generalization of the model and pose unexpected risks. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively understand and analyze the nature of noise in pre-training datasets and then effectively mitigate its impacts on downstream tasks. Specifically, through extensive experiments of fully-supervised and image-text contrastive pre-training on synthetic noisy ImageNet-1K, YFCC15M, and CC12M datasets, we demonstrate that, while slight noise in pre-training can benefit in-domain (ID) performance, where the training and testing data share a similar distribution, it always deteriorates out-of-domain (OOD) performance, where training and testing distributions are significantly different. These observations are agnostic to scales of pre-training datasets, pre-training noise types, model architectures, pre-training objectives, downstream tuning methods, and downstream applications. We empirically ascertain that the reason behind this is that the pre-training noise shapes the feature space differently. We then propose a tuning method (NMTune) to affine the feature space to mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization, which is applicable in both parameter-efficient and black-box tuning manners. We additionally conduct extensive experiments on popular vision and language models, including APIs, which are supervised and self-supervised pre-trained on realistic noisy data for evaluation. Our analysis and results demonstrate the importance of this novel and fundamental research direction, which we term as Noisy Model Learning.

Abstract: How physical networks of neurons, bound by spatio-temporal locality constraints, can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.

Abstract: We propose CHOSEN, a simple yet flexible, robust and effective multi-view depth refinement framework. It can be employed in any existing multi-view stereo pipeline, with straightforward generalization capability for different multi-view capture systems such as camera relative positioning and lenses. Given an initial depth estimation, CHOSEN iteratively re-samples and selects the best hypotheses, and automatically adapts to different metric or intrinsic scales determined by the capture system. The key to our approach is the application of contrastive learning in an appropriate solution space and a carefully designed hypothesis feature, based on which positive and negative hypotheses can be effectively distinguished. Integrated in a simple baseline multi-view stereo pipeline, CHOSEN delivers impressive quality in terms of depth and normal accuracy compared to many current deep learning based multi-view stereo pipelines.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly large language models (LLMs), in finance has garnered increasing academic attention. Despite progress, existing studies predominantly focus on tasks like financial text summarization, question-answering, and stock movement prediction (binary classification), the application of LLMs to financial risk prediction remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, in this paper, we introduce RiskLabs, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze and predict financial risks. RiskLabs uniquely integrates multimodal financial data, including textual and vocal information from Earnings Conference Calls (ECCs), market-related time series data, and contextual news data to improve financial risk prediction. Empirical results demonstrate RiskLabs' effectiveness in forecasting both market volatility and variance. Through comparative experiments, we examine the contributions of different data sources to financial risk assessment and highlight the crucial role of LLMs in this process. We also discuss the challenges associated with using LLMs for financial risk prediction and explore the potential of combining them with multimodal data for this purpose.

Abstract: A core data-centric learning challenge is the identification of training samples that are detrimental to model performance. Influence functions serve as a prominent tool for this task and offer a robust framework for assessing training data influence on model predictions. Despite their widespread use, their high computational cost associated with calculating the inverse of the Hessian matrix pose constraints, particularly when analyzing large-sized deep models. In this paper, we establish a bridge between identifying detrimental training samples via influence functions and outlier gradient detection. This transformation not only presents a straightforward and Hessian-free formulation but also provides insights into the role of the gradient in sample impact. Through systematic empirical evaluations, we first validate the hypothesis of our proposed outlier gradient analysis approach on synthetic datasets. We then demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting mislabeled samples in vision models and selecting data samples for improving performance of natural language processing transformer models. We also extend its use to influential sample identification for fine-tuning Large Language Models.

<title>From Human Judgements to Predictive Models: Unravelling Acceptability in Code-Mixed Sentences</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05572</link>

Abstract: Current computational approaches for analysing or generating code-mixed sentences do not explicitly model ``naturalness'' or ``acceptability'' of code-mixed sentences, but rely on training corpora to reflect distribution of acceptable code-mixed sentences. Modelling human judgement for the acceptability of code-mixed text can help in distinguishing natural code-mixed text and enable quality-controlled generation of code-mixed text. To this end, we construct Cline - a dataset containing human acceptability judgements for English-Hindi~(en-hi) code-mixed text. Cline is the largest of its kind with 16,642 sentences, consisting of samples sourced from two sources: synthetically generated code-mixed text and samples collected from online social media. Our analysis establishes that popular code-mixing metrics such as CMI, Number of Switch Points, Burstines, which are used to filter/curate/compare code-mixed corpora have low correlation with human acceptability judgements, underlining the necessity of our dataset. Experiments using Cline demonstrate that simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models when trained solely using code-mixing metrics as features are outperformed by fine-tuned pre-trained Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, among Encoder models XLM-Roberta and Bernice outperform IndicBERT across different configurations. Among Encoder-Decoder models, mBART performs better than mT5, however Encoder-Decoder models are not able to outperform Encoder-only models. Decoder-only models perform the best when compared to all other MLLMS, with Llama 3.2 - 3B models outperforming similarly sized Qwen, Phi models. Comparison with zero and fewshot capabilitites of ChatGPT show that MLLMs fine-tuned on larger data outperform ChatGPT, providing scope for improvement in code-mixed tasks. Zero-shot transfer from En-Hi to En-Te acceptability judgments are better than random baselines.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a series of techniques that generate high-quality artificial data by manipulating existing data samples. By leveraging data augmentation techniques, AI models can achieve significantly improved applicability in tasks involving scarce or imbalanced datasets, thereby substantially enhancing AI models' generalization capabilities. Existing literature surveys only focus on a certain type of specific modality data, and categorize these methods from modality-specific and operation-centric perspectives, which lacks a consistent summary of data augmentation methods across multiple modalities and limits the comprehension of how existing data samples serve the data augmentation process. To bridge this gap, we propose a more enlightening taxonomy that encompasses data augmentation techniques for different common data modalities. Specifically, from a data-centric perspective, this survey proposes a modality-independent taxonomy by investigating how to take advantage of the intrinsic relationship between data samples, including single-wise, pair-wise, and population-wise sample data augmentation methods. Additionally, we categorize data augmentation methods across five data modalities through a unified inductive approach.

Abstract: In machine learning practice it is often useful to identify relevant input features, so as to obtain compact dataset for more efficient numerical handling. On the other hand, by isolating key input elements, ranked according their respective degree of relevance, can help to elaborate on the process of decision making. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate the relative importance of the input components for a Deep Neural Network. This is achieved by leveraging on a spectral re-parametrization of the optimization process. Eigenvalues associated to input nodes provide in fact a robust proxy to gauge the relevance of the supplied entry features. Notably, the spectral features ranking is performed automatically, as a byproduct of the network training, with no additional processing to be carried out. The technique is successfully challenged against both synthetic and real data.

arXiv:2406.08918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In differentially private (DP) machine learning, the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms are often reported and compared on the basis of a single $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-pair. This practice overlooks that DP guarantees can vary substantially even between mechanisms sharing a given $(\varepsilon, \delta)$, and potentially introduces privacy vulnerabilities which can remain undetected. This motivates the need for robust, rigorous methods for comparing DP guarantees in such cases. Here, we introduce the $\Delta$-divergence between mechanisms which quantifies the worst-case excess privacy vulnerability of choosing one mechanism over another in terms of $(\varepsilon, \delta)$, $f$-DP and in terms of a newly presented Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, as a generalisation of the Blackwell theorem, it is endowed with strong decision-theoretic foundations. Through application examples, we show that our techniques can facilitate informed decision-making and reveal gaps in the current understanding of privacy risks, as current practices in DP-SGD often result in choosing mechanisms with high excess privacy vulnerabilities.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of providing a novel approach to sourcing significant training data for LLMs focused on science and engineering. In particular, a crucial challenge is sourcing parallel scientific codes in the ranges of millions to billions of codes. To tackle this problem, we propose an automated pipeline framework called LASSI, designed to translate between parallel programming languages by bootstrapping existing closed- or open-source LLMs. LASSI incorporates autonomous enhancement through self-correcting loops where errors encountered during the compilation and execution of generated code are fed back to the LLM through guided prompting for debugging and refactoring. We highlight the bi-directional translation of existing GPU benchmarks between OpenMP target offload and CUDA to validate LASSI. The results of evaluating LASSI with different application codes across four LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of LASSI for generating executable parallel codes, with 80% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 85% of CUDA to OpenMP translations producing the expected output. We also observe approximately 78% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 62% of CUDA to OpenMP translations execute within 10% of or at a faster runtime than the original benchmark code in the same language.

Abstract: Distributed deep learning in resource-constrained environments faces scalability and generalization challenges due to large effective batch sizes and non-identically distributed client data. We introduce a server-driven sampling strategy that maintains a fixed global batch size by dynamically adjusting client-side batch sizes. This decouples the effective batch size from the number of participating devices and ensures that global batches better reflect the overall data distribution. Using standard concentration bounds, we establish tighter deviation guarantees compared to existing approaches. Empirical results on a benchmark dataset confirm that the proposed method improves model accuracy, training efficiency, and convergence stability, offering a scalable solution for learning at the network edge.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language processing tasks, they still struggle with generating logically sound arguments, resulting in potential risks such as spreading misinformation. To address this issue, we introduce FIPO, a fallacy-informed framework that leverages preference optimization methods to steer LLMs toward logically sound arguments. FIPO includes a classification loss, to capture the fine-grained information on fallacy types. Our results on argumentation datasets show that our method reduces the fallacy errors by up to 17.5%. Furthermore, our human evaluation results indicate that the quality of the generated arguments by our method significantly outperforms the fine-tuned baselines, as well as other preference optimization methods, such as DPO. These findings highlight the importance of ensuring models are aware of logical fallacies for effective argument generation. Our code is available at github.com/lucamouchel/Logical-Fallacies.

Abstract: Molecular optimization is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, aimed at refining molecular structures to enhance drug efficacy and minimize side effects, ultimately accelerating the overall drug development process. Many target-based molecular optimization methods have been proposed, significantly advancing drug discovery. These methods primarily on understanding the specific drug target structures or their hypothesized roles in combating diseases. However, challenges such as a limited number of available targets and a difficulty capturing clear structures hinder innovative drug development. In contrast, phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) does not depend on clear target structures and can identify hits with novel and unbiased polypharmacology signatures. As a result, PDD-based molecular optimization can reduce potential safety risks while optimizing phenotypic activity, thereby increasing the likelihood of clinical success. Therefore, we propose a fragment-masked molecular optimization method based on PDD (FMOP). FMOP employs a regression-free diffusion model to conditionally optimize the molecular masked regions without training, effectively generating new molecules with similar scaffolds. On the large-scale drug response dataset GDSCv2, we optimize the potential molecules across all 945 cell lines. The overall experiments demonstrate that the in-silico optimization success rate reaches 94.4%, with an average efficacy increase of 5.3%. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation and visualization experiments, confirming that FMOP is an effective and robust molecular optimization method. The code is available at:https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FMOP-98C2.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling diverse modalities and tasks, outperforming conventional artificial intelligence (AI) approaches that are highly task-specific and modality-reliant. In the medical domain, however, the development of comprehensive foundation models is constrained by limited access to diverse modalities and stringent privacy regulations. To address these constraints, this study introduces a novel knowledge injection approach, FedKIM, designed to scale the medical foundation model within a federated learning framework. FedKIM leverages lightweight local models to extract healthcare knowledge from private data and integrates this knowledge into a centralized foundation model using a designed adaptive Multitask Multimodal Mixture Of Experts (M3OE) module. This method not only preserves privacy but also enhances the model's ability to handle complex medical tasks involving multiple modalities. Our extensive experiments across twelve tasks in seven modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKIM in various settings, highlighting its potential to scale medical foundation models without direct access to sensitive data.

Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm that enables decentralized clients to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping all the training data local. While considerable research has focused on federated image generation, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders have received less attention. In this paper, we address the challenges of non-IID (independently and identically distributed) data environments featuring multiple groups of images of different types. Non-IID data distributions can lead to difficulties in maintaining a consistent latent space and can also result in local generators with disparate texture features being blended during aggregation. We thereby introduce FissionVAE that decouples the latent space and constructs decoder branches tailored to individual client groups. This method allows for customized learning that aligns with the unique data distributions of each group. Additionally, we incorporate hierarchical VAEs and demonstrate the use of heterogeneous decoder architectures within FissionVAE. We also explore strategies for setting the latent prior distributions to enhance the decoupling process. To evaluate our approach, we assemble two composite datasets: the first combines MNIST and FashionMNIST; the second comprises RGB datasets of cartoon and human faces, wild animals, marine vessels, and remote sensing images. Our experiments demonstrate that FissionVAE greatly improves generation quality on these datasets compared to baseline federated VAE models.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various fields, from natural language processing to sectors like medicine and finance. However, despite their rapid proliferation, the applications of LLMs in telecommunications remain limited, often relying on general-purpose models that lack domain-specific specialization. This lack of specialization results in underperformance, particularly when dealing with telecommunications-specific technical terminology and their associated mathematical representations. This paper addresses this gap by first creating and disseminating Tele-Data, a comprehensive dataset of telecommunications material curated from relevant sources, and Tele-Eval, a large-scale question-and-answer dataset tailored to the domain. Through extensive experiments, we explore the most effective training techniques for adapting LLMs to the telecommunications domain, ranging from examining the division of expertise across various telecommunications aspects to employing parameter-efficient techniques. We also investigate how models of different sizes behave during adaptation and analyze the impact of their training data on this behavior. Leveraging these findings, we develop and open-source Tele-LLMs, the first series of language models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, specifically tailored for telecommunications. Our evaluations demonstrate that these models outperform their general-purpose counterparts on Tele-Eval and telecommunications-related literature tasks while retaining their previously acquired capabilities, thus avoiding the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon.

<title>M3-Jepa: Multimodal Alignment via Multi-directional MoE based on the JEPA framework</title>

Abstract: Current multimodal alignment strategies primarily use single or unified modality encoders, while optimizing the alignment on the original token space. Such a framework is easy to implement and incorporate with the pretrained knowledge, but might result in information bias. To deal with such issues, the joint encoding predictive architecture (JEPA) learns the alignment loss on the latent space, with a predictor to convert the input encoding to the output latent space. However, the application of JEPA in multimodal scenarios is limited so far. In this paper, we introduce M3-Jepa, a scalable multimodal alignment framework, with the predictor implemented by a multi-directional mixture of experts (MoE). We demonstrate the framework can maximize the mutual information with information theory derivations, by alternating the optimization between different uni-directional tasks. By thoroughly designed experiments, we show that M3-Jepa can obtain state-of-the-art performance on different modalities and tasks, generalize to unseen datasets and domains, and is computationally efficient in training and inference. Our study indicates that M3-Jepa might provide a new paradigm to self-supervised learning and open-world modeling.

<title>Constructive Approach to Bidirectional Influence between Qualia Structure and Language Emergence</title>

Abstract: This perspective paper explores the bidirectional influence between language emergence and the relational structure of subjective experiences, termed qualia structure, and lays out a constructive approach to the intricate dependency between the two. We hypothesize that the emergence of languages with distributional semantics (e.g., syntactic-semantic structures) is linked to the coordination of internal representations shaped by experience, potentially facilitating more structured language through reciprocal influence. This hypothesized mutual dependency connects to recent advancements in AI and symbol emergence robotics, and is explored within this paper through theoretical frameworks such as the collective predictive coding. Computational studies show that neural network-based language models form systematically structured internal representations, and multimodal language models can share representations between language and perceptual information. This perspective suggests that language emergence serves not only as a mechanism creating a communication tool but also as a mechanism for allowing people to realize shared understanding of qualitative experiences. The paper discusses the implications of this bidirectional influence in the context of consciousness studies, linguistics, and cognitive science, and outlines future constructive research directions to further explore this dynamic relationship between language emergence and qualia structure.

Abstract: In various applications, the multivariate time series often suffers from missing data. This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/

<title>Hard-Constrained Neural Networks with Universal Approximation Guarantees</title>

Abstract: Incorporating prior knowledge or specifications of input-output relationships into machine learning models has gained significant attention, as it enhances generalization from limited data and leads to conforming outputs. However, most existing approaches use soft constraints by penalizing violations through regularization, which offers no guarantee of constraint satisfaction--an essential requirement in safety-critical applications. On the other hand, imposing hard constraints on neural networks may hinder their representational power, adversely affecting performance. To address this, we propose HardNet, a practical framework for constructing neural networks that inherently satisfy hard constraints without sacrificing model capacity. Unlike approaches that modify outputs only at inference time, HardNet enables end-to-end training with hard constraint guarantees, leading to improved performance. To the best of our knowledge, HardNet is the first method with an efficient forward pass to enforce more than one input-dependent inequality constraint. It allows unconstrained optimization of the network parameters using standard algorithms by appending a differentiable closed-form enforcement layer to the network's output. Furthermore, we show that HardNet retains the universal approximation capabilities of neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of HardNet across various applications: learning with piecewise constraints, learning optimization solvers, optimizing control policies in safety-critical systems, and learning safe decision logic for aircraft systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become integral to large language models (LLMs), particularly for conversational AI systems where user questions may reference knowledge beyond the LLMs' training cutoff. However, many natural user questions lack well-defined answers, either due to limited domain knowledge or because the retrieval system returns documents that are relevant in appearance but uninformative in content. In such cases, LLMs often produce hallucinated answers without flagging them. While recent work has largely focused on questions with false premises, we study out-of-scope questions, where the retrieved document appears semantically similar to the question but lacks the necessary information to answer it. In this paper, we propose a guided hallucination-based approach ELOQ to automatically generate a diverse set of out-of-scope questions from post-cutoff documents, followed by human verification to ensure quality. We use this dataset to evaluate several LLMs on their ability to detect out-of-scope questions and generate appropriate responses. Finally, we introduce an improved detection method that enhances the reliability of LLM-based question-answering systems in handling out-of-scope questions.

Abstract: Few-Shot Open-Set Recognition (FSOSR) targets a critical real-world challenge, aiming to categorize inputs into known categories, termed closed-set classes, while identifying open-set inputs that fall outside these classes. Although transfer learning where a model is tuned to a given few-shot task has become a prominent paradigm in closed-world, we observe that it fails to expand to open-world. To unlock this challenge, we propose a two-stage method which consists of open-set aware meta-learning with open-set free transfer learning. In the open-set aware meta-learning stage, a model is trained to establish a metric space that serves as a beneficial starting point for the subsequent stage. During the open-set free transfer learning stage, the model is further adapted to a specific target task through transfer learning. Additionally, we introduce a strategy to simulate open-set examples by modifying the training dataset or generating pseudo open-set examples. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely recognized benchmarks, miniImageNet and tieredImageNet, with only a 1.5\% increase in training effort. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in FSOSR.

<title>Large Language Model with Region-guided Referring and Grounding for CT Report Generation</title>

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) report generation is crucial to assist radiologists in interpreting CT volumes, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Existing methods primarily only consider the global features of the entire volume, making it struggle to focus on specific regions and potentially missing abnormalities. To address this issue, we propose Reg2RG, the first region-guided referring and grounding framework for CT report generation, which enhances diagnostic performance by focusing on anatomical regions within the volume. Specifically, we utilize masks from a universal segmentation module to capture local features for each referring region. A local feature decoupling (LFD) strategy is proposed to preserve the local high-resolution details with little computational overhead. Then the local features are integrated with global features to capture inter-regional relationships within a cohesive context. Moreover, we propose a novel region-report alignment (RRA) training strategy. It leverages the recognition of referring regions to guide the generation of region-specific reports, enhancing the model's referring and grounding capabilities while also improving the report's interpretability. A large language model (LLM) is further employed as the language decoder to generate reports from integrated visual features, facilitating region-level comprehension. Extensive experiments on two large-scale chest CT-report datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, which outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of both natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics while preserving promising interpretability. The code is available at https://github.com/zhi-xuan-chen/Reg2RG.

Abstract: Achieving precise alignment between textual instructions and generated images in text-to-image generation is a significant challenge, particularly in rendering written text within images. Sate-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3), Flux, and AuraFlow still struggle with accurate text depiction, resulting in misspelled or inconsistent text. We introduce a training-free method with minimal computational overhead that significantly enhances text rendering quality. Specifically, we introduce an overshooting sampler for pretrained rectified flow (RF) models, by alternating between over-simulating the learned ordinary differential equation (ODE) and reintroducing noise. Compared to the Euler sampler, the overshooting sampler effectively introduces an extra Langevin dynamics term that can help correct the compounding error from successive Euler steps and therefore improve the text rendering. However, when the overshooting strength is high, we observe over-smoothing artifacts on the generated images. To address this issue, we propose an Attention Modulated Overshooting sampler (AMO), which adaptively controls the strength of overshooting for each image patch according to their attention score with the text content. AMO demonstrates a 32.3% and 35.9% improvement in text rendering accuracy on SD3 and Flux without compromising overall image quality or increasing inference cost.

Abstract: We present LiDAR-EDIT, a novel paradigm for generating synthetic LiDAR data for autonomous driving. Our framework edits real-world LiDAR scans by introducing new object layouts while preserving the realism of the background environment. Compared to end-to-end frameworks that generate LiDAR point clouds from scratch, LiDAR-EDIT offers users full control over the object layout, including the number, type, and pose of objects, while keeping most of the original real-world background. Our method also provides object labels for the generated data. Compared to novel view synthesis techniques, our framework allows for the creation of counterfactual scenarios with object layouts significantly different from the original real-world scene. LiDAR-EDIT uses spherical voxelization to enforce correct LiDAR projective geometry in the generated point clouds by construction. During object removal and insertion, generative models are employed to fill the unseen background and object parts that were occluded in the original real LiDAR scans. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework produces realistic LiDAR scans with practical value for downstream tasks.

Abstract: This study introduces PINN4PF, an end-to-end deep learning architecture for power flow (PF) analysis that effectively captures the nonlinear dynamics of large-scale modern power systems. The proposed neural network (NN) architecture consists of two important advancements in the training pipeline: (A) a double-head feed-forward NN that aligns with PF analysis, including an activation function that adjusts to the net active and reactive power injections patterns, and (B) a physics-based loss function that partially incorporates power system topology information. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated through 4-bus, 15-bus, 290-bus, and 2224-bus test systems and is evaluated against two baselines: a linear regression model (LR) and a black-box NN (MLP). The comparison is based on (i) generalization ability, (ii) robustness, (iii) impact of training dataset size on generalization ability, (iv) accuracy in approximating derived PF quantities (specifically line current, line active power, and line reactive power), and (v) scalability. Results demonstrate that PINN4PF outperforms both baselines across all test systems by up to two orders of magnitude not only in terms of direct criteria, e.g., generalization ability, but also in terms of approximating derived physical quantities.

Abstract: Large language models with retrieval-augmented generation encounter a pivotal challenge in intricate retrieval tasks, e.g., multi-hop question answering, which requires the model to navigate across multiple documents and generate comprehensive responses based on fragmented information. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel Knowledge Graph-based RAG framework with a hierarchical knowledge retriever, termed KG-Retriever. The retrieval indexing in KG-Retriever is constructed on a hierarchical index graph that consists of a knowledge graph layer and a collaborative document layer. The associative nature of graph structures is fully utilized to strengthen intra-document and inter-document connectivity, thereby fundamentally alleviating the information fragmentation problem and meanwhile improving the retrieval efficiency in cross-document retrieval of LLMs. With the coarse-grained collaborative information from neighboring documents and concise information from the knowledge graph, KG-Retriever achieves marked improvements on five public QA datasets, showing the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed RAG framework.

Abstract: Image editing has advanced significantly with the development of diffusion models using both inversion-based and instruction-based methods. However, current inversion-based approaches struggle with big modifications (e.g., adding or removing objects) due to the structured nature of inversion noise, which hinders substantial changes. Meanwhile, instruction-based methods often constrain users to black-box operations, limiting direct interaction for specifying editing regions and intensity. To address these limitations, we propose BrushEdit, a novel inpainting-based instruction-guided image editing paradigm, which leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image inpainting models to enable autonomous, user-friendly, and interactive free-form instruction editing. Specifically, we devise a system enabling free-form instruction editing by integrating MLLMs and a dual-branch image inpainting model in an agent-cooperative framework to perform editing category classification, main object identification, mask acquisition, and editing area inpainting. Extensive experiments show that our framework effectively combines MLLMs and inpainting models, achieving superior performance across seven metrics including mask region preservation and editing effect coherence.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is an important machine learning task with many real-world uses, including fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and industrial monitoring. Within natural language processing (NLP), AD helps detect issues like spam, misinformation, and unusual user activity. Although large language models (LLMs) have had a strong impact on tasks such as text generation and summarization, their potential in AD has not been studied enough. This paper introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark that evaluates how LLMs can help with NLP anomaly detection. We examine three key tasks: (i) zero-shot detection, using LLMs' pre-trained knowledge to perform AD without tasks-specific training; (ii) data augmentation, generating synthetic data and category descriptions to improve AD models; and (iii) model selection, using LLMs to suggest unsupervised AD models. Through experiments with different datasets, we find that LLMs can work well in zero-shot AD, that carefully designed augmentation methods are useful, and that explaining model selection for specific datasets remains challenging. Based on these results, we outline six future research directions on LLMs for AD.

Abstract: Bidirectional transformers excel at sentiment analysis, and Large Language Models (LLM) are effective zero-shot learners. Might they perform better as a team? This paper explores collaborative approaches between ELECTRA and GPT-4o for three-way sentiment classification. We fine-tuned (FT) four models (ELECTRA Base/Large, GPT-4o/4o-mini) using a mix of reviews from Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) and DynaSent. We provided input from ELECTRA to GPT as: predicted label, probabilities, and retrieved examples. Sharing ELECTRA Base FT predictions with GPT-4o-mini significantly improved performance over either model alone (82.50 macro F1 vs. 79.14 ELECTRA Base FT, 79.41 GPT-4o-mini) and yielded the lowest cost/performance ratio (\$0.12/F1 point). However, when GPT models were fine-tuned, including predictions decreased performance. GPT-4o FT-M was the top performer (86.99), with GPT-4o-mini FT close behind (86.70) at much less cost (\$0.38 vs. \$1.59/F1 point). Our results show that augmenting prompts with predictions from fine-tuned encoders is an efficient way to boost performance, and a fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini is nearly as good as GPT-4o FT at 76% less cost. Both are affordable options for projects with limited resources.

Abstract: Predicting Bitcoin price remains a challenging problem due to the high volatility and complex non-linear dynamics of cryptocurrency markets. Traditional time-series models, such as ARIMA and GARCH, and recurrent neural networks, like LSTMs, have been widely applied to this task but struggle to capture the regime shifts and long-range dependencies inherent in the data. In this work, we propose CryptoMamba, a novel Mamba-based State Space Model (SSM) architecture designed to effectively capture long-range dependencies in financial time-series data. Our experiments show that CryptoMamba not only provides more accurate predictions but also offers enhanced generalizability across different market conditions, surpassing the limitations of previous models. Coupled with trading algorithms for real-world scenarios, CryptoMamba demonstrates its practical utility by translating accurate forecasts into financial outcomes. Our findings signal a huge advantage for SSMs in stock and cryptocurrency price forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Anatomical landmark localization in 2D/3D images is a critical task in medical imaging. Although many general-purpose tools exist for landmark localization in classical computer vision tasks, such as pose estimation, they lack the specialized features and modularity necessary for anatomical landmark localization applications in the medical domain. Therefore, we introduce landmarker, a Python package built on PyTorch. The package provides a comprehensive, flexible toolkit for developing and evaluating landmark localization algorithms, supporting a range of methodologies, including static and adaptive heatmap regression. landmarker enhances the accuracy of landmark identification, streamlines research and development processes, and supports various image formats and preprocessing pipelines. Its modular design allows users to customize and extend the toolkit for specific datasets and applications, accelerating innovation in medical imaging. landmarker addresses a critical need for precision and customization in landmark localization tasks not adequately met by existing general-purpose pose estimation tools.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence involves understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying visual reasoning in sophisticated models like Vision-Language Models (VLMs). How do these models integrate visual perception with abstract thought, especially when reasoning across multiple images or requiring fine-grained compositional understanding? Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, this paper introduces a structured evaluation framework using diverse visual reasoning tasks-Bongard Problems (BPs) and Winoground-to dissect the perception-reasoning interface in VLMs. We propose three distinct evaluation paradigms, mirroring human problem-solving strategies: Direct Visual Rule Learning (DVRL; holistic processing), Deductive Rule Learning (DRL; rule extraction and application), and Componential Analysis (CA; analytical decomposition via task-agnostic textual descriptions). These paradigms systematically vary cognitive load and probe processing stages. Notably, CA enables multi-image reasoning evaluation even for single-image architectures and isolates reasoning from perception by operating on textual descriptions. Applying this framework, we demonstrate that CA, leveraging powerful language models for reasoning over rich, independently generated descriptions, achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on challenging benchmarks including Bongard-OpenWorld, Bongard-HOI, and Winoground. Ablation studies confirm reasoning improves significantly when perceptual challenges are mitigated, revealing a critical perception bottleneck. Our framework provides a valuable diagnostic tool and suggests that decoupling perception (via rich, task-agnostic description) from reasoning is a promising direction for robust and general visual intelligence.

Abstract: The dream of achieving a student-teacher ratio of 1:1 is closer than ever thanks to the emergence of large language models (LLMs). One potential application of these models in the educational field would be to provide feedback to students in university introductory programming courses, so that a student struggling to solve a basic implementation problem could seek help from an LLM available 24/7. This article focuses on studying three aspects related to such an application. First, the performance of two well-known models, GPT-3.5T and GPT-4T, in providing feedback to students is evaluated. The empirical results showed that GPT-4T performs much better than GPT-3.5T, however, it is not yet ready for use in a real-world scenario. This is due to the possibility of generating incorrect information that potential users may not always be able to detect. Second, the article proposes a carefully designed prompt using in-context learning techniques that allows automating important parts of the evaluation process, as well as providing a lower bound for the fraction of feedbacks containing incorrect information, saving time and effort. This was possible because the resulting feedback has a programmatically analyzable structure that incorporates diagnostic information about the LLM's performance in solving the requested task. Third, the article also suggests a possible strategy for implementing a practical learning tool based on LLMs, which is rooted on the proposed prompting techniques. This strategy opens up a whole range of interesting possibilities from a pedagogical perspective.

Abstract: The integration of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) into visuo-motor robot learning has emerged as a promising alternative to training visual encoders from scratch. However, PVRs face critical challenges in the context of policy learning, including temporal entanglement and an inability to generalise even in the presence of minor scene perturbations. These limitations hinder performance in tasks requiring temporal awareness and robustness to scene changes. This work identifies these shortcomings and proposes solutions to address them. First, we augment PVR features with temporal perception and a sense of task completion, effectively disentangling them in time. Second, we introduce a module that learns to selectively attend to task-relevant local features, enhancing robustness when evaluated on out-of-distribution scenes. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements, particularly in PVRs trained with masking objectives, and validate the effectiveness of our enhancements in addressing PVR-specific limitations.

<title>Unveiling the Mechanisms of Explicit CoT Training: How CoT Enhances Reasoning Generalization</title>

Abstract: The integration of explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into training large language models (LLMs) has advanced their reasoning capabilities, yet the mechanisms by which CoT enhances generalization remain poorly understood. This work investigates (1) \textit{how} CoT training reshapes internal model representations and (2) \textit{why} it improves both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning generalization. Through controlled experiments and theoretical analysis, we derive the following key insights. \textbf{1)} Structural Advantage: CoT training internalizes reasoning into a two-stage generalizing circuit, where the number of stages corresponds to the explicit reasoning steps during training. Notably, CoT-trained models resolve intermediate results at shallower layers compared to non-CoT counterparts, freeing up deeper layers to specialize in subsequent reasoning steps. \textbf{2)} Theoretical Analysis: the information-theoretic generalization bounds via distributional divergence can be decomposed into ID and OOD components. While ID error diminishes with sufficient training regardless of CoT, OOD error critically depends on CoT: Non-CoT training fails to generalize to OOD samples due to unseen reasoning patterns, whereas CoT training achieves near-perfect OOD generalization by mastering subtasks and reasoning compositions during training. The identified mechanisms explain our experimental results: CoT training accelerates convergence and enhances generalization from ID to both ID and OOD scenarios while maintaining robust performance even with tolerable noise. These findings are further validated on complex real-world datasets. This paper offers valuable insights for designing CoT strategies to enhance LLM reasoning robustness.

<title>Model-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning with Reliability-Guaranteed Sequence Modeling</title>

Abstract: Model-based offline reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to learn a policy by exploiting a dynamics model derived from an existing dataset. Applying conservative quantification to the dynamics model, most existing works on MORL generate trajectories that approximate the real data distribution to facilitate policy learning by using current information (e.g., the state and action at time step $t$). However, these works neglect the impact of historical information on environmental dynamics, leading to the generation of unreliable trajectories that may not align with the real data distribution. In this paper, we propose a new MORL algorithm \textbf{R}eliability-guaranteed \textbf{T}ransformer (RT), which can eliminate unreliable trajectories by calculating the cumulative reliability of the generated trajectory (i.e., using a weighted variational distance away from the real data). Moreover, by sampling candidate actions with high rewards, RT can efficiently generate high-return trajectories from the existing offline data. We theoretically prove the performance guarantees of RT in policy learning, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness against state-of-the-art model-based methods on several benchmark tasks.

arXiv:2502.15666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for text generation has led to widespread concerns about AI-generated content detection. However, an overlooked challenge is AI-polished text, where human-written content undergoes subtle refinements using AI tools. This raises a critical question: should minimally polished text be classified as AI-generated? Such classification can lead to false plagiarism accusations and misleading claims about AI prevalence in online content. In this study, we systematically evaluate twelve state-of-the-art AI-text detectors using our AI-Polished-Text Evaluation (APT-Eval) dataset, which contains 14.7K samples refined at varying AI-involvement levels. Our findings reveal that detectors frequently flag even minimally polished text as AI-generated, struggle to differentiate between degrees of AI involvement, and exhibit biases against older and smaller models. These limitations highlight the urgent need for more nuanced detection methodologies.

<title>Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.17424v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding. It asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned. Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment. In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger. It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.

Abstract: Human activity is moderated by norms. However, machines are often trained without explicit supervision on norm understanding and reasoning, particularly when norms are physically- or socially-grounded. To improve and evaluate the normative reasoning capability of vision-language models (VLMs), we present \dataset{} $\|\epsilon\|$, consisting of 1,853 challenging, multi-stage MCQ questions based on ego-centric videos of human interactions, evaluating both the prediction and justification of normative actions. The normative actions encompass seven categories: safety, privacy, proxemics, politeness, cooperation, coordination/proactivity, and communication/legibility. To compile this dataset at scale, we propose a novel pipeline leveraging video sampling, automatic answer generation, filtering, and human validation. Our work demonstrates that current state-of-the-art vision-language models lack robust norm understanding, scoring a maximum of 54\% on \dataset{} (versus a human bench of 92\%). Our analysis of performance in each dimension highlights the significant risks of safety, privacy, and the lack of collaboration and communication capability when applied to real-world agents. We additionally show that through a retrieval-based generation (RAG) method, it is possible to use \dataset{} to enhance normative reasoning in VLMs.

arXiv:2502.20727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid expansion in the scale of large language models (LLMs), enabling efficient distributed inference across multiple computing units has become increasingly critical. However, communication overheads from popular distributed inference techniques such as Tensor Parallelism pose a significant challenge to achieve scalability and low latency. Therefore, we introduce a novel optimization technique, Sync-Point Drop (SPD), to reduce communication overheads in tensor parallelism by selectively dropping synchronization on attention outputs. In detail, we first propose a block design that allows execution to proceed without communication through SPD. Second, we apply different SPD strategies to attention blocks based on their sensitivity to the model accuracy. The proposed methods effectively alleviate communication bottlenecks while minimizing accuracy degradation during LLM inference, offering a scalable solution for diverse distributed environments: SPD offered about 20% overall inference latency reduction with < 1% accuracy regression for LLaMA2-70B inference over 8 GPUs.

arXiv:2503.03269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers with linear attention offer significant computational advantages over softmax-based transformers but often suffer from degraded performance. The symmetric power (sympow) transformer, a particular type of linear transformer, addresses some of this performance gap by leveraging symmetric tensor embeddings, achieving comparable performance to softmax transformers. However, the finite capacity of the recurrent state in sympow transformers limits their ability to retain information, leading to performance degradation when scaling the training or evaluation context length. To address this issue, we propose the conformal-sympow transformer, which dynamically frees up capacity using data-dependent multiplicative gating and adaptively stores information using data-dependent rotary embeddings. Preliminary experiments on the LongCrawl64 dataset demonstrate that conformal-sympow overcomes the limitations of sympow transformers, achieving robust performance across scaled training and evaluation contexts.

arXiv:2503.05153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective trajectory stitching for long-horizon planning is a significant challenge in robotic decision-making. While diffusion models have shown promise in planning, they are limited to solving tasks similar to those seen in their training data. We propose CompDiffuser, a novel generative approach that can solve new tasks by learning to compositionally stitch together shorter trajectory chunks from previously seen tasks. Our key insight is modeling the trajectory distribution by subdividing it into overlapping chunks and learning their conditional relationships through a single bidirectional diffusion model. This allows information to propagate between segments during generation, ensuring physically consistent connections. We conduct experiments on benchmark tasks of various difficulties, covering different environment sizes, agent state dimension, trajectory types, training data quality, and show that CompDiffuser significantly outperforms existing methods.

<title>Geometric Knowledge-Guided Localized Global Distribution Alignment for Federated Learning</title>

arXiv:2503.06457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data heterogeneity in federated learning, characterized by a significant misalignment between local and global distributions, leads to divergent local optimization directions and hinders global model training. Existing studies mainly focus on optimizing local updates or global aggregation, but these indirect approaches demonstrate instability when handling highly heterogeneous data distributions, especially in scenarios where label skew and domain skew coexist. To address this, we propose a geometry-guided data generation method that centers on simulating the global embedding distribution locally. We first introduce the concept of the geometric shape of an embedding distribution and then address the challenge of obtaining global geometric shapes under privacy constraints. Subsequently, we propose GGEUR, which leverages global geometric shapes to guide the generation of new samples, enabling a closer approximation to the ideal global distribution. In single-domain scenarios, we augment samples based on global geometric shapes to enhance model generalization; in multi-domain scenarios, we further employ class prototypes to simulate the global distribution across domains. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the performance of existing approaches in handling highly heterogeneous data, including scenarios with label skew, domain skew, and their coexistence.

Abstract: Queer people are often discussed as targets of bias, harm, or discrimination in research on generative AI. However, the specific ways that queer people engage with generative AI, and thus possible uses that support queer people, have yet to be explored. We conducted a workshop study with 13 queer artists, during which we gave participants access to GPT-4 and DALL-E 3 and facilitated group sensemaking activities. We found our participants struggled to use these models due to various normative values embedded in their designs, such as hyper-positivity and anti-sexuality. We describe various strategies our participants developed to overcome these models' limitations and how, nevertheless, our participants found value in these highly-normative technologies. Drawing on queer feminist theory, we discuss implications for the conceptualization of "state-of-the-art" models and consider how FAccT researchers might support queer alternatives.

arXiv:2503.20500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural receivers have recently become a popular topic, where the received signals can be directly decoded by data driven mechanisms such as machine learning and deep learning. In this paper, we propose two novel neural network based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receivers performing channel estimation and equalization tasks and directly predicting log likelihood ratios (LLRs) from the received in phase and quadrature phase (IQ) signals. The first network, the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), employs a state of the art (SOTA) transformer architecture with an attention mechanism. The second network, the Residual Dual Non Local Attention Network (RDNLA), utilizes a parallel residual architecture with a non local attention block. The bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) performance of various SOTA neural receiver architectures is compared with our proposed methods across different signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels. The simulation results show that DAT and RDNLA outperform both traditional communication systems and existing neural receiver models. The computational efficiency of the proposed neural receivers supports their feasibility for next generation communication systems.

<title>A Survey on Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models: What, How, Where, and How Well?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24235</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2503.24235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As enthusiasm for scaling computation (data and parameters) in the pretraining era gradually diminished, test-time scaling (TTS), also referred to as ``test-time computing'' has emerged as a prominent research focus. Recent studies demonstrate that TTS can further elicit the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling significant breakthroughs not only in specialized reasoning tasks, such as mathematics and coding, but also in general tasks like open-ended Q&amp;A. However, despite the explosion of recent efforts in this area, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive survey offering a systemic understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a unified, multidimensional framework structured along four core dimensions of TTS research: what to scale, how to scale, where to scale, and how well to scale. Building upon this taxonomy, we conduct an extensive review of methods, application scenarios, and assessment aspects, and present an organized decomposition that highlights the unique functional roles of individual techniques within the broader TTS landscape. From this analysis, we distill the major developmental trajectories of TTS to date and offer hands-on guidelines for practical deployment. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges and offer insights into promising future directions, including further scaling, clarifying the functional essence of techniques, generalizing to more tasks, and more attributions.

<title>Noise Augmented Fine Tuning for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.03302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce inaccurate or misleading content-hallucinations. To address this challenge, we introduce Noise-Augmented Fine-Tuning (NoiseFiT), a novel framework that leverages adaptive noise injection based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to enhance model robustness. In particular, NoiseFiT selectively perturbs layers identified as either high-SNR (more robust) or low-SNR (potentially under-regularized) using a dynamically scaled Gaussian noise. We further propose a hybrid loss that combines standard cross-entropy, soft cross-entropy, and consistency regularization to ensure stable and accurate outputs under noisy training conditions. Our theoretical analysis shows that adaptive noise injection is both unbiased and variance-preserving, providing strong guarantees for convergence in expectation. Empirical results on multiple test and benchmark datasets demonstrate that NoiseFiT significantly reduces hallucination rates, often improving or matching baseline performance in key tasks. These findings highlight the promise of noise-driven strategies for achieving robust, trustworthy language modeling without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Given the comprehensive and detailed nature of our experiments, we have publicly released the fine-tuning logs, benchmark evaluation artifacts, and source code online at W&amp;B, Hugging Face, and GitHub, respectively, to foster further research, accessibility and reproducibility.

Abstract: Training effective AI agents for multi-turn interactions requires high-quality data that captures realistic human-agent dynamics, yet such data is scarce and expensive to collect manually. We introduce APIGen-MT, a two-phase framework that generates verifiable and diverse multi-turn agent data. In the first phase, our agentic pipeline produces detailed task blueprints with ground-truth actions, leveraging a committee of LLM reviewers and iterative feedback loops. These blueprints are then transformed into complete interaction trajectories through simulated human-agent interplay. We train a family of models -- the xLAM-2-fc-r series with sizes ranging from 1B to 70B parameters. Our models outperform frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 on $\tau$-bench and BFCL benchmarks, with the smaller models surpassing their larger counterparts, particularly in multi-turn settings, while maintaining superior consistency across multiple trials. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our verified blueprint-to-details approach yields high-quality training data, enabling the development of more reliable, efficient, and capable agents. We open-source 5K synthetic data trajectories and the trained xLAM-2-fc-r models to advance research in AI agents.

arXiv:2504.04592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a setting where a pre-trained agent is operating in an environment and a human operator can decide to temporarily terminate its operation and take-over for some duration of time. These kind of scenarios are common in human-machine interactions, for example in autonomous driving, factory automation and healthcare. In these settings, we typically observe a trade-off between two extreme cases -- if no take-overs are allowed, then the agent might employ a sub-optimal, possibly dangerous policy. Alternatively, if there are too many take-overs, then the human has no confidence in the agent, greatly limiting its usefulness. In this paper, we formalize this setup and propose an explainability scheme to help optimize the number of human interventions.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic, provides a standardized framework for artificial intelligence (AI) systems to interact with external data sources and tools in real-time. While MCP offers significant advantages for AI integration and capability extension, it introduces novel security challenges that demand rigorous analysis and mitigation. This paper builds upon foundational research into MCP architecture and preliminary security assessments to deliver enterprise-grade mitigation frameworks and detailed technical implementation strategies. Through systematic threat modeling and analysis of MCP implementations and analysis of potential attack vectors, including sophisticated threats like tool poisoning, we present actionable security patterns tailored for MCP implementers and adopters. The primary contribution of this research lies in translating theoretical security concerns into a practical, implementable framework with actionable controls, thereby providing essential guidance for the secure enterprise adoption and governance of integrated AI systems.

Abstract: This technical report presents a cost-efficient strategy for training a video generation foundation model. We present a mid-sized research model with approximately 7 billion parameters (7B) called Seaweed-7B trained from scratch using 665,000 H100 GPU hours. Despite being trained with moderate computational resources, Seaweed-7B demonstrates highly competitive performance compared to contemporary video generation models of much larger size. Design choices are especially crucial in a resource-constrained setting. This technical report highlights the key design decisions that enhance the performance of the medium-sized diffusion model. Empirically, we make two observations: (1) Seaweed-7B achieves performance comparable to, or even surpasses, larger models trained on substantially greater GPU resources, and (2) our model, which exhibits strong generalization ability, can be effectively adapted across a wide range of downstream applications either by lightweight fine-tuning or continue training.

Abstract: Recently, slow-thinking systems like GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated great potential in solving challenging problems through explicit reflection. They significantly outperform the best fast-thinking models, such as GPT-4o, on various math and science benchmarks. However, their multimodal reasoning capabilities remain on par with fast-thinking models. For instance, GPT-o1's performance on benchmarks like MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision is similar to fast-thinking models. In this paper, we aim to enhance the slow-thinking capabilities of vision-language models using reinforcement learning (without relying on distillation) to advance the state of the art. First, we adapt the GRPO algorithm with a novel technique called Selective Sample Replay (SSR) to address the vanishing advantages problem. While this approach yields strong performance, the resulting RL-trained models exhibit limited self-reflection or self-verification. To further encourage slow-thinking, we introduce Forced Rethinking, which appends a rethinking trigger token to the end of rollouts in RL training, explicitly enforcing a self-reflection reasoning step. By combining these two techniques, our model, VL-Rethinker, advances state-of-the-art scores on MathVista, MathVerse to achieve 80.4%, 63.5% respectively. VL-Rethinker also achieves open-source SoTA on multi-disciplinary benchmarks such as MathVision, MMMU-Pro, EMMA, and MEGA-Bench, narrowing the gap with OpenAI-o1. Our empirical results show the effectiveness of our approaches.

However, computing the exact KL divergence between two arbitrary language models is intractable. Thus, practitioners often resort to the use of sampling-based estimators. While it is easy to fashion a simple Monte Carlo (MC) estimator that provides an unbiased estimate of the KL divergence between language models, this estimator notoriously suffers from high variance, and can even result in a negative estimate of the KL divergence, a non-negative quantity. In this paper, we introduce a Rao--Blackwellized estimator that is also unbiased and provably has variance less than or equal to that of the standard Monte Carlo estimator. In an empirical study on sentiment-controlled fine-tuning, we show that our estimator provides more stable KL estimates and reduces variance substantially in practice. Additionally, we derive an analogous Rao--Blackwellized estimator of the gradient of the KL divergence, which leads to more stable training and produces models that more frequently appear on the Pareto frontier of reward vs. KL compared to the ones trained with the MC estimator of the gradient.

Abstract: The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater improvements in the few NFEs regime.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language multimodal models (LMMs) for video have demonstrated their potential for understanding video content, yet the task of comprehending multi-discipline lectures remains largely unexplored. We introduce Video-MMLU, a massive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of LMMs in understanding Multi-Discipline Lectures. We evaluate over 90 open-source and proprietary models, ranging from 0.5B to 40B parameters. Our results highlight the limitations of current models in addressing the cognitive challenges presented by these lectures, especially in tasks requiring both perception and reasoning. Additionally, we explore how the number of visual tokens and the large language models influence performance, offering insights into the interplay between multimodal perception and reasoning in lecture comprehension.

Abstract: Code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential tools in modern software development, enhancing productivity and accelerating development. This paper aims to investigate the fine-tuning of code-generating LLMs using Reinforcement Learning and Direct Preference Optimization, further improving their performance. To achieve this, we enhance the training data for the reward model with the help of symbolic execution techniques, ensuring more comprehensive and objective data. With symbolic execution, we create a custom dataset that better captures the nuances in code evaluation. Our reward models, fine-tuned on this dataset, demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline, CodeRL, in estimating the quality of generated code. Our code-generating LLMs, trained with the help of reward model feedback, achieve similar results compared to the CodeRL benchmark.

<title>FairTranslate: An English-French Dataset for Gender Bias Evaluation in Machine Translation by Overcoming Gender Binarity</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly leveraged for translation tasks but often fall short when translating inclusive language -- such as texts containing the singular 'they' pronoun or otherwise reflecting fair linguistic protocols. Because these challenges span both computational and societal domains, it is imperative to critically evaluate how well LLMs handle inclusive translation with a well-founded framework.
  This paper presents FairTranslate, a novel, fully human-annotated dataset designed to evaluate non-binary gender biases in machine translation systems from English to French. FairTranslate includes 2418 English-French sentence pairs related to occupations, annotated with rich metadata such as the stereotypical alignment of the occupation, grammatical gender indicator ambiguity, and the ground-truth gender label (male, female, or inclusive).
  We evaluate four leading LLMs (Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B, Llama3.1-8B, Llama3.3-70B) on this dataset under different prompting procedures. Our results reveal substantial biases in gender representation across LLMs, highlighting persistent challenges in achieving equitable outcomes in machine translation. These findings underscore the need for focused strategies and interventions aimed at ensuring fair and inclusive language usage in LLM-based translation systems.
  We make the FairTranslate dataset publicly available on Hugging Face, and disclose the code for all experiments on GitHub.

Abstract: As Agentic AI systems evolve from basic workflows to complex multi agent collaboration, robust protocols such as Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) become essential enablers. To foster secure adoption and ensure the reliability of these complex interactions, understanding the secure implementation of A2A is essential. This paper addresses this goal by providing a comprehensive security analysis centered on the A2A protocol. We examine its fundamental elements and operational dynamics, situating it within the framework of agent communication development. Utilizing the MAESTRO framework, specifically designed for AI risks, we apply proactive threat modeling to assess potential security issues in A2A deployments, focusing on aspects such as Agent Card management, task execution integrity, and authentication methodologies.
  Based on these insights, we recommend practical secure development methodologies and architectural best practices designed to build resilient and effective A2A systems. Our analysis also explores how the synergy between A2A and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) can further enhance secure interoperability. This paper equips developers and architects with the knowledge and practical guidance needed to confidently leverage the A2A protocol for building robust and secure next generation agentic applications.

<title>Neural operators struggle to learn complex PDEs in pedestrian mobility: Hughes model case study</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18267</link>

arXiv:2504.18267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of neural operators in learning solutions for a Hughes model, a first-order hyperbolic conservation law system for crowd dynamics. The model couples a Fokker-Planck equation representing pedestrian density with a Hamilton-Jacobi-type (eikonal) equation. This Hughes model belongs to the class of nonlinear hyperbolic systems that often exhibit complex solution structures, including shocks and discontinuities. In this study, we assess the performance of three state-of-the-art neural operators (Fourier Neural Operator, Wavelet Neural Operator, and Multiwavelet Neural Operator) in various challenging scenarios. Specifically, we consider (1) discontinuous and Gaussian initial conditions and (2) diverse boundary conditions, while also examining the impact of different numerical schemes.
  Our results show that these neural operators perform well in easy scenarios with fewer discontinuities in the initial condition, yet they struggle in complex scenarios with multiple initial discontinuities and dynamic boundary conditions, even when trained specifically on such complex samples. The predicted solutions often appear smoother, resulting in a reduction in total variation and a loss of important physical features. This smoothing behavior is similar to issues discussed by Daganzo (1995), where models that introduce artificial diffusion were shown to miss essential features such as shock waves in hyperbolic systems. These results suggest that current neural operator architectures may introduce unintended regularization effects that limit their ability to capture transport dynamics governed by discontinuities. They also raise concerns about generalizing these methods to traffic applications where shock preservation is essential.

Summary:
ROSA is a knowledge-based framework designed for RObot Self-Adaptation, allowing for task-and-architecture co-adaptation in robotic systems. It utilizes a knowledge model to capture application-specific information needed for adaptation and reasons over this data at runtime to determine when and how adaptation should take place.

Abstract: Autonomous robots must operate in diverse environments and handle multiple tasks despite uncertainties. This creates challenges in designing software architectures and task decision-making algorithms, as different contexts may require distinct task logic and architectural configurations. To address this, robotic systems can be designed as self-adaptive systems capable of adapting their task execution and software architecture at runtime based on their context.This paper introduces ROSA, a novel knowledge-based framework for RObot Self-Adaptation, which enables task-and-architecture co-adaptation (TACA) in robotic systems. ROSA achieves this by providing a knowledge model that captures all application-specific knowledge required for adaptation and by reasoning over this knowledge at runtime to determine when and how adaptation should occur. In addition to a conceptual framework, this work provides an open-source ROS 2-based reference implementation of ROSA and evaluates its feasibility and performance in an underwater robotics application. Experimental results highlight ROSA's advantages in reusability and development effort for designing self-adaptive robotic systems.

Abstract: Howard's Policy Iteration (HPI) is a classic algorithm for solving Markov Decision Problems (MDPs). HPI uses a "greedy" switching rule to update from any non-optimal policy to a dominating one, iterating until an optimal policy is found. Despite its introduction over 60 years ago, the best-known upper bounds on HPI's running time remain exponential in the number of states -- indeed even on the restricted class of MDPs with only deterministic transitions (DMDPs). Meanwhile, the tightest lower bound for HPI for MDPs with a constant number of actions per state is only linear. In this paper, we report a significant improvement: a subexponential upper bound for HPI on DMDPs, which is parameterised by the bit-size of the rewards, while independent of the discount factor. The same upper bound also applies to DMDPs with only two possible rewards (which may be of arbitrary size).

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in areas that significantly impact human lives, concerns about fairness and transparency have grown, especially regarding their impact on protected groups. Recently, the intersection of explainability and fairness has emerged as an important area to promote responsible AI systems. This paper explores how explainability methods can be leveraged to detect and interpret unfairness. We propose a pipeline that integrates local post-hoc explanation methods to derive fairness-related insights. During the pipeline design, we identify and address critical questions arising from the use of explanations as bias detectors such as the relationship between distributive and procedural fairness, the effect of removing the protected attribute, the consistency and quality of results across different explanation methods, the impact of various aggregation strategies of local explanations on group fairness evaluations, and the overall trustworthiness of explanations as bias detectors. Our results show the potential of explanation methods used for fairness while highlighting the need to carefully consider the aforementioned critical aspects.

Summary: 
Clinical risk prediction in healthcare relies on high-quality time series clinical event data. The MIMIC-\RNum{4}-Ext-22MCTS dataset, containing 22,588,586 clinical events extracted from discharge summaries of MIMIC-IV-Note, addresses challenges of lengthy summaries and missing timestamps. A framework is proposed to break down summaries, retrieve relevant chunks using contextual search, and teach Llama-3.1-8B model to identify temporal information. Models fine-tuned on this dataset show significant improvements, with a BERT model achieving 10% accuracy increase in medical question answering and 3% in clinical trial matching tasks compared to classic BERT. GPT-2 also produces more reliable clinical results for questions when fine-tuned on this dataset.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical risk prediction based on machine learning algorithms plays a vital role in modern healthcare. A crucial component in developing a reliable prediction model is collecting high-quality time series clinical events. In this work, we release such a dataset that consists of 22,588,586 Clinical Time Series events, which we term MIMIC-\RNum{4}-Ext-22MCTS. Our source data are discharge summaries selected from the well-known yet unstructured MIMIC-IV-Note \cite{Johnson2023-pg}. We then extract clinical events as short text span from the discharge summaries, along with the timestamps of these events as temporal information. The general-purpose MIMIC-IV-Note pose specific challenges for our work: it turns out that the discharge summaries are too lengthy for typical natural language models to process, and the clinical events of interest often are not accompanied with explicit timestamps. Therefore, we propose a new framework that works as follows: 1) we break each discharge summary into manageably small text chunks; 2) we apply contextual BM25 and contextual semantic search to retrieve chunks that have a high potential of containing clinical events; and 3) we carefully design prompts to teach the recently released Llama-3.1-8B \cite{touvron2023llama} model to identify or infer temporal information of the chunks. We show that the obtained dataset is so informative and transparent that standard models fine-tuned on our dataset are achieving significant improvements in healthcare applications. In particular, the BERT model fine-tuned based on our dataset achieves 10\% improvement in accuracy on medical question answering task, and 3\% improvement in clinical trial matching task compared with the classic BERT. The GPT-2 model, fine-tuned on our dataset, produces more clinically reliable results for clinical questions.

Summary: 
Agentic pipelines, involving multiple LLMs with minimal human control, pose challenges for human-centered explainability. The HCXAI community is exploring ways to make the inner workings of LLMs more transparent and actionable. A perceptive task guidance system implemented in an agentic pipeline was studied, revealing that CoT reasoning, often used for explainability in LLMs, did not consistently improve outputs or offer meaningful explanations. The study found that CoT reasoning alone did not enhance user understanding or goal achievement. This research highlights the complexity of achieving explainability in agentic pipelines and the limitations of relying solely on CoT reasoning for this purpose. <div>

Abstract: Agentic pipelines present novel challenges and opportunities for human-centered explainability. The HCXAI community is still grappling with how best to make the inner workings of LLMs transparent in actionable ways. Agentic pipelines consist of multiple LLMs working in cooperation with minimal human control. In this research paper, we present early findings from an agentic pipeline implementation of a perceptive task guidance system. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we analyze how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, a common vehicle for explainability in LLMs, operates within agentic pipelines. We demonstrate that CoT reasoning alone does not lead to better outputs, nor does it offer explainability, as it tends to produce explanations without explainability, in that they do not improve the ability of end users to better understand systems or achieve their goals.

Abstract: Driver assistance systems provide a wide range of crucial services, including closely monitoring the condition of vehicles. This paper showcases a groundbreaking sensor health monitoring system designed for the automotive industry. The ingenious system leverages cutting-edge techniques to process data collected from various vehicle sensors. It compares their outputs within the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to evaluate the health of each sensor. To unravel the intricate correlations between sensor data, an extensive exploration of machine learning and deep learning methodologies was conducted. Through meticulous analysis, the most correlated sensor data were identified. These valuable insights were then utilized to provide accurate estimations of sensor values. Among the diverse learning methods examined, the combination of autoencoders for detecting sensor failures and random forest regression for estimating sensor values proved to yield the most impressive outcomes. A statistical model using the normal distribution has been developed to identify possible sensor failures proactively. By comparing the actual values of the sensors with their estimated values based on correlated sensors, faulty sensors can be detected early. When a defective sensor is detected, both the driver and the maintenance department are promptly alerted. Additionally, the system replaces the value of the faulty sensor with the estimated value obtained through analysis. This proactive approach was evaluated using data from twenty essential sensors in the Saipa's Quick vehicle's ECU, resulting in an impressive accuracy rate of 99\%.

arXiv:2505.00972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based testing is crucial for validating autonomous vehicles (AVs), yet existing scenario generation methods either overfit to common driving patterns or operate in an offline, non-interactive manner that fails to expose rare, safety-critical corner cases. In this paper, we introduce an online, retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework for generating safety-critical driving scenarios. Our method first employs an LLM-based behavior analyzer to infer the most dangerous intent of the background vehicle from the observed state, then queries additional LLM agents to synthesize feasible adversarial trajectories. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting and accelerate adaptation, we augment the framework with a dynamic memorization and retrieval bank of intent-planner pairs, automatically expanding its behavioral library when novel intents arise. Evaluations using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our model reduces the mean minimum time-to-collision from 1.62 to 1.08 s and incurs a 75% collision rate, substantially outperforming baselines.

Summary:
This article discusses the use of in-context learning to improve the planning capability of large language models (LLMs). The study explores how signal selection can impact model performance, with a focus on filtering exemplars based on action sequence similarity. A two-stage pipeline, GRASE-DC, is proposed to re-sample and curate exemplars for improved planning accuracy. Experimental results show significant performance enhancements on various planning tasks, with up to 40 point absolute accuracy improvement and reduced exemplar usage. GRASE-DC* + VAL, incorporating a validator, further boosts performance by 18.9%. Analysis confirms consistent performance gains across different LLMs and planning benchmarks. Notably, using simpler problems as exemplars can improve planning accuracy on more challenging tasks, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize to new problems. <div>

Abstract: Planning is essential for artificial intelligence systems to look ahead and proactively determine a course of actions to reach objectives in the virtual and real world. Recent work on large language models (LLMs) sheds light on their planning capability in various tasks. However, it remains unclear what signals in the context influence the model performance. In this work, we explore how to improve the model planning capability through in-context learning (ICL), specifically, what signals can help select the exemplars. Through extensive experiments, we observe that commonly used problem similarity may result in false positives with drastically different plans, which can mislead the model. In response, we propose to sample and filter exemplars leveraging plan side action sequence similarity (AS). We propose GRASE-DC: a two-stage pipeline that first re-samples high AS exemplars and then curates the selected exemplars with dynamic clustering on AS to achieve a balance of relevance and diversity. Our experimental result confirms that GRASE-DC achieves significant performance improvement on various planning tasks (up to ~11-40 point absolute accuracy improvement with 27.3% fewer exemplars needed on average). With GRASE-DC* + VAL, where we iteratively apply GRASE-DC with a validator, we are able to even boost the performance by 18.9% more.
  Extensive analysis validates the consistent performance improvement of GRASE-DC with various backbone LLMs and on both classical planning and natural language planning benchmarks. GRASE-DC can further boost the planning accuracy by ~24 absolute points on harder problems using simpler problems as exemplars over a random baseline. This demonstrates its ability to generalize to out-of-distribution problems.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses security vulnerabilities in Windows Active Directory systems. It introduces an Adaptive Path Removal Problem to optimize the process of removing edges from attack paths. The problem aims to minimize the number of interactions between security teams and IT admins. The article proves the problem's complexity and proposes solutions including exact, approximate, and heuristic algorithms. The best heuristic, called DPR, is shown to be effective on larger-scale graphs and outperforms the approximate algorithm. The algorithms' effectiveness is verified on synthetic AD graphs and an attack graph from a real organization. <div>
arXiv:2505.01028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security vulnerabilities in Windows Active Directory (AD) systems are typically modeled using an attack graph and hardening AD systems involves an iterative workflow: security teams propose an edge to remove, and IT operations teams manually review these fixes before implementing the removal. As verification requires significant manual effort, we formulate an Adaptive Path Removal Problem to minimize the number of steps in this iterative removal process. In our model, a wizard proposes an attack path in each step and presents it as a set of multiple-choice options to the IT admin. The IT admin then selects one edge from the proposed set to remove. This process continues until the target $t$ is disconnected from source $s$ or the number of proposed paths reaches $B$. The model aims to optimize the human effort by minimizing the expected number of interactions between the IT admin and the security wizard. We first prove that the problem is $\mathcal{\#P}$-hard. We then propose a set of solutions including an exact algorithm, an approximate algorithm, and several scalable heuristics. Our best heuristic, called DPR, can operate effectively on larger-scale graphs compared to the exact algorithm and consistently outperforms the approximate algorithm across all graphs. We verify the effectiveness of our algorithms on several synthetic AD graphs and an AD attack graph collected from a real organization.

Summary:
Retrial-Augmented Learning (RAL) introduces a reward-free self-supervised learning framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that avoids the need for model training. By incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as an intermediate data organization module, RAL facilitates a three-stage autonomous knowledge generation process: hypothesis generation, hypothesis validation, and knowledge generation. Through evaluation in the LLM-PySC2 environment, known for its complex decision-making requirements, RAL proves effective in reducing hallucination and improving decision-making performance at a minimal cost. The method also shows promise in out-of-distribution tasks, demonstrating robustness and transferability. Overall, RAL offers a cost-effective solution for decision-making challenges and autonomous knowledge generation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The lack of domain-specific data in the pre-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) severely limits LLM-based decision systems in specialized applications, while post-training a model in the scenarios requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we present Retrial-Augmented Learning (RAL), a reward-free self-supervised learning framework for LLMs that operates without model training. By developing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into a module for organizing intermediate data, we realized a three-stage autonomous knowledge generation of proposing a hypothesis, validating the hypothesis, and generating the knowledge. The method is evaluated in the LLM-PySC2 environment, a representative decision-making platform that combines sufficient complexity with domain-specific knowledge requirements. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces hallucination by generating and utilizing validated knowledge, and increases decision-making performance at an extremely low cost. Meanwhile, the approach exhibits potential in out-of-distribution(OOD) tasks, robustness, and transferability, making it a cost-friendly but effective solution for decision-making problems and autonomous knowledge generation.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved remarkable success in specialized tasks but struggles with efficient skill acquisition and generalization. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark evaluates intelligence based on minimal training requirements. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently improved ARC performance, they rely on extensive pre-training and high computational costs. We introduce MADIL (MDL-based AI), a novel approach leveraging the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle for efficient inductive learning. MADIL performs pattern-based decomposition, enabling structured generalization.

<div> Keywords: Swarming systems, data poisoning attacks, explainable AI methods, evolutionary intelligence, cooperative tasks<br />
Summary:<br />
Swarming systems, such as multi-drone networks, are efficient at cooperative tasks but susceptible to data poisoning attacks. A new framework using explainable AI methods investigates the effects of such attacks on team-level coordination. The framework models agent interaction through evolutionary intelligence, leading to the emergence of an optimal coalition for coordinated tasks. Rigorous evaluation shows that data manipulation attacks can disrupt team strategy, with non-optimal strategies leading to inefficient cooperation when poisoning exceeds 10%. Explainable AI methods are applied to quantify the effects of poisoning and extract footprint characterizations for diagnosis. This research highlights the importance of understanding and detecting data poisoning attacks in swarming systems to ensure effective and robust coordination among autonomous agents. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Swarming systems, such as for example multi-drone networks, excel at cooperative tasks like monitoring, surveillance, or disaster assistance in critical environments, where autonomous agents make decentralized decisions in order to fulfill team-level objectives in a robust and efficient manner. Unfortunately, team-level coordinated strategies in the wild are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, resulting in either inaccurate coordination or adversarial behavior among the agents. To address this challenge, we contribute a framework that investigates the effects of such data poisoning attacks, using explainable AI methods. We model the interaction among agents using evolutionary intelligence, where an optimal coalition strategically emerges to perform coordinated tasks. Then, through a rigorous evaluation, the swarm model is systematically poisoned using data manipulation attacks. We showcase the applicability of explainable AI methods to quantify the effects of poisoning on the team strategy and extract footprint characterizations that enable diagnosing. Our findings indicate that when the model is poisoned above 10%, non-optimal strategies resulting in inefficient cooperation can be identified.

<div> Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Explainable AI, Personality traits, Decision-making, Loan application<br />
Summary: <br />
This study explores the impact of different types of explanations provided by AI systems, as well as the influence of individual personality traits, specifically the Need for Cognition (NFC), on decision-making accuracy, reliance on AI, and cognitive load. The research found that high AI confidence increased reliance on AI and reduced cognitive load. While feature-based explanations did not significantly improve accuracy, counterfactual explanations, despite being less understandable, enhanced overall accuracy. Both low and high NFC individuals prioritized explanations over AI information, suggesting the importance of personalized XAI interfaces. Surprisingly, there were no significant differences in decision-making accuracy or cognitive load between low and high NFC groups, indicating the need for further investigation into the role of personality traits in AI-assisted decision-making. These findings emphasize the importance of user-centric design in XAI interfaces and the potential benefits of incorporating varied explanation styles to optimize human-AI collaboration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly used for decision-making across domains, raising debates over the information and explanations they should provide. Most research on Explainable AI (XAI) has focused on feature-based explanations, with less attention on alternative styles. Personality traits like the Need for Cognition (NFC) can also lead to different decision-making outcomes among low and high NFC individuals. We investigated how presenting AI information (prediction, confidence, and accuracy) and different explanation styles (example-based, feature-based, rule-based, and counterfactual) affect accuracy, reliance on AI, and cognitive load in a loan application scenario. We also examined low and high NFC individuals' differences in prioritizing XAI interface elements (loan attributes, AI information, and explanations), accuracy, and cognitive load. Our findings show that high AI confidence significantly increases reliance on AI while reducing cognitive load. Feature-based explanations did not enhance accuracy compared to other conditions. Although counterfactual explanations were less understandable, they enhanced overall accuracy, increasing reliance on AI and reducing cognitive load when AI predictions were correct. Both low and high NFC individuals prioritized explanations after loan attributes, leaving AI information as the least important. However, we found no significant differences between low and high NFC groups in accuracy or cognitive load, raising questions about the role of personality traits in AI-assisted decision-making. These findings highlight the need for user-centric personalization in XAI interfaces, incorporating diverse explanation styles and exploring multiple personality traits and other user characteristics to optimize human-AI collaboration.

Summary:
TARL is a novel approach that utilizes shapelet dynamics in heart rate time series to model illness progression and predict future changes. By creating a shapelet-transition knowledge graph and implementing a transition-aware knowledge embedding, TARL effectively handles missing values in wearable device data and provides comprehensive representations of heart rate patterns. In collaboration with healthcare professionals, TARL was evaluated using real-world ICU patient data, demonstrating high reliability and early detection capability.

Abstract: Early detection of patient deterioration is crucial for reducing mortality rates. Heart rate data has shown promise in assessing patient health, and wearable devices offer a cost-effective solution for real-time monitoring. However, extracting meaningful insights from diverse heart rate data and handling missing values in wearable device data remain key challenges. To address these challenges, we propose TARL, an innovative approach that models the structural relationships of representative subsequences, known as shapelets, in heart rate time series. TARL creates a shapelet-transition knowledge graph to model shapelet dynamics in heart rate time series, indicating illness progression and potential future changes. We further introduce a transition-aware knowledge embedding to reinforce relationships among shapelets and quantify the impact of missing values, enabling the formulation of comprehensive heart rate representations. These representations capture explanatory structures and predict future heart rate trends, aiding early illness detection. We collaborate with physicians and nurses to gather ICU patient heart rate data from wearables and diagnostic metrics assessing illness severity for evaluating deterioration. Experiments on real-world ICU data demonstrate that TARL achieves both high reliability and early detection. A case study further showcases TARL's explainable detection process, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven tool to assist clinicians in recognizing early signs of patient deterioration.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large multi-modal models inevitably decay over time as facts change and previously learned information becomes outdated. Traditional approaches such as fine-tuning are often impractical for updating these models due to their size and complexity. Instead, direct knowledge editing within the models presents a more viable solution. Current model editing techniques, however, typically overlook the unique influence ranges of different facts, leading to compromised model performance in terms of both generality and locality. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of the generality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. We develop a new model editing dataset named OKEDIT, specifically designed to effectively evaluate this trade-off. Building on this foundation, we propose BalancEdit, a novel method for balanced model editing that dynamically achieves an optimal balance between generality and locality. BalancEdit utilizes a unique mechanism that generates both positive and negative samples for each fact to accurately determine its influence scope and incorporates these insights into the model's latent space using a discrete, localized codebook of edits, without modifying the underlying model weights. To our knowledge, this is the first approach explicitly addressing the generality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. Our comprehensive results confirm the effectiveness of BalancEdit, demonstrating minimal trade-offs while maintaining robust editing capabilities. Our code and dataset will be available.

Abstract: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is fundamental for advanced software development, supporting faster and more efficient delivery of code changes into cloud environments. However, security issues in the CI/CD pipeline remain challenging, and incidents (e.g., DDoS, Bot, Log4j, etc.) are happening over the cloud environments. While plenty of literature discusses static security testing and CI/CD practices, only a few deal with network traffic pattern analysis to detect different cyberattacks. This research aims to enhance CI/CD pipeline security by implementing anomaly detection through AI (Artificial Intelligence) support. The goal is to identify unusual behaviour or variations from network traffic patterns in pipeline and cloud platforms. The system shall integrate into the workflow to continuously monitor pipeline activities and cloud infrastructure. Additionally, it aims to explore adaptive response mechanisms to mitigate the detected anomalies or security threats. This research employed two popular network traffic datasets, CSE-CIC-IDS2018 and CSE-CIC-IDS2017. We implemented a combination of Convolution Neural Network(CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to detect unusual traffic patterns. We achieved an accuracy of 98.69% and 98.30% and generated log files in different CI/CD pipeline stages that resemble the network anomalies affected to address security challenges in modern DevOps practices, contributing to advancing software security and reliability.

TF1-EN-3M demonstrates that large-scale moral storytelling can be achieved without the need for proprietary giant models.<br /><br />Summary: TF1-EN-3M is a groundbreaking dataset of three million English fables generated by instruction-tuned models, providing a structured scaffold for moral stories. The dataset enables research in various fields and showcases the potential for large-scale moral storytelling without relying on proprietary models. <div>
arXiv:2504.20605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moral stories are a time-tested vehicle for transmitting values, yet modern NLP lacks a large, structured corpus that couples coherent narratives with explicit ethical lessons. We close this gap with TF1-EN-3M, the first open dataset of three million English-language fables generated exclusively by instruction-tuned models no larger than 8B parameters. Each story follows a six-slot scaffold (character -> trait -> setting -> conflict -> resolution -> moral), produced through a combinatorial prompt engine that guarantees genre fidelity while covering a broad thematic space.
  A hybrid evaluation pipeline blends (i) a GPT-based critic that scores grammar, creativity, moral clarity, and template adherence with (ii) reference-free diversity and readability metrics. Among ten open-weight candidates, an 8B-parameter Llama-3 variant delivers the best quality-speed trade-off, producing high-scoring fables on a single consumer GPU (<24 GB VRAM) at approximately 13.5 cents per 1,000 fables.
  We release the dataset, generation code, evaluation scripts, and full metadata under a permissive license, enabling exact reproducibility and cost benchmarking. TF1-EN-3M opens avenues for research in instruction following, narrative intelligence, value alignment, and child-friendly educational AI, demonstrating that large-scale moral storytelling no longer requires proprietary giant models.

Abstract: Plant phenotyping plays a pivotal role in understanding plant traits and their interactions with the environment, making it crucial for advancing precision agriculture and crop improvement. 3D reconstruction technologies have emerged as powerful tools for capturing detailed plant morphology and structure, offering significant potential for accurate and automated phenotyping. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the 3D reconstruction techniques for plant phenotyping, covering classical reconstruction methods, emerging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and the novel 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) approach. Classical methods, which often rely on high-resolution sensors, are widely adopted due to their simplicity and flexibility in representing plant structures. However, they face challenges such as data density, noise, and scalability. NeRF, a recent advancement, enables high-quality, photorealistic 3D reconstructions from sparse viewpoints, but its computational cost and applicability in outdoor environments remain areas of active research. The emerging 3DGS technique introduces a new paradigm in reconstructing plant structures by representing geometry through Gaussian primitives, offering potential benefits in both efficiency and scalability. We review the methodologies, applications, and performance of these approaches in plant phenotyping and discuss their respective strengths, limitations, and future prospects (https://github.com/JiajiaLi04/3D-Reconstruction-Plants). Through this review, we aim to provide insights into how these diverse 3D reconstruction techniques can be effectively leveraged for automated and high-throughput plant phenotyping, contributing to the next generation of agricultural technology.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have broadened the scope of vision-language tasks, excelling in applications like image captioning and interactive question-answering. However, these models struggle with accurately processing visual data, particularly in tasks requiring precise object recognition and fine visual details. Stringent token limits often result in the omission of critical information, hampering performance. To address these limitations, we introduce \SysName, a novel visual prompting mechanism designed to enhance MLLM performance while preserving essential visual details within token limits. \SysName features three key innovations: a prompt-aware strategy that dynamically highlights relevant image regions, a spatial-preserving orchestration schema that maintains object integrity, and a budget-aware prompting method that balances global context with crucial visual details. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate that \SysName consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving up to a $26.9\%$ improvement in accuracy while significantly reducing token consumption.

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking presents significant challenges due to extreme illumination variations and viewpoint changes, which severely degrade tracking performance. Existing approaches either rely on light enhancers with high computational costs or introduce redundant domain adaptation mechanisms, failing to fully utilize the dynamic features in varying perspectives. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DARTer} (\textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}epresentation \textbf{T}racker), an end-to-end tracking framework designed for nighttime UAV scenarios. DARTer leverages a Dynamic Feature Blender (DFB) to effectively fuse multi-perspective nighttime features from static and dynamic templates, enhancing representation robustness. Meanwhile, a Dynamic Feature Activator (DFA) adaptively activates Vision Transformer layers based on extracted features, significantly improving efficiency by reducing redundant computations. Our model eliminates the need for complex multi-task loss functions, enabling a streamlined training process. Extensive experiments on multiple nighttime UAV tracking benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DARTer over state-of-the-art trackers. These results confirm that DARTer effectively balances tracking accuracy and efficiency, making it a promising solution for real-world nighttime UAV tracking applications.

Abstract: 4D radar has attracted attention in autonomous driving due to its ability to enable robust 3D object detection even under adverse weather conditions. To practically deploy such technologies, it is essential to achieve real-time processing within low-power embedded environments. Addressing this, we present the first on-chip implementation of a 4D radar-based 3D object detection model on the Hailo-8L AI accelerator. Although conventional 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures require 5D inputs, the Hailo-8L only supports 4D tensors, posing a significant challenge. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a tensor transformation method that reshapes 5D inputs into 4D formats during the compilation process, enabling direct deployment without altering the model structure. The proposed system achieves 46.47% AP_3D and 52.75% AP_BEV, maintaining comparable accuracy to GPU-based models while achieving an inference speed of 13.76 Hz. These results demonstrate the applicability of 4D radar-based perception technologies to autonomous driving systems.

Summary: <br />
The paper explores using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as evaluator agents for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. They introduce the Multimodal Text-to-Image Eval (MT2IE) framework to evaluate prompt-generation consistency and image aesthetics efficiently. MT2IE generates prompts iteratively, scoring the generated images and matching T2I performance with existing benchmarks using a fraction of prompts. The prompt-generation consistency scores from MT2IE show higher correlation with human judgment compared to previous methods. The framework produces the same relative T2I model rankings as static benchmarks but uses significantly fewer prompts for evaluation, showcasing its efficiency in evaluating T2I models. <div>

Abstract: The steady improvements of text-to-image (T2I) generative models lead to slow deprecation of automatic evaluation benchmarks that rely on static datasets, motivating researchers to seek alternative ways to evaluate the T2I progress. In this paper, we explore the potential of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as evaluator agents that interact with a T2I model, with the objective of assessing prompt-generation consistency and image aesthetics. We present Multimodal Text-to-Image Eval (MT2IE), an evaluation framework that iteratively generates prompts for evaluation, scores generated images and matches T2I evaluation of existing benchmarks with a fraction of the prompts used in existing static benchmarks. Moreover, we show that MT2IE's prompt-generation consistency scores have higher correlation with human judgment than scores previously introduced in the literature. MT2IE generates prompts that are efficient at probing T2I model performance, producing the same relative T2I model rankings as existing benchmarks while using only 1/80th the number of prompts for evaluation.

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning aims to quickly identify solutions for new tasks with minimal or no additional interaction with the environment. Generalized Policy Improvement (GPI) addresses this by combining a set of base policies to produce a new one that is at least as good -- though not necessarily optimal -- as any individual base policy. Optimality can be ensured, particularly in the linear-reward case, via techniques that compute a Convex Coverage Set (CCS). However, these are computationally expensive and do not scale to complex domains. The Option Keyboard (OK) improves upon GPI by producing policies that are at least as good -- and often better. It achieves this through a learned meta-policy that dynamically combines base policies. However, its performance critically depends on the choice of base policies. This raises a key question: is there an optimal set of base policies -- an optimal behavior basis -- that enables zero-shot identification of optimal solutions for any linear tasks? We solve this open problem by introducing a novel method that efficiently constructs such an optimal behavior basis. We show that it significantly reduces the number of base policies needed to ensure optimality in new tasks. We also prove that it is strictly more expressive than a CCS, enabling particular classes of non-linear tasks to be solved optimally. We empirically evaluate our technique in challenging domains and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, increasingly so as task complexity increases.

Summary:
The paper discusses the challenges of gradient-based bilevel optimization, which often involves computationally expensive second-order and mixed derivatives. While automatic differentiation libraries simplify the calculation process, they may not fully utilize the problem structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, the authors propose MixFlow-MG, a practical algorithm that leverages mixed-mode differentiation to improve computational efficiency in meta-learning setups. MixFlow-MG can significantly reduce memory usage and wall-clock time, offering up to 10x memory savings and 25% faster computation compared to standard implementations. By utilizing mixed-mode differentiation, MixFlow-MG constructs more efficient computational graphs, enhancing the scalability and performance of gradient-based optimisation tasks in various applications like hyperparameter optimisation, task adaptation, and algorithm discovery. <div>

Abstract: Gradient-based bilevel optimisation is a powerful technique with applications in hyperparameter optimisation, task adaptation, algorithm discovery, meta-learning more broadly, and beyond. It often requires differentiating through the gradient-based optimisation process itself, leading to "gradient-of-a-gradient" calculations with computationally expensive second-order and mixed derivatives. While modern automatic differentiation libraries provide a convenient way to write programs for calculating these derivatives, they oftentimes cannot fully exploit the specific structure of these problems out-of-the-box, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we analyse such cases and propose Mixed-Flow Meta-Gradients, or MixFlow-MG -- a practical algorithm that uses mixed-mode differentiation to construct more efficient and scalable computational graphs yielding over 10x memory and up to 25% wall-clock time improvements over standard implementations in modern meta-learning setups.

Summary:
The article explores the Edge Assembly Crossover (EAX) algorithm, a leading heuristic for solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem. It focuses on improving the algorithm's first stage, introducing a method to quickly verify the validity of generated AB-cycles. This verification is crucial before applying other crossover operators like the Generalized Partition Crossover (GPX). Through proposed enhancements to EAX, the study shows improved computational efficiency and solution quality on challenging instances. The research highlights the significance of evaluating the initial phase of heuristic algorithms like EAX, paving the way for more effective solutions in complex optimization problems. <div>
arXiv:2505.00803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Edge Assembly Crossover (EAX) algorithm is the state-of-the-art heuristic for solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). It regularly outperforms other methods, such as the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun heuristic (LKH), across diverse sets of TSP instances. Essentially, EAX employs a two-stage mechanism that focuses on improving the current solutions, first, at the local and, subsequently, at the global level. Although the second phase of the algorithm has been thoroughly studied, configured, and refined in the past, in particular, its first stage has hardly been examined.
  In this paper, we thus focus on the first stage of EAX and introduce a novel method that quickly verifies whether the AB-cycles, generated during its internal optimization procedure, yield valid tours -- or whether they need to be repaired. Knowledge of the latter is also particularly relevant before applying other powerful crossover operators such as the Generalized Partition Crossover (GPX). Based on our insights, we propose and evaluate several improved versions of EAX. According to our benchmark study across 10 000 different TSP instances, the most promising of our proposed EAX variants demonstrates improved computational efficiency and solution quality on previously rather difficult instances compared to the current state-of-the-art EAX algorithm.

<div> Keywords: Mechanistic Interpretability, Explanatory View Hypothesis, Explanatory Faithfulness, neural networks, causality

Summary: 

The article discusses Mechanistic Interpretability, which focuses on understanding neural networks through causal explanations. The Explanatory View Hypothesis posits that neural networks inherently contain explanations that can be extracted and understood. It introduces the concept of Explanatory Faithfulness as a measure of how well an explanation aligns with a model. Mechanistic Interpretability is defined as the production of model-level, ontic, causal-mechanistic, and falsifiable explanations of neural networks, setting it apart from other interpretability paradigms and highlighting its inherent limitations. The Principle of Explanatory Optimism is proposed as a crucial factor for the success of Mechanistic Interpretability. This article provides a framework for understanding and evaluating the interpretability of neural networks through causal explanations.

Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability aims to understand neural networks through causal explanations. We argue for the Explanatory View Hypothesis: that Mechanistic Interpretability research is a principled approach to understanding models because neural networks contain implicit explanations which can be extracted and understood. We hence show that Explanatory Faithfulness, an assessment of how well an explanation fits a model, is well-defined. We propose a definition of Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) as the practice of producing Model-level, Ontic, Causal-Mechanistic, and Falsifiable explanations of neural networks, allowing us to distinguish MI from other interpretability paradigms and detail MI's inherent limits. We formulate the Principle of Explanatory Optimism, a conjecture which we argue is a necessary precondition for the success of Mechanistic Interpretability.

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel two-stage noisy learning framework to address the issue of degraded generalization performance in deep neural networks under noisy supervision. The framework utilizes a dynamically weighted loss function for instance-level optimization without the need for heavy hyperparameter tuning. A new metric called wrong event is introduced to effectively model the cleanliness and difficulty of individual samples. The framework first collects wrong event information to build a strong base model and then performs noise-robust training using a probabilistic model. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques in terms of performance and computational efficiency, reducing computational time by nearly 75% and improving model scalability. <div>

Abstract: Recent studies indicate that deep neural networks degrade in generalization performance under noisy supervision. Existing methods focus on isolating clean subsets or correcting noisy labels, facing limitations such as high computational costs, heavy hyperparameter tuning process, and coarse-grained optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage noisy learning framework that enables instance-level optimization through a dynamically weighted loss function, avoiding hyperparameter tuning. To obtain stable and accurate information about noise modeling, we introduce a simple yet effective metric, termed wrong event, which dynamically models the cleanliness and difficulty of individual samples while maintaining computational costs. Our framework first collects wrong event information and builds a strong base model. Then we perform noise-robust training on the base model, using a probabilistic model to handle the wrong event information of samples. Experiments on five synthetic and real-world LNL benchmarks demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance, achieves a nearly 75% reduction in computational time and improves model scalability.

Summary: 
This study introduces Spill The Beans, a novel method that utilizes cache side-channels to leak tokens generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). By co-locating an attack process with the victim model on shared hardware, the attackers can detect cache hits when accessing embedding vectors, leaking tokens. Despite the challenge of the LLMs' size quickly evicting embedding vectors from the cache, the researchers address this by balancing the number of monitored tokens against the leaked information. Through extensive experimentation, they demonstrate the feasibility of leaking tokens from LLMs using cache side-channels, highlighting a new vulnerability in LLM deployments. The findings emphasize that even sophisticated models are susceptible to traditional side-channel attacks, with implications for privacy and security in LLM-serving infrastructures. The study suggests mitigation strategies and showcases two concrete attack scenarios, showing high recovery rates for API keys and English text, with potential for improvement in more specialized output domains. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Side-channel attacks on shared hardware resources increasingly threaten confidentiality, especially with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce Spill The Beans, a novel application of cache side-channels to leak tokens generated by an LLM. By co-locating an attack process on the same hardware as the victim model, we flush and reload embedding vectors from the embedding layer, where each token corresponds to a unique embedding vector. When accessed during token generation, it results in a cache hit detectable by our attack on shared lower-level caches.
  A significant challenge is the massive size of LLMs, which, by nature of their compute intensive operation, quickly evicts embedding vectors from the cache. We address this by balancing the number of tokens monitored against the amount of information leaked. Monitoring more tokens increases potential vocabulary leakage but raises the chance of missing cache hits due to eviction; monitoring fewer tokens improves detection reliability but limits vocabulary coverage.
  Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the feasibility of leaking tokens from LLMs via cache side-channels. Our findings reveal a new vulnerability in LLM deployments, highlighting that even sophisticated models are susceptible to traditional side-channel attacks. We discuss the implications for privacy and security in LLM-serving infrastructures and suggest considerations for mitigating such threats. For proof of concept we consider two concrete attack scenarios: Our experiments show that an attacker can recover as much as 80%-90% of a high entropy API key with single shot monitoring. As for English text we can reach a 40% recovery rate with a single shot. We should note that the rate highly depends on the monitored token set and these rates can be improved by targeting more specialized output domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, enabling their widespread adoption across various domains. However, their susceptibility to prompt injection attacks poses significant security risks, as adversarial inputs can manipulate model behavior and override intended instructions. Despite numerous defense strategies, a standardized framework to rigorously evaluate their effectiveness, especially under adaptive adversarial scenarios, is lacking. To address this gap, we introduce OET, an optimization-based evaluation toolkit that systematically benchmarks prompt injection attacks and defenses across diverse datasets using an adaptive testing framework. Our toolkit features a modular workflow that facilitates adversarial string generation, dynamic attack execution, and comprehensive result analysis, offering a unified platform for assessing adversarial robustness. Crucially, the adaptive testing framework leverages optimization methods with both white-box and black-box access to generate worst-case adversarial examples, thereby enabling strict red-teaming evaluations. Extensive experiments underscore the limitations of current defense mechanisms, with some models remaining susceptible even after implementing security enhancements.

ICQuant introduces a novel framework for outlier-aware weight-only quantization by utilizing outlier statistics to develop an efficient index coding scheme. It effectively shrinks quantization ranges with only approximately 0.3 bits overhead, thereby achieving significant savings in extreme compression scenarios. ICQuant can be applied alongside existing quantizers to enhance quantization quality. When employed with simple scalar quantizers using 2.3 bits per weight, ICQuant enhances the zero-shot accuracy of the 2-bit Llama3-70B model by up to 130% and 150% compared to QTIP and QuIP#, respectively. Furthermore, it delivers comparable performance to the top fine-tuned quantizer (PV-tuning) without requiring fine-tuning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights the need for efficient low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ), due to their high memory costs. A key challenge in weight quantization is the presence of outliers, which inflate quantization ranges and lead to large errors. While a number of outlier suppression techniques have been proposed, they either: fail to effectively shrink the quantization range, or incur (relatively) high bit overhead. In this paper, we present ICQuant, a novel framework that leverages outlier statistics to design an efficient index coding scheme for outlier-aware weight-only quantization. Compared to existing outlier suppression techniques requiring $\approx 1$ bit overhead to halve the quantization range, ICQuant requires only $\approx 0.3$ bits; a significant saving in extreme compression regimes (e.g., 2-3 bits per weight). ICQuant can be used on top of any existing quantizers to eliminate outliers, improving the quantization quality. Using just 2.3 bits per weight and simple scalar quantizers, ICQuant improves the zero-shot accuracy of the 2-bit Llama3-70B model by up to 130% and 150% relative to QTIP and QuIP#; and it achieves comparable performance to the best-known fine-tuned quantizer (PV-tuning) without fine-tuning.

<div> Keywords: Robots, Inverse Kinematics, Human-like physicality, Genetic Algorithm, Reachability map

Summary: 
Robots with human-like physicality are being developed to potentially replace human tasks, particularly in household service. However, size limitations often pose challenges in solving inverse kinematics (IK) due to joint angle constraints. This paper introduces a method to generate an optimal initial guess for numerical IK solvers based on the scaled Jacobian matrix and manipulability index, taking into account joint limits. By using a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the goodness of the initial guess, the probability of successfully solving IK is increased. Additionally, a reachability map is utilized to explore various IK solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that employing a better initial guess leads to higher IK solvability. The proposed method showcases its effectiveness by enabling a robot to achieve three distinct scenarios through optimized initial guesses. <div>
arXiv:2505.00871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots are strongly expected as a means of replacing human tasks. If a robot has a human-like physicality, the possibility of replacing human tasks increases. In the case of household service robots, it is desirable for them to be on a human-like size so that they do not become excessively large in order to coexist with humans in their operating environment. However, robots with size limitations tend to have difficulty solving inverse kinematics (IK) due to mechanical limitations, such as joint angle limitations. Conversely, if the difficulty coming from this limitation could be mitigated, one can expect that the use of such robots becomes more valuable. In numerical IK solver, which is commonly used for robots with higher degrees-of-freedom (DOF), the solvability of IK depends on the initial guess given to the solver. Thus, this paper proposes a method for generating a good initial guess for a numerical IK solver given the target hand configuration. For the purpose, we define the goodness of an initial guess using the scaled Jacobian matrix, which can calculate the manipulability index considering the joint limits. These two factors are related to the difficulty of solving IK. We generate the initial guess by optimizing the goodness using the genetic algorithm (GA). To enumerate much possible IK solutions, we use the reachability map that represents the reachable area of the robot hand in the arm-base coordinate system. We conduct quantitative evaluation and prove that using an initial guess that is judged to be better using the goodness value increases the probability that IK is solved. Finally, as an application of the proposed method, we show that by generating good initial guesses for IK a robot actually achieves three typical scenarios.

Summary:<br />
This work introduces a novel approach using large language models to accurately model user preferences in recommender systems. By generating natural language summaries of users' interaction histories, the framework captures both short-term and long-term preferences. The use of pre-trained models and attention mechanisms enables a comprehensive user representation that improves recommendation accuracy. Furthermore, the approach supports explainability by providing interpretable text summaries and attention weights to users. Real-world experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in enhancing recommendation performance and generating transparent justifications for content-based recommendations. The incorporation of temporal modeling and natural language processing offers a promising avenue for advancing user profiling in recommender systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurately modeling user preferences is vital not only for improving recommendation performance but also for enhancing transparency in recommender systems. Conventional user profiling methods, such as averaging item embeddings, often overlook the evolving, nuanced nature of user interests, particularly the interplay between short-term and long-term preferences. In this work, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language summaries of users' interaction histories, distinguishing recent behaviors from more persistent tendencies. Our framework not only models temporal user preferences but also produces natural language profiles that can be used to explain recommendations in an interpretable manner. These textual profiles are encoded via a pre-trained model, and an attention mechanism dynamically fuses the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user representation. Beyond boosting recommendation accuracy over multiple baselines, our approach naturally supports explainability: the interpretable text summaries and attention weights can be exposed to end users, offering insights into why specific items are suggested. Experiments on real-world datasets underscore both the performance gains and the promise of generating clearer, more transparent justifications for content-based recommendations.

Summary:
The paper introduces Learnable Transformation-based Generalized Time Encoding (LeTE) as a method to effectively model diverse and complex time patterns in real-world scenarios. By utilizing deep function learning techniques to parameterize non-linear transformations in time encoding, LeTE allows for the modeling of generalized time patterns. This approach improves upon existing time encoding methods by making the transformations learnable and adaptable to various temporal dynamics. LeTE encompasses previous methods as specific cases and can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of tasks. Experimental results across diverse domains demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of LeTE in capturing and encoding time information for applications involving chronologically occurring events. <div>
arXiv:2505.00887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effectively modeling time information and incorporating it into applications or models involving chronologically occurring events is crucial. Real-world scenarios often involve diverse and complex time patterns, which pose significant challenges for time encoding methods. While previous methods focus on capturing time patterns, many rely on specific inductive biases, such as using trigonometric functions to model periodicity. This narrow focus on single-pattern modeling makes them less effective in handling the diversity and complexities of real-world time patterns. In this paper, we investigate to improve the existing commonly used time encoding methods and introduce Learnable Transformation-based Generalized Time Encoding (LeTE). We propose using deep function learning techniques to parameterize non-linear transformations in time encoding, making them learnable and capable of modeling generalized time patterns, including diverse and complex temporal dynamics. By enabling learnable transformations, LeTE encompasses previous methods as specific cases and allows seamless integration into a wide range of tasks. Through extensive experiments across diverse domains, we demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of LeTE.

Summary: 
The paper addresses the challenge of fine-tuning policies learned offline, which often results in performance degradation during the initial stages. Existing algorithms either exhibit performance degradation or slow learning during fine-tuning. The proposed algorithm, based on Jump Start, gradually increases exploration based on online performance estimates to achieve fast and effective fine-tuning. By doing so, it reduces performance degradation compared to current algorithms. This approach aims to improve the efficiency of fine-tuning learned networks online, providing a more stable and effective method for policy improvement. <div>

Abstract: Fine-tuning policies learned offline remains a major challenge in application domains. Monotonic performance improvement during \emph{fine-tuning} is often challenging, as agents typically experience performance degradation at the early fine-tuning stage. The community has identified multiple difficulties in fine-tuning a learned network online, however, the majority of progress has focused on improving learning efficiency during fine-tuning. In practice, this comes at a serious cost during fine-tuning: initially, agent performance degrades as the agent explores and effectively overrides the policy learned offline. We show across a range of settings, many offline-to-online algorithms exhibit either (1) performance degradation or (2) slow learning (sometimes effectively no improvement) during fine-tuning. We introduce a new fine-tuning algorithm, based on an algorithm called Jump Start, that gradually allows more exploration based on online estimates of performance. Empirically, this approach achieves fast fine-tuning and significantly reduces performance degradations compared with existing algorithms designed to do the same.

Summary:<br />
Conformal Selection (CS) is a method used in applications like drug discovery and language models for selecting high-quality candidates from large datasets. However, it is limited to univariate responses. To address this limitation, Multivariate Conformal Selection (mCS) is proposed as a generalization of CS for multivariate response settings. mCS introduces regional monotonicity and utilizes multivariate nonconformity scores to construct conformal p-values, ensuring finite-sample False Discovery Rate (FDR) control. Two variants of mCS are presented: mCS-dist, using distance-based scores, and mCS-learn, which optimizes scores through differentiable optimization. Experimental results on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the improved selection power of mCS while maintaining FDR control, establishing it as a robust framework for multivariate selection tasks.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large datasets is critical in applications such as drug discovery, precision medicine, and alignment of large language models (LLMs). While Conformal Selection (CS) provides rigorous uncertainty quantification, it is limited to univariate responses and scalar criteria. To address this issue, we propose Multivariate Conformal Selection (mCS), a generalization of CS designed for multivariate response settings. Our method introduces regional monotonicity and employs multivariate nonconformity scores to construct conformal p-values, enabling finite-sample False Discovery Rate (FDR) control. We present two variants: mCS-dist, using distance-based scores, and mCS-learn, which learns optimal scores via differentiable optimization. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that mCS significantly improves selection power while maintaining FDR control, establishing it as a robust framework for multivariate selection tasks.

Summary: 
The article discusses the growing importance of IoT devices in various applications and the task of sensing and transmitting information in IoT networks. Traditional routing protocols optimize static objectives, but real-world IoT applications require adapting to dynamic priorities. To address this, the authors propose a dynamic and distributed routing approach based on multiobjective Q-learning, which can adjust to changing preferences in real-time. They introduce a greedy interpolation policy scheme to make near-optimal decisions for unexpected preference changes. By utilizing Pareto-efficient solutions for dynamic preferences, the proposed scheme outperforms existing algorithms in terms of overall reward, energy efficiency, and packet delivery ratio. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in adapting to different exploration strategies and preference variations. <div>

Abstract: The last few decades have witnessed a rapid increase in IoT devices owing to their wide range of applications, such as smart healthcare monitoring systems, smart cities, and environmental monitoring. A critical task in IoT networks is sensing and transmitting information over the network. The IoT nodes gather data by sensing the environment and then transmit this data to a destination node via multi-hop communication, following some routing protocols. These protocols are usually designed to optimize possibly contradictory objectives, such as maximizing packet delivery ratio and energy efficiency. While most literature has focused on optimizing a static objective that remains unchanged, many real-world IoT applications require adapting to rapidly shifting priorities. For example, in monitoring systems, some transmissions are time-critical and require a high priority on low latency, while other transmissions are less urgent and instead prioritize energy efficiency. To meet such dynamic demands, we propose novel dynamic and distributed routing based on multiobjective Q-learning that can adapt to changes in preferences in real-time. Our algorithm builds on ideas from both multi-objective optimization and Q-learning. We also propose a novel greedy interpolation policy scheme to take near-optimal decisions for unexpected preference changes. The proposed scheme can approximate and utilize the Pareto-efficient solutions for dynamic preferences, thus utilizing past knowledge to adapt to unpredictable preferences quickly during runtime. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for various exploration strategies, preference variation patterns, and important metrics like overall reward, energy efficiency, and packet delivery ratio.

Abstract: This study investigates the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to scale-up Dynamic Assessment (DA). To facilitate such an investigation, we first developed DynaWrite-a modular, microservices-based grammatical tutoring application which supports multiple LLMs to generate dynamic feedback to learners of English. Initial testing of 21 LLMs, revealed GPT-4o and neural chat to have the most potential to scale-up DA in the language learning classroom. Further testing of these two candidates found both models performed similarly in their ability to accurately identify grammatical errors in user sentences. However, GPT-4o consistently outperformed neural chat in the quality of its DA by generating clear, consistent, and progressively explicit hints. Real-time responsiveness and system stability were also confirmed through detailed performance testing, with GPT-4o exhibiting sufficient speed and stability. This study shows that LLMs can be used to scale-up dynamic assessment and thus enable dynamic assessment to be delivered to larger groups than possible in traditional teacher-learner settings.

<div> Keywords: bike-sharing systems, self-supervised Transformer, fault detection, spatiotemporal features, shared mobility<br />
Summary:
The paper introduces a novel Self-Supervised Transformer (SSTransformer) framework for detecting faulty shared bikes in bike-sharing systems. The framework leverages spatiotemporal features extracted from GPS trajectories and trip records to automate the identification of unusable bikes. Through self-supervised pre-training, the Transformer encoder learns generalized representations of bike movement before adapting to a downstream binary classification task. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset of 10,730 bikes from Chengdu, China show that SSTransformer outperforms traditional machine learning models, ensemble learning, and deep learning baselines, achieving high accuracy (97.81%), precision (0.8889), and F1-score (0.9358).

Abstract: The rapid expansion of bike-sharing systems (BSS) has greatly improved urban "last-mile" connectivity, yet large-scale deployments face escalating operational challenges, particularly in detecting faulty bikes. Existing detection approaches either rely on static model-based thresholds that overlook dynamic spatiotemporal (ST) usage patterns or employ supervised learning methods that struggle with label scarcity and class imbalance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Self-Supervised Transformer (SSTransformer) framework for automatically detecting unusable shared bikes, leveraging ST features extracted from GPS trajectories and trip records. The model incorporates a self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance its feature extraction capabilities, followed by fine-tuning for efficient status recognition. In the pre-training phase, the Transformer encoder learns generalized representations of bike movement via a self-supervised objective; in the fine-tuning phase, the encoder is adapted to a downstream binary classification task. Comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset of 10,730 bikes (1,870 unusable, 8,860 normal) from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SSTransformer significantly outperforms traditional machine learning, ensemble learning, and deep learning baselines, achieving the best accuracy (97.81%), precision (0.8889), and F1-score (0.9358). This work highlights the effectiveness of self-supervised Transformer on ST data for capturing complex anomalies in BSS, paving the way toward more reliable and scalable maintenance solutions for shared mobility.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot object detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects across different domains with limited class instances. Feature confusion, including object-background confusion and object-object confusion, presents significant challenges in both cross-domain and few-shot settings. In this work, we introduce CDFormer, a cross-domain few-shot object detection transformer against feature confusion, to address these challenges. The method specifically tackles feature confusion through two key modules: object-background distinguishing (OBD) and object-object distinguishing (OOD). The OBD module leverages a learnable background token to differentiate between objects and background, while the OOD module enhances the distinction between objects of different classes. Experimental results demonstrate that CDFormer outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 12.9% mAP, 11.0% mAP, and 10.4% mAP improvements under the 1/5/10 shot settings, respectively, when fine-tuned.

Abstract: Tree-Sliced methods have recently emerged as an alternative to the traditional Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance, replacing one-dimensional lines with tree-based metric spaces and incorporating a splitting mechanism for projecting measures. This approach enhances the ability to capture the topological structures of integration domains in Sliced Optimal Transport while maintaining low computational costs. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel nonlinear projectional framework for the Tree-Sliced Wasserstein (TSW) distance, substituting the linear projections in earlier versions with general projections, while ensuring the injectivity of the associated Radon Transform and preserving the well-definedness of the resulting metric. By designing appropriate projections, we construct efficient metrics for measures on both Euclidean spaces and spheres. Finally, we validate our proposed metric through extensive numerical experiments for Euclidean and spherical datasets. Applications include gradient flows, self-supervised learning, and generative models, where our methods demonstrate significant improvements over recent SW and TSW variants.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success but remain data-inefficient, especially when learning from small, specialized corpora with limited and proprietary data. Existing synthetic data generation methods for continue pre-training focus on intra-document content and overlook cross-document knowledge associations, limiting content diversity and depth. We propose Synthetic-on-Graph (SoG), a synthetic data generation framework that incorporates cross-document knowledge associations for efficient corpus expansion. SoG constructs a context graph by extracting entities and concepts from the original corpus, representing cross-document associations, and employing a graph walk strategy for knowledge-associated sampling. This enhances synthetic data diversity and coherence, enabling models to learn complex knowledge structures and handle rare knowledge. To further improve synthetic data quality, we integrate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Contrastive Clarifying (CC) synthetic, enhancing reasoning processes and discriminative power. Experiments show that SoG outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method in a multi-hop document Q&amp;A dataset while performing comparably to the SOTA method on the reading comprehension task datasets, which also underscores the better generalization capability of SoG. Our work advances synthetic data generation and provides practical solutions for efficient knowledge acquisition in LLMs, especially in domains with limited data availability.

<div> Keywords: directed graph neural networks, knowledge distillation, hierarchical encoding theory, data-centric learning, topology

Summary:
EDEN introduces a novel data-centric approach for learning from directed graphs, addressing the limitations of existing DiGraph Neural Networks (DiGNNs). By leveraging hierarchical knowledge trees and mutual information of node profiles, EDEN enhances knowledge flow and improves model-level predictive performance. The proposed method can be used as a standalone digraph learning paradigm or as a model-agnostic data-centric Knowledge Distillation module. EDEN's hierarchical encoding theory for structured data enables it to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various graph datasets and downstream tasks, surpassing existing (Di)GNN models. The framework can also be extended to undirected scenarios and demonstrates strong improvement over prevalent graph neural networks. Overall, EDEN provides a comprehensive solution for exploring the correlations between directed edges and node profiles in digraphs, leading to more robust and accurate predictive models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The directed graph (digraph), as a generalization of undirected graphs, exhibits superior representation capability in modeling complex topology systems and has garnered considerable attention in recent years. Despite the notable efforts made by existing DiGraph Neural Networks (DiGNNs) to leverage directed edges, they still fail to comprehensively delve into the abundant data knowledge concealed in the digraphs. This data-level limitation results in model-level sub-optimal predictive performance and underscores the necessity of further exploring the potential correlations between the directed edges (topology) and node profiles (feature and labels) from a data-centric perspective, thereby empowering model-centric neural networks with stronger encoding capabilities.
  In this paper, we propose \textbf{E}ntropy-driven \textbf{D}igraph knowl\textbf{E}dge distillatio\textbf{N} (EDEN), which can serve as a data-centric digraph learning paradigm or a model-agnostic hot-and-plug data-centric Knowledge Distillation (KD) module. The core idea is to achieve data-centric ML, guided by our proposed hierarchical encoding theory for structured data. Specifically, EDEN first utilizes directed structural measurements from a topology perspective to construct a coarse-grained Hierarchical Knowledge Tree (HKT). Subsequently, EDEN quantifies the mutual information of node profiles to refine knowledge flow in the HKT, enabling data-centric KD supervision within model training. As a general framework, EDEN can also naturally extend to undirected scenarios and demonstrate satisfactory performance. In our experiments, EDEN has been widely evaluated on 14 (di)graph datasets (homophily and heterophily) and across 4 downstream tasks. The results demonstrate that EDEN attains SOTA performance and exhibits strong improvement for prevalent (Di)GNNs.

This paper introduces a novel watermarking technique for embedding ownership information into a deep neural network (DNN) that remains robust during fine-tuning. The method leverages a revised Fourier transform to extract specific frequency components from the convolutional filter, ensuring that they remain unchanged during gradient descent. These frequency components are shown to be invariant to weight scaling and permutations, allowing for the design of a watermark module to encode information into them. Preliminary experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in embedding watermarks into DNNs.

Abstract: This paper proves a new watermarking method to embed the ownership information into a deep neural network (DNN), which is robust to fine-tuning. Specifically, we prove that when the input feature of a convolutional layer only contains low-frequency components, specific frequency components of the convolutional filter will not be changed by gradient descent during the fine-tuning process, where we propose a revised Fourier transform to extract frequency components from the convolutional filter. Additionally, we also prove that these frequency components are equivariant to weight scaling and weight permutations. In this way, we design a watermark module to encode the watermark information to specific frequency components in a convolutional filter. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: The importance of benchmarks for assessing the values of language models has been pronounced due to the growing need of more authentic, human-aligned responses. However, existing benchmarks rely on human or machine annotations that are vulnerable to value-related biases. Furthermore, the tested scenarios often diverge from real-world contexts in which models are commonly used to generate text and express values. To address these issues, we propose the Value Portrait benchmark, a reliable framework for evaluating LLMs' value orientations with two key characteristics. First, the benchmark consists of items that capture real-life user-LLM interactions, enhancing the relevance of assessment results to real-world LLM usage and thus ecological validity. Second, each item is rated by human subjects based on its similarity to their own thoughts, and correlations between these ratings and the subjects' actual value scores are derived. This psychometrically validated approach ensures that items strongly correlated with specific values serve as reliable items for assessing those values. Through evaluating 27 LLMs with our benchmark, we find that these models prioritize Benevolence, Security, and Self-Direction values while placing less emphasis on Tradition, Power, and Achievement values. Also, our analysis reveals biases in how LLMs perceive various demographic groups, deviating from real human data.

<title>Fine-Tuning Without Forgetting: Adaptation of YOLOv8 Preserves COCO Performance</title>

Abstract: The success of large pre-trained object detectors hinges on their adaptability to diverse downstream tasks. While fine-tuning is the standard adaptation method, specializing these models for challenging fine-grained domains necessitates careful consideration of feature granularity. The critical question remains: how deeply should the pre-trained backbone be fine-tuned to optimize for the specialized task without incurring catastrophic forgetting of the original general capabilities? Addressing this, we present a systematic empirical study evaluating the impact of fine-tuning depth. We adapt a standard YOLOv8n model to a custom, fine-grained fruit detection dataset by progressively unfreezing backbone layers (freeze points at layers 22, 15, and 10) and training. Performance was rigorously evaluated on both the target fruit dataset and, using a dual-head evaluation architecture, on the original COCO validation set. Our results demonstrate unequivocally that deeper fine-tuning (unfreezing down to layer 10) yields substantial performance gains (e.g., +10\% absolute mAP50) on the fine-grained fruit task compared to only training the head. Strikingly, this significant adaptation and specialization resulted in negligible performance degradation (<0.1\% absolute mAP difference) on the COCO benchmark across all tested freeze levels. We conclude that adapting mid-to-late backbone features is highly effective for fine-grained specialization. Critically, our results demonstrate this adaptation can be achieved without the commonly expected penalty of catastrophic forgetting, presenting a compelling case for exploring deeper fine-tuning strategies, particularly when targeting complex domains or when maximizing specialized performance is paramount.

<title>Stagnation in Evolutionary Algorithms: Convergence $\neq$ Optimality</title>

Abstract: In the evolutionary computation community, it is widely believed that stagnation impedes convergence in evolutionary algorithms, and that convergence inherently indicates optimality. However, this perspective is misleading. In this study, it is the first to highlight that the stagnation of an individual can actually facilitate the convergence of the entire population, and convergence does not necessarily imply optimality, not even local optimality. Convergence alone is insufficient to ensure the effectiveness of evolutionary algorithms. Several counterexamples are provided to illustrate this argument.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various domains. However, the substantial hardware resources required for their training present a significant barrier to efficiency and scalability. To mitigate this challenge, low-precision training techniques have been widely adopted, leading to notable advancements in training efficiency. Despite these gains, low-precision training involves several components$\unicode{x2013}$such as weights, activations, and gradients$\unicode{x2013}$each of which can be represented in different numerical formats. The resulting diversity has created a fragmented landscape in low-precision training research, making it difficult for researchers to gain a unified overview of the field. This survey provides a comprehensive review of existing low-precision training methods. To systematically organize these approaches, we categorize them into three primary groups based on their underlying numerical formats, which is a key factor influencing hardware compatibility, computational efficiency, and ease of reference for readers. The categories are: (1) fixed-point and integer-based methods, (2) floating-point-based methods, and (3) customized format-based methods. Additionally, we discuss quantization-aware training approaches, which share key similarities with low-precision training during forward propagation. Finally, we highlight several promising research directions to advance this field. A collection of papers discussed in this survey is provided in https://github.com/Hao840/Awesome-Low-Precision-Training.

Abstract: Sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) offers strong performance in nonlinear and contact-rich robotic tasks, yet often suffers from poor exploration due to locally greedy sampling schemes. We propose \emph{Model Tensor Planning} (MTP), a novel sampling-based MPC framework that introduces high-entropy control trajectory generation through structured tensor sampling. By sampling over randomized multipartite graphs and interpolating control trajectories with B-splines and Akima splines, MTP ensures smooth and globally diverse control candidates. We further propose a simple $\beta$-mixing strategy that blends local exploitative and global exploratory samples within the modified Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) update, balancing control refinement and exploration. Theoretically, we show that MTP achieves asymptotic path coverage and maximum entropy in the control trajectory space in the limit of infinite tensor depth and width.
  Our implementation is fully vectorized using JAX and compatible with MuJoCo XLA, supporting \emph{Just-in-time} (JIT) compilation and batched rollouts for real-time control with online domain randomization. Through experiments on various challenging robotic tasks, ranging from dexterous in-hand manipulation to humanoid locomotion, we demonstrate that MTP outperforms standard MPC and evolutionary strategy baselines in task success and control robustness. Design and sensitivity ablations confirm the effectiveness of MTP tensor sampling structure, spline interpolation choices, and mixing strategy. Altogether, MTP offers a scalable framework for robust exploration in model-based planning and control.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks, raising concerns about their potential for automated exploit generation (AEG). This paper presents the first systematic study on LLMs' effectiveness in AEG, evaluating both their cooperativeness and technical proficiency. To mitigate dataset bias, we introduce a benchmark with refactored versions of five software security labs. Additionally, we design an LLM-based attacker to systematically prompt LLMs for exploit generation. Our experiments reveal that GPT-4 and GPT-4o exhibit high cooperativeness, comparable to uncensored models, while Llama3 is the most resistant. However, no model successfully generates exploits for refactored labs, though GPT-4o's minimal errors highlight the potential for LLM-driven AEG advancements.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred the development of diverse AI applications from code generation and video editing to text generation; however, AI supply chains such as Hugging Face, which host pretrained models and their associated configuration files contributed by the public, face significant security challenges; in particular, configuration files originally intended to set up models by specifying parameters and initial settings can be exploited to execute unauthorized code, yet research has largely overlooked their security compared to that of the models themselves; in this work, we present the first comprehensive study of malicious configurations on Hugging Face, identifying three attack scenarios (file, website, and repository operations) that expose inherent risks; to address these threats, we introduce CONFIGSCAN, an LLM-based tool that analyzes configuration files in the context of their associated runtime code and critical libraries, effectively detecting suspicious elements with low false positive rates and high accuracy; our extensive evaluation uncovers thousands of suspicious repositories and configuration files, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced security validation in AI model hosting platforms.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is a rapidly developing field that integrates multimodal information to recognize sentiments, and existing models have made significant progress in this area. The central challenge in MSA is multimodal fusion, which is predominantly addressed by Multimodal Transformers (MulTs). Although act as the paradigm, MulTs suffer from efficiency concerns. In this work, from the perspective of efficiency optimization, we propose and prove that MulTs are hierarchical modal-wise heterogeneous graphs (HMHGs), and we introduce the graph-structured representation pattern of MulTs. Based on this pattern, we propose an Interlaced Mask (IM) mechanism to design the Graph-Structured and Interlaced-Masked Multimodal Transformer (GsiT). It is formally equivalent to MulTs which achieves an efficient weight-sharing mechanism without information disorder through IM, enabling All-Modal-In-One fusion with only 1/3 of the parameters of pure MulTs. A Triton kernel called Decomposition is implemented to ensure avoiding additional computational overhead. Moreover, it achieves significantly higher performance than traditional MulTs. To further validate the effectiveness of GsiT itself and the HMHG concept, we integrate them into multiple state-of-the-art models and demonstrate notable performance improvements and parameter reduction on widely used MSA datasets.

<title>Improving Group Fairness in Knowledge Distillation via Laplace Approximation of Early Exits</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01070</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.01070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has become a powerful tool for training compact student models using larger, pretrained teacher models, often requiring less data and computational resources. Teacher models typically possess more layers and thus exhibit richer feature representations compared to their student counterparts. Furthermore, student models tend to learn simpler, surface-level features in their early layers. This discrepancy can increase errors in groups where labels spuriously correlate with specific input attributes, leading to a decline in group fairness even when overall accuracy remains comparable to the teacher. To mitigate these challenges, Early-Exit Neural Networks (EENNs), which enable predictions at multiple intermediate layers, have been employed. Confidence margins derived from these early exits have been utilized to reweight both cross-entropy and distillation losses on a per-instance basis. In this paper, we propose that leveraging Laplace approximation-based methods to obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates can also effectively reweight challenging instances and improve group fairness. We hypothesize that Laplace approximation offers a more robust identification of difficult or ambiguous instances compared to margin-based approaches. To validate our claims, we benchmark our approach using a Bert-based model on the MultiNLI dataset.

Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in public administration is expanding rapidly, moving from automating routine tasks to deploying generative and agentic systems that autonomously act on goals. While AI promises greater efficiency and responsiveness, its integration into government functions raises concerns about fairness, transparency, and accountability. This article applies principal-agent theory (PAT) to conceptualize AI adoption as a special case of delegation, highlighting three core tensions: assessability (can decisions be understood?), dependency (can the delegation be reversed?), and contestability (can decisions be challenged?). These structural challenges may lead to a "failure-by-success" dynamic, where early functional gains obscure long-term risks to democratic legitimacy. To test this framework, we conducted a pre-registered factorial survey experiment across tax, welfare, and law enforcement domains. Our findings show that although efficiency gains initially bolster trust, they simultaneously reduce citizens' perceived control. When the structural risks come to the foreground, institutional trust and perceived control both drop sharply, suggesting that hidden costs of AI adoption significantly shape public attitudes. The study demonstrates that PAT offers a powerful lens for understanding the institutional and political implications of AI in government, emphasizing the need for policymakers to address delegation risks transparently to maintain public trust.

Abstract: Generative models have revolutionized Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in multimodal applications. However, adapting these models to the medical domain poses unique challenges due to the complexity of medical data and the stringent need for clinical accuracy. In this work, we introduce a framework specifically designed for multimodal medical data generation. By enabling the generation of multi-view chest X-rays and their associated clinical report, it bridges the gap between general-purpose vision-language models and the specialized requirements of healthcare. Leveraging the MIMIC-CXR dataset, the proposed framework shows superior performance in generating high-fidelity images and semantically coherent reports. Our quantitative evaluation reveals significant results in terms of FID and BLEU scores, showcasing the quality of the generated data. Notably, our framework achieves comparable or even superior performance compared to real data on downstream disease classification tasks, underlining its potential as a tool for medical research and diagnostics. This study highlights the importance of domain-specific adaptations in enhancing the relevance and utility of generative models for clinical applications, paving the way for future advancements in synthetic multimodal medical data generation.

Abstract: Many real-world problems (e.g., resource management, autonomous driving, drug discovery) require optimizing multiple, conflicting objectives. Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) extends classic reinforcement learning to handle multiple objectives simultaneously, yielding a set of policies that capture various trade-offs. However, the MORL field lacks complex, realistic environments and benchmarks. We introduce a water resource (Nile river basin) management case study and model it as a MORL environment. We then benchmark existing MORL algorithms on this task. Our results show that specialized water management methods outperform state-of-the-art MORL approaches, underscoring the scalability challenges MORL algorithms face in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has emerged as the best solution for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. It consists of dividing each slide into patches, which are treated as a bag of instances labeled with a global label. MIL includes two main approaches: instance-based and embedding-based. In the former, each patch is classified independently, and then the patch scores are aggregated to predict the bag label. In the latter, bag classification is performed after aggregating patch embeddings. Even if instance-based methods are naturally more interpretable, embedding-based MILs have usually been preferred in the past due to their robustness to poor feature extractors. However, recently, the quality of feature embeddings has drastically increased using self-supervised learning (SSL). Nevertheless, many authors continue to endorse the superiority of embedding-based MIL. To investigate this further, we conduct 710 experiments across 4 datasets, comparing 10 MIL strategies, 6 self-supervised methods with 4 backbones, 4 foundation models, and various pathology-adapted techniques. Furthermore, we introduce 4 instance-based MIL methods never used before in the pathology domain. Through these extensive experiments, we show that with a good SSL feature extractor, simple instance-based MILs, with very few parameters, obtain similar or better performance than complex, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding-based MIL methods, setting new SOTA results on the BRACS and Camelyon16 datasets. Since simple instance-based MIL methods are naturally more interpretable and explainable to clinicians, our results suggest that more effort should be put into well-adapted SSL methods for WSI rather than into complex embedding-based MIL methods.

Abstract: Learning models capable of providing reliable predictions in the face of adversarial actions has become a central focus of the machine learning community in recent years. This challenge arises from observing that data encountered at deployment time often deviate from the conditions under which the model was trained. In this paper, we address deployment-time adversarial actions and propose a versatile, well-principled framework to evaluate the model's robustness against attacks of diverse types and intensities. While we initially focus on Support Vector Regression (SVR), the proposed approach extends naturally to the broad domain of learning via relaxed optimization techniques. Our results enable an assessment of the model vulnerability without requiring additional test data and operate in a distribution-free setup. These results not only provide a tool to enhance trust in the model's applicability but also aid in selecting among competing alternatives. Later in the paper, we show that our findings also offer useful insights for establishing new results within the out-of-distribution framework.

Abstract: Steering vectors are a promising approach to aligning language model behavior at inference time. In this paper, we propose a framework to assess the limitations of steering vectors as alignment mechanisms. Using a framework of transformer hook interventions and antonym-based function vectors, we evaluate the role of prompt structure and context complexity in steering effectiveness. Our findings indicate that steering vectors are promising for specific alignment tasks, such as value alignment, but may not provide a robust foundation for general-purpose alignment in LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. We establish a methodological foundation for future investigations into steering capabilities of reasoning models.

Abstract: The development of model ensemble attacks has significantly improved the transferability of adversarial examples, but this progress also poses severe threats to the security of deep neural networks. Existing methods, however, face two critical challenges: insufficient capture of shared gradient directions across models and a lack of adaptive weight allocation mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose a novel method Harmonized Ensemble for Adversarial Transferability (HEAT), which introduces domain generalization into adversarial example generation for the first time. HEAT consists of two key modules: Consensus Gradient Direction Synthesizer, which uses Singular Value Decomposition to synthesize shared gradient directions; and Dual-Harmony Weight Orchestrator which dynamically balances intra-domain coherence, stabilizing gradients within individual models, and inter-domain diversity, enhancing transferability across models. Experimental results demonstrate that HEAT significantly outperforms existing methods across various datasets and settings, offering a new perspective and direction for adversarial attack research.

Abstract: A flow matching model learns a time-dependent vector field $v_t(x)$ that generates a probability path $\{ p_t \}_{0 \leq t \leq 1}$ that interpolates between a well-known noise distribution ($p_0$) and the data distribution ($p_1$). It can be distilled into a \emph{two-timed flow model} (TTFM) $\phi_{s,x}(t)$ that can transform a sample belonging to the distribution at an initial time $s$ to another belonging to the distribution at a terminal time $t$ in one function evaluation. We present a new loss function for TTFM distillation called the \emph{initial/terminal velocity matching} (ITVM) loss that extends the Lagrangian Flow Map Distillation (LFMD) loss proposed by Boffi et al. by adding redundant terms to match the initial velocities at time $s$, removing the derivative from the terminal velocity term at time $t$, and using a version of the model under training, stabilized by exponential moving averaging (EMA), to compute the target terminal average velocity. Preliminary experiments show that our loss leads to better few-step generation performance on multiple types of datasets and model architectures over baselines.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, it is critical to assess the security threats and vulnerabilities that may arise both during their training phase and after models have been deployed. This survey seeks to define and categorize the various attacks targeting LLMs, distinguishing between those that occur during the training phase and those that affect already trained models. A thorough analysis of these attacks is presented, alongside an exploration of defense mechanisms designed to mitigate such threats. Defenses are classified into two primary categories: prevention-based and detection-based defenses. Furthermore, our survey summarizes possible attacks and their corresponding defense strategies. It also provides an evaluation of the effectiveness of the known defense mechanisms for the different security threats. Our survey aims to offer a structured framework for securing LLMs, while also identifying areas that require further research to improve and strengthen defenses against emerging security challenges.

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation has recently garnered significant research interest, primarily focusing on generating human motion sequences in blank backgrounds. However, human motions commonly occur within diverse 3D scenes, which has prompted exploration into scene-aware text-to-motion generation methods. Yet, existing scene-aware methods often rely on large-scale ground-truth motion sequences in diverse 3D scenes, which poses practical challenges due to the expensive cost. To mitigate this challenge, we are the first to propose a \textbf{T}raining-free \textbf{S}cene-aware \textbf{T}ext-to-\textbf{Motion} framework, dubbed as \textbf{TSTMotion}, that efficiently empowers pre-trained blank-background motion generators with the scene-aware capability. Specifically, conditioned on the given 3D scene and text description, we adopt foundation models together to reason, predict and validate a scene-aware motion guidance. Then, the motion guidance is incorporated into the blank-background motion generators with two modifications, resulting in scene-aware text-driven motion sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our proposed framework. We release our code in \href{https://tstmotion.github.io/}{Project Page}.

Abstract: LoRaWAN technology's extensive coverage positions it as a strong contender for large-scale IoT deployments. However, achieving sub-10 m accuracy in indoor localization remains challenging due to complex environmental conditions, multipath fading, and transient obstructions. This paper proposes a lightweight but robust approach combining adaptive filtering with an extended log-distance, multi-wall path loss and shadowing (PLS) model. Our methodology augments conventional models with critical LoRaWAN parameters (received signal strength indicator (RSSI), frequency, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) and dynamic environmental indicators (temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). An adaptive Kalman filter reduces RSSI fluctuations, isolating persistent trends from momentary noise. Using a six-month dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements, we evaluate three models: the baseline COST 231 multi-wall model (MWM), the baseline model augmented with environmental parameters (MWM-EP), and a forward-only adaptive Kalman-filtered RSSI version of the latter (MWM-EP-KF). Results confirm that the MWM-EP-KF achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.81 m, outperforming both the MWM-EP (10.56 m) and the baseline MWM framework (17.98 m). Environmental augmentation reduces systematic errors by 41.22%, while Kalman filtering significantly enhances robustness under high RSSI volatility by 42.63%, on average across all devices. These findings present an interpretable, efficient solution for precise indoor LoRaWAN localization in dynamically changing environments.

Abstract: Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for intelligent decision-making in vehicular networks, helping to address challenges such as limited communication resources, high vehicle mobility, and data heterogeneity. However, HFL remains vulnerable to adversarial and unreliable vehicles, whose misleading updates can significantly compromise the integrity and convergence of the global model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel defense framework that integrates dynamic vehicle selection with robust anomaly detection within a cluster-based HFL architecture, specifically designed to counter Gaussian noise and gradient ascent attacks. The framework performs a comprehensive reliability assessment for each vehicle by evaluating historical accuracy, contribution frequency, and anomaly records. Anomaly detection combines Z-score and cosine similarity analyses on model updates to identify both statistical outliers and directional deviations in model updates. To further refine detection, an adaptive thresholding mechanism is incorporated into the cosine similarity metric, dynamically adjusting the threshold based on the historical accuracy of each vehicle to enforce stricter standards for consistently high-performing vehicles. In addition, a weighted gradient averaging mechanism is implemented, which assigns higher weights to gradient updates from more trustworthy vehicles. To defend against coordinated attacks, a cross-cluster consistency check is applied to identify collaborative attacks in which multiple compromised clusters coordinate misleading updates. Together, these mechanisms form a multi-level defense strategy to filter out malicious contributions effectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces convergence time compared to benchmark methods across both 1-hop and 3-hop topologies.

<title>Gender Bias in Explainability: Investigating Performance Disparity in Post-hoc Methods</title>

Abstract: While research on applications and evaluations of explanation methods continues to expand, fairness of the explanation methods concerning disparities in their performance across subgroups remains an often overlooked aspect. In this paper, we address this gap by showing that, across three tasks and five language models, widely used post-hoc feature attribution methods exhibit significant gender disparity with respect to their faithfulness, robustness, and complexity. These disparities persist even when the models are pre-trained or fine-tuned on particularly unbiased datasets, indicating that the disparities we observe are not merely consequences of biased training data. Our results highlight the importance of addressing disparities in explanations when developing and applying explainability methods, as these can lead to biased outcomes against certain subgroups, with particularly critical implications in high-stakes contexts. Furthermore, our findings underscore the importance of incorporating the fairness of explanations, alongside overall model fairness and explainability, as a requirement in regulatory frameworks.

Abstract: As Natural Language Processing (NLP) models continue to evolve and become integral to high-stakes applications, ensuring their interpretability remains a critical challenge. Given the growing variety of explainability methods and diverse stakeholder requirements, frameworks that help stakeholders select appropriate explanations tailored to their specific use cases are increasingly important. To address this need, we introduce EvalxNLP, a Python framework for benchmarking state-of-the-art feature attribution methods for transformer-based NLP models. EvalxNLP integrates eight widely recognized explainability techniques from the Explainable AI (XAI) literature, enabling users to generate and evaluate explanations based on key properties such as faithfulness, plausibility, and complexity. Our framework also provides interactive, LLM-based textual explanations, facilitating user understanding of the generated explanations and evaluation outcomes. Human evaluation results indicate high user satisfaction with EvalxNLP, suggesting it is a promising framework for benchmarking explanation methods across diverse user groups. By offering a user-friendly and extensible platform, EvalxNLP aims at democratizing explainability tools and supporting the systematic comparison and advancement of XAI techniques in NLP.

<title>Enhancing Obsolescence Forecasting with Deep Generative Data Augmentation: A Semi-Supervised Framework for Low-Data Industrial Applications</title>

Abstract: The challenge of electronic component obsolescence is particularly critical in systems with long life cycles. Various obsolescence management methods are employed to mitigate its impact, with obsolescence forecasting being a highly sought-after and prominent approach. As a result, numerous machine learning-based forecasting methods have been proposed. However, machine learning models require a substantial amount of relevant data to achieve high precision, which is lacking in the current obsolescence landscape in some situations. This work introduces a novel framework for obsolescence forecasting based on deep learning. The proposed framework solves the lack of available data through deep generative modeling, where new obsolescence cases are generated and used to augment the training dataset. The augmented dataset is then used to train a classical machine learning-based obsolescence forecasting model. To train classical forecasting models using augmented datasets, existing classical supervised-learning classifiers are adapted for semi-supervised learning within this framework. The proposed framework demonstrates state-of-the-art results on benchmarking datasets.

Abstract: With the widespread use of LLMs, preserving privacy in user prompts has become crucial, as prompts risk exposing privacy and sensitive data to the cloud LLMs. Traditional techniques like homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, and federated learning face challenges due to heavy computational costs and user participation requirements, limiting their applicability in LLM scenarios. In this paper, we propose PromptObfus, a novel method for desensitizing LLM prompts. The core idea of PromptObfus is "anti-adversarial" learning, which perturbs privacy words in the prompt to obscure sensitive information while retaining the stability of model predictions. Specifically, PromptObfus frames prompt desensitization as a masked language modeling task, replacing privacy-sensitive terms with a [MASK] token. A desensitization model is trained to generate candidate replacements for each masked position. These candidates are subsequently selected based on gradient feedback from a surrogate model, ensuring minimal disruption to the task output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three NLP tasks. Results show that PromptObfus effectively prevents privacy inference from remote LLMs while preserving task performance.

Abstract: While data-driven methods such as neural operator have achieved great success in solving differential equations (DEs), they suffer from domain shift problems caused by different learning environments (with data bias or equation changes), which can be alleviated by transfer learning (TL). However, existing TL methods adopted in DEs problems lack either generalizability in general DEs problems or physics preservation during training. In this work, we focus on a general transfer learning method that adaptively correct the domain shift and preserve physical information. Mathematically, we characterize the data domain as product distribution and the essential problems as distribution bias and operator bias. A Physics-preserved Optimal Tensor Transport (POTT) method that simultaneously admits generalizability to common DEs and physics preservation of specific problem is proposed to adapt the data-driven model to target domain utilizing the push-forward distribution induced by the POTT map. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance, generalizability and physics preservation of the proposed POTT method.

Abstract: The capabilities of additive manufacturing have facilitated the design and production of mechanical metamaterials with diverse unit cell geometries. Establishing linkages between the vast design space of unit cells and their effective mechanical properties is critical for the efficient design and performance evaluation of such metamaterials. However, physics-based simulations of metamaterial unit cells across the entire design space are computationally expensive, necessitating a materials informatics framework to efficiently capture complex structure-property relationships. In this work, principal component analysis of 2-point correlation functions is performed to extract the salient features from a large dataset of randomly generated 2D metamaterials. Physics-based simulations are performed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based homogenization approach to efficiently compute the homogenized effective elastic stiffness across the extensive unit cell designs. Subsequently, Gaussian process regression is used to generate reduced-order surrogates, mapping unit cell designs to their homogenized effective elastic constant. It is demonstrated that the adopted workflow enables a high-value low-dimensional representation of the voluminous stochastic metamaterial dataset, facilitating the construction of robust structure-property maps. Finally, an uncertainty-based active learning framework is utilized to train a surrogate model with a significantly smaller number of data points compared to the original full dataset. It is shown that a dataset as small as $0.61\%$ of the entire dataset is sufficient to generate accurate and robust structure-property maps.

<title>2DXformer: Dual Transformers for Wind Power Forecasting with Dual Exogenous Variables</title>

Abstract: Accurate wind power forecasting can help formulate scientific dispatch plans, which is of great significance for maintaining the safety, stability, and efficient operation of the power system. In recent years, wind power forecasting methods based on deep learning have focused on extracting the spatiotemporal correlations among data, achieving significant improvements in forecasting accuracy. However, they exhibit two limitations. First, there is a lack of modeling for the inter-variable relationships, which limits the accuracy of the forecasts. Second, by treating endogenous and exogenous variables equally, it leads to unnecessary interactions between the endogenous and exogenous variables, increasing the complexity of the model. In this paper, we propose the 2DXformer, which, building upon the previous work's focus on spatiotemporal correlations, addresses the aforementioned two limitations. Specifically, we classify the inputs of the model into three types: exogenous static variables, exogenous dynamic variables, and endogenous variables. First, we embed these variables as variable tokens in a channel-independent manner. Then, we use the attention mechanism to capture the correlations among exogenous variables. Finally, we employ a multi-layer perceptron with residual connections to model the impact of exogenous variables on endogenous variables. Experimental results on two real-world large-scale datasets indicate that our proposed 2DXformer can further improve the performance of wind power forecasting. The code is available in this repository: \href{https://github.com/jseaj/2DXformer}{https://github.com/jseaj/2DXformer}.

Abstract: One of the central challenges preventing robots from acquiring complex manipulation skills is the prohibitive cost of collecting large-scale robot demonstrations. In contrast, humans are able to learn efficiently by watching others interact with their environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce semantic action flow as a core intermediate representation capturing the essential spatio-temporal manipulator-object interactions, invariant to superficial visual differences. We present ViSA-Flow, a framework that learns this representation self-supervised from unlabeled large-scale video data. First, a generative model is pre-trained on semantic action flows automatically extracted from large-scale human-object interaction video data, learning a robust prior over manipulation structure. Second, this prior is efficiently adapted to a target robot by fine-tuning on a small set of robot demonstrations processed through the same semantic abstraction pipeline. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the CALVIN benchmark and real-world tasks that ViSA-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in low-data regimes, outperforming prior methods by effectively transferring knowledge from human video observation to robotic execution. Videos are available at https://visaflow-web.github.io/ViSAFLOW.

Abstract: Safety critical software assessment requires robust assessment against complex regulatory frameworks, a process traditionally limited by manual evaluation. This paper presents Document Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (DRAFT), a novel approach that enhances the capabilities of a large language model (LLM) for safety-critical compliance assessment. DRAFT builds upon existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques by introducing a novel fine-tuning framework that accommodates our dual-retrieval architecture, which simultaneously accesses both software documentation and applicable reference standards. To fine-tune DRAFT, we develop a semi-automated dataset generation methodology that incorporates variable numbers of relevant documents with meaningful distractors, closely mirroring real-world assessment scenarios. Experiments with GPT-4o-mini demonstrate a 7% improvement in correctness over the baseline model, with qualitative improvements in evidence handling, response structure, and domain-specific reasoning. DRAFT represents a practical approach to improving compliance assessment systems while maintaining the transparency and evidence-based reasoning essential in regulatory domains.

<title>Enhancing SPARQL Query Rewriting for Complex Ontology Alignments</title>

Abstract: SPARQL query rewriting is a fundamental mechanism for uniformly querying heterogeneous ontologies in the Linked Data Web. However, the complexity of ontology alignments, particularly rich correspondences (c : c), makes this process challenging. Existing approaches primarily focus on simple (s : s) and partially complex ( s : c) alignments, thereby overlooking the challenges posed by more expressive alignments. Moreover, the intricate syntax of SPARQL presents a barrier for non-expert users seeking to fully exploit the knowledge encapsulated in ontologies. This article proposes an innovative approach for the automatic rewriting of SPARQL queries from a source ontology to a target ontology, based on a user's need expressed in natural language. It leverages the principles of equivalence transitivity as well as the advanced capabilities of large language models such as GPT-4. By integrating these elements, this approach stands out for its ability to efficiently handle complex alignments, particularly (c : c) correspondences , by fully exploiting their expressiveness. Additionally, it facilitates access to aligned ontologies for users unfamiliar with SPARQL, providing a flexible solution for querying heterogeneous data.

Abstract: The recent growth in the use of Large Language Models has made them vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial assaults, manipulative prompts, and encoded malicious inputs. Existing countermeasures frequently necessitate retraining models, which is computationally costly and impracticable for deployment. Without the need for retraining or fine-tuning, this study presents a unique defense paradigm that allows LLMs to recognize, filter, and defend against adversarial or malicious inputs on their own. There are two main parts to the suggested framework: (1) A prompt filtering module that uses sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including zero-shot classification, keyword analysis, and encoded content detection (e.g. base64, hexadecimal, URL encoding), to detect, decode, and classify harmful inputs; and (2) A summarization module that processes and summarizes adversarial research literature to give the LLM context-aware defense knowledge. This approach strengthens LLMs' resistance to adversarial exploitation by fusing text extraction, summarization, and harmful prompt analysis. According to experimental results, this integrated technique has a 98.71% success rate in identifying harmful patterns, manipulative language structures, and encoded prompts. By employing a modest amount of adversarial research literature as context, the methodology also allows the model to react correctly to harmful inputs with a larger percentage of jailbreak resistance and refusal rate. While maintaining the quality of LLM responses, the framework dramatically increases LLM's resistance to hostile misuse, demonstrating its efficacy as a quick and easy substitute for time-consuming, retraining-based defenses.

Abstract: While machine learning has significantly advanced Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), particularly within IoT environments where devices generate large volumes of data and are increasingly susceptible to cyber threats, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Our research reveals a critical flaw in existing adversarial attack methodologies: the frequent violation of domain-specific constraints, such as numerical and categorical limits, inherent to IoT and network traffic. This leads to up to 80.3% of adversarial examples being invalid, significantly overstating real-world vulnerabilities. These invalid examples, though effective in fooling models, do not represent feasible attacks within practical IoT deployments. Consequently, relying on these results can mislead resource allocation for defense, inflating the perceived susceptibility of IoT-enabled NIDS models to adversarial manipulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simpler surrogate models like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) generate more valid adversarial examples compared to complex architectures such as CNNs and LSTMs. Using the MLP as a surrogate, we analyze the transferability of adversarial severity to other ML/DL models commonly used in IoT contexts. This work underscores the importance of considering both domain constraints and model architecture when evaluating and designing robust ML/DL models for security-critical IoT and network applications.

Abstract: The efficient computation of parametric solution sensitivities is a key challenge in the integration of learning-enhanced methods with nonlinear model predictive control (MPC), as their availability is crucial for many learning algorithms. While approaches presented in the machine learning community are limited to convex or unconstrained formulations, this paper discusses the computation of solution sensitivities of general nonlinear programs (NLPs) using the implicit function theorem (IFT) and smoothed optimality conditions treated in interior-point methods (IPM). We detail sensitivity computation within a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method which employs an IPM for the quadratic subproblems. The publication is accompanied by an efficient open-source implementation within the framework, providing both forward and adjoint sensitivities for general optimal control problems, achieving speedups exceeding 3x over the state-of-the-art solver mpc.pytorch.

Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to understand neural networks through causal explanations. Though MI has many explanation-generating methods, progress has been limited by the lack of a universal approach to evaluating explanations. Here we analyse the fundamental question "What makes a good explanation?" We introduce a pluralist Explanatory Virtues Framework drawing on four perspectives from the Philosophy of Science - the Bayesian, Kuhnian, Deutschian, and Nomological - to systematically evaluate and improve explanations in MI. We find that Compact Proofs consider many explanatory virtues and are hence a promising approach. Fruitful research directions implied by our framework include (1) clearly defining explanatory simplicity, (2) focusing on unifying explanations and (3) deriving universal principles for neural networks. Improved MI methods enhance our ability to monitor, predict, and steer AI systems.

Abstract: We present FalconWing -- an open-source, ultra-lightweight (150 g) fixed-wing platform for autonomy research. The hardware platform integrates a small camera, a standard airframe, offboard computation, and radio communication for manual overrides. We demonstrate FalconWing's capabilities by developing and deploying a purely vision-based control policy for autonomous landing (without IMU or motion capture) using a novel real-to-sim-to-real learning approach. Our learning approach: (1) constructs a photorealistic simulation environment via 3D Gaussian splatting trained on real-world images; (2) identifies nonlinear dynamics from vision-estimated real-flight data; and (3) trains a multi-modal Vision Transformer (ViT) policy through simulation-only imitation learning. The ViT architecture fuses single RGB image with the history of control actions via self-attention, preserving temporal context while maintaining real-time 20 Hz inference. When deployed zero-shot on the hardware platform, this policy achieves an 80% success rate in vision-based autonomous landings. Together with the hardware specifications, we also open-source the system dynamics, the software for photorealistic simulator and the learning approach.

Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach combining Multimodal Deep Learning with intrinsic eXplainable Artificial Intelligence techniques to predict pathological response in non-small cell lung cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. Due to the limitations of existing radiomics and unimodal deep learning approaches, we introduce an intermediate fusion strategy that integrates imaging and clinical data, enabling efficient interaction between data modalities. The proposed Multimodal Doctor-in-the-Loop method further enhances clinical relevance by embedding clinicians' domain knowledge directly into the training process, guiding the model's focus gradually from broader lung regions to specific lesions. Results demonstrate improved predictive accuracy and explainability, providing insights into optimal data integration strategies for clinical applications.

Abstract: Self-improvement requires robotic systems to initially learn from human-provided data and then gradually enhance their capabilities through interaction with the environment. This is similar to how humans improve their skills through continuous practice. However, achieving effective self-improvement is challenging, primarily because robots tend to repeat their existing abilities during interactions, often failing to generate new, valuable data for learning. In this paper, we identify the key to successful self-improvement: modal-level exploration and data selection. By incorporating a modal-level exploration mechanism during policy execution, the robot can produce more diverse and multi-modal interactions. At the same time, we select the most valuable trials and high-quality segments from these interactions for learning. We successfully demonstrate effective robot self-improvement on both simulation benchmarks and real-world experiments. The capability for self-improvement will enable us to develop more robust and high-success-rate robotic control strategies at a lower cost.

Abstract: Human motion modeling traditionally separates motion generation and estimation into distinct tasks with specialized models. Motion generation models focus on creating diverse, realistic motions from inputs like text, audio, or keyframes, while motion estimation models aim to reconstruct accurate motion trajectories from observations like videos. Despite sharing underlying representations of temporal dynamics and kinematics, this separation limits knowledge transfer between tasks and requires maintaining separate models. We present GENMO, a unified Generalist Model for Human Motion that bridges motion estimation and generation in a single framework. Our key insight is to reformulate motion estimation as constrained motion generation, where the output motion must precisely satisfy observed conditioning signals. Leveraging the synergy between regression and diffusion, GENMO achieves accurate global motion estimation while enabling diverse motion generation. We also introduce an estimation-guided training objective that exploits in-the-wild videos with 2D annotations and text descriptions to enhance generative diversity. Furthermore, our novel architecture handles variable-length motions and mixed multimodal conditions (text, audio, video) at different time intervals, offering flexible control. This unified approach creates synergistic benefits: generative priors improve estimated motions under challenging conditions like occlusions, while diverse video data enhances generation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate GENMO's effectiveness as a generalist framework that successfully handles multiple human motion tasks within a single model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized a large variety of NLP tasks. An active debate is to what extent they can do reasoning and planning. Prior work has assessed the latter in the specific context of PDDL planning, based on manually converting three PDDL domains into natural language (NL) prompts. Here we automate this conversion step, showing how to leverage an LLM to automatically generate NL prompts from PDDL input. Our automatically generated NL prompts result in similar LLM-planning performance as the previous manually generated ones. Beyond this, the automation enables us to run much larger experiments, providing for the first time a broad evaluation of LLM planning performance in PDDL. Our NL prompts yield better performance than PDDL prompts and simple template-based NL prompts. Compared to symbolic planners, LLM planning lags far behind; but in some domains, our best LLM configuration scales up further than A$^\star$ using LM-cut.

Abstract: Interest in solving table interpretation tasks has grown over the years, yet it still relies on existing datasets that may be overly simplified. This is potentially reducing the effectiveness of the dataset for thorough evaluation and failing to accurately represent tables as they appear in the real-world. To enrich the existing benchmark datasets, we extract and annotate a new, more challenging dataset. The proposed Wiki-TabNER dataset features complex tables containing several entities per cell, with named entities labeled using DBpedia classes. This dataset is specifically designed to address named entity recognition (NER) task within tables, but it can also be used as a more challenging dataset for evaluating the entity linking task. In this paper we describe the distinguishing features of the Wiki-TabNER dataset and the labeling process. In addition, we propose a prompting framework for evaluating the new large language models on the within tables NER task. Finally, we perform qualitative analysis to gain insights into the challenges encountered by the models and to understand the limitations of the proposed~dataset.

<title>LLM-PySC2: Starcraft II learning environment for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The tremendous potential has been demonstrated by large language models (LLMs) in intelligent decision-making problems, with unprecedented capabilities shown across diverse applications ranging from gaming AI systems to complex strategic planning frameworks. However, the StarCraft II platform, which has been widely adopted for validating decision-making algorithms in the past decade, has not yet provided substantial support for this emerging domain. To address issues that LLMs cannot interface with the hundreds of actions of the pysc2 backend and the lack of native support for multi-agent (MA) collaboration, we propose the LLM-PySC2 environment. This is the first environment that offers LLMs the complete pysc2 action space with sufficient multi-modal information and game Wiki knowledge. With an asynchronous query architecture, the environment efficiently interacts with LLMs that maintain a constant latency regardless of the scale of the agents' population. In the experiments, we evaluated LLMs' decision-making performance in both the macro-decision and micro-operation scenarios, with traditional StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) tasks and a series of new proposed. Results indicate that LLMs possess the potential to achieve victories in complex scenarios but cannot constantly generate correct decisions, especially in the recovered pysc2 action space and MA settings. Without task-relevant instructions, the pre-trained models suffer from issues such as hallucinations and inefficient collaboration. Our findings suggest that StarCraft II still challenges in the era of large models, revealing that there is a lot to do to develop an advanced LLM decision-making system, and the proposed LLM-PySC2 environment will support future development of LLM-based decision-making solutions.

<title>Learning Lifted STRIPS Models from Action Traces Alone: A Simple, General, and Scalable Solution</title>

Abstract: Learning STRIPS action models from action traces alone is a challenging problem as it involves learning the domain predicates as well. In this work, a novel approach is introduced which, like the well-known LOCM systems, is scalable, but like SAT approaches, is sound and complete. Furthermore, the approach is general and imposes no restrictions on the hidden domain or the number or arity of the predicates. The new learning method is based on an \emph{efficient, novel test} that checks whether the assumption that a predicate is affected by a set of action patterns, namely, actions with specific argument positions, is consistent with the traces. The predicates and action patterns that pass the test provide the basis for the learned domain that is then easily completed with preconditions and static predicates. The new method is studied theoretically and experimentally. For the latter, the method is evaluated on traces and graphs obtained from standard classical domains like the 8-puzzle, which involve hundreds of thousands of states and transitions. The learned representations are then verified on larger instances.

Abstract: Do generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, trained only to predict the next token, implicitly learn a world model from which a sequence is generated one token at a time? We address this question by deriving a causal interpretation of the attention mechanism in GPT, and suggesting a causal world model that arises from this interpretation. Furthermore, we propose that GPT models, at inference time, can be utilized for zero-shot causal structure learning for input sequences and present a confidence score. Empirical evaluation is conducted in a controlled environment using the setup and rules of the Othello and Chess strategy games. A GPT, pre-trained on real-world games played with the intention of winning, is tested on out-of-distribution synthetic data consisting of sequences of random legal moves. We find that the GPT model is likely to generate legal next moves for out-of-distribution sequences for which a causal structure is encoded in the attention mechanism with high confidence. In cases for which the GPT model generates illegal moves it also fails to capture any causal structure.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease Analysis Model (ADAM) is a multi-agent reasoning large language model (LLM) framework designed to integrate and analyze multimodal data, including microbiome profiles, clinical datasets, and external knowledge bases, to enhance the understanding and classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD). By leveraging the agentic system with LLM, ADAM produces insights from diverse data sources and contextualizes the findings with literature-driven evidence. A comparative evaluation with XGBoost revealed a significantly improved mean F1 score and significantly reduced variance for ADAM, highlighting its robustness and consistency, particularly when utilizing human biological data. Although currently tailored for binary classification tasks with two data modalities, future iterations will aim to incorporate additional data types, such as neuroimaging and peripheral biomarkers, and expand them to predict disease progression, thereby broadening ADAM's scalability and applicability in AD research and diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Smart traffic lights in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) are envisioned to greatly increase traffic efficiency and reduce congestion. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach to adaptively control traffic lights based on the real-time traffic situation in a road network. However, conventional methods may suffer from poor scalability. In this paper, we investigate deep reinforcement learning to control traffic lights, and both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments show that the intelligent behavior ``greenwave" (i.e., a vehicle will see a progressive cascade of green lights, and not have to brake at any intersection) emerges naturally a grid road network, which is proved to be the optimal policy in an avenue with multiple cross streets. As a first step, we use two DRL algorithms for the traffic light control problems in two scenarios. In a single road intersection, we verify that the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm delivers a thresholding policy; and in a grid road network, we adopt the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Secondly, numerical experiments show that the DQN algorithm delivers the optimal control, and the DDPG algorithm with passive observations has the capability to produce on its own a high-level intelligent behavior in a grid road network, namely, the ``greenwave" policy emerges. We also verify the ``greenwave" patterns in a $5 \times 10$ grid road network. Thirdly, the ``greenwave" patterns demonstrate that DRL algorithms produce favorable solutions since the ``greenwave" policy shown in experiment results is proved to be optimal in a specified traffic model (an avenue with multiple cross streets). The delivered policies both in a single road intersection and a grid road network demonstrate the scalability of DRL algorithms.

Abstract: Continual learning is crucial for applying machine learning in challenging, dynamic, and often resource-constrained environments. However, catastrophic forgetting - overwriting previously learned knowledge when new information is acquired - remains a major challenge. In this work, we examine the intermediate representations in neural network layers during continual learning and find that such representations are less prone to forgetting, highlighting their potential to accelerate computation. Motivated by these findings, we propose to use auxiliary classifiers(ACs) to enhance performance and demonstrate that integrating ACs into various continual learning methods consistently improves accuracy across diverse evaluation settings, yielding an average 10% relative gain. We also leverage the ACs to reduce the average cost of the inference by 10-60% without compromising accuracy, enabling the model to return the predictions before computing all the layers. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient solution for continual learning.

<title>Do Vision &amp; Language Decoders use Images and Text equally? How Self-consistent are their Explanations?</title>

Abstract: Vision and language model (VLM) decoders are currently the best-performing architectures on multimodal tasks. Next to answers, they are able to produce natural language explanations, either in post-hoc or CoT settings. However, it is not clear to what extent they are using the input vision and text modalities when generating answers or explanations. In this work, we investigate if VLMs rely on their input modalities differently when they produce explanations as opposed to answers. We also evaluate the self-consistency of VLM decoders in both post-hoc and CoT explanation settings, by extending existing unimodal tests and measures to VLM decoders. We find that most tested VLMs are less self-consistent than LLMs. Text contributions in all tested VL decoders are more important than image contributions in all examined tasks. However, when comparing explanation generation to answer generation, the contributions of images are significantly stronger for generating explanations compared to answers. This difference is even larger in CoT compared to post-hoc explanations. Lastly, we provide an up-to-date benchmarking of state-of-the-art VL decoders on the VALSE benchmark, which before was restricted to VL encoders. We find that the tested VL decoders still struggle with most phenomena tested by VALSE.

Abstract: In pioneering work from 2019, Barcel\'o and coauthors identified logics that precisely match the expressive power of constant iteration-depth graph neural networks (GNNs) relative to properties definable in first-order logic. In this article, we give exact logical characterizations of recurrent GNNs in two scenarios: (1) in the setting with floating-point numbers and (2) with reals. For floats, the formalism matching recurrent GNNs is a rule-based modal logic with counting, while for reals we use a suitable infinitary modal logic, also with counting. These results give exact matches between logics and GNNs in the recurrent setting without relativising to a background logic in either case, but using some natural assumptions about floating-point arithmetic. Applying our characterizations, we also prove that, relative to graph properties definable in monadic second-order logic (MSO), our infinitary and rule-based logics are equally expressive. This implies that recurrent GNNs with reals and floats have the same expressive power over MSO-definable properties and shows that, for such properties, also recurrent GNNs with reals are characterized by a (finitary!) rule-based modal logic. In the general case, in contrast, the expressive power with floats is weaker than with reals. In addition to logic-oriented results, we also characterize recurrent GNNs, with both reals and floats, via distributed automata, drawing links to distributed computing models.

Abstract: This paper shows that dimensionality reduction methods such as UMAP and t-SNE, can be approximately recast as MAP inference methods corresponding to a model introduced in Ravuri et al. (2023), that describes the graph Laplacian (an estimate of the data precision matrix) using a Wishart distribution, with a mean given by a non-linear covariance function evaluated on the latents. This interpretation offers deeper theoretical and semantic insights into such algorithms, and forging a connection to Gaussian process latent variable models by showing that well-known kernels can be used to describe covariances implied by graph Laplacians. We also introduce tools with which similar dimensionality reduction methods can be studied.

arXiv:2406.13725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many variants of Optimal Transport (OT) have been developed to address its heavy computation. Among them, notably, Sliced Wasserstein (SW) is widely used for application domains by projecting the OT problem onto one-dimensional lines, and leveraging the closed-form expression of the univariate OT to reduce the computational burden. However, projecting measures onto low-dimensional spaces can lead to a loss of topological information. To mitigate this issue, in this work, we propose to replace one-dimensional lines with a more intricate structure, called tree systems. This structure is metrizable by a tree metric, which yields a closed-form expression for OT problems on tree systems. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis to formally define tree systems with their topological properties, introduce the concept of splitting maps, which operate as the projection mechanism onto these structures, then finally propose a novel variant of Radon transform for tree systems and verify its injectivity. This framework leads to an efficient metric between measures, termed Tree-Sliced Wasserstein distance on Systems of Lines (TSW-SL). By conducting a variety of experiments on gradient flows, image style transfer, and generative models, we illustrate that our proposed approach performs favorably compared to SW and its variants.

<title>Towards Aligned Data Removal via Twin Machine Unlearning</title>

Abstract: Modern privacy regulations have spurred the evolution of machine unlearning, a technique that enables the removal of data from an already trained ML model without requiring retraining from scratch. Previous unlearning methods tend to induce the model to achieve lowest classification accuracy on the removal data. Nonetheless, the authentic objective of machine unlearning is to align the unlearned model with the gold model, i.e., achieving the same classification accuracy as the gold model. For this purpose, we present a Twin Machine Unlearning (TMU) approach, where a twin unlearning problem is defined corresponding to the original unlearning problem. As a results, the generalization-label predictor trained on the twin problem can be transferred to the original problem, facilitating aligned data removal. Comprehensive empirical experiments illustrate that our approach significantly enhances the alignment between the unlearned model and the gold model. Meanwhile, our method allows data removal without compromising the model accuracy.

<title>Reward Guidance for Reinforcement Learning Tasks Based on Large Language Models: The LMGT Framework</title>

arXiv:2409.04744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inherent uncertainty in the environmental transition model of Reinforcement Learning (RL) necessitates a delicate balance between exploration and exploitation. This balance is crucial for optimizing computational resources to accurately estimate expected rewards for the agent. In scenarios with sparse rewards, such as robotic control systems, achieving this balance is particularly challenging. However, given that many environments possess extensive prior knowledge, learning from the ground up in such contexts may be redundant. To address this issue, we propose Language Model Guided reward Tuning (LMGT), a novel, sample-efficient framework. LMGT leverages the comprehensive prior knowledge embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their proficiency in processing non-standard data forms, such as wiki tutorials. By utilizing LLM-guided reward shifts, LMGT adeptly balances exploration and exploitation, thereby guiding the agent's exploratory behavior and enhancing sample efficiency. We have rigorously evaluated LMGT across various RL tasks and evaluated it in the embodied robotic environment Housekeep. Our results demonstrate that LMGT consistently outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, the findings suggest that our framework can substantially reduce the computational resources required during the RL training phase.

<title>Offline Model-Based Optimization by Learning to Rank</title>

Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to identify a design that maximizes a black-box function using only a fixed, pre-collected dataset of designs and their corresponding scores. A common approach in offline MBO is to train a regression-based surrogate model by minimizing mean squared error (MSE) and then find the best design within this surrogate model by different optimizers (e.g., gradient ascent). However, a critical challenge is the risk of out-of-distribution errors, i.e., the surrogate model may typically overestimate the scores and mislead the optimizers into suboptimal regions. Prior works have attempted to address this issue in various ways, such as using regularization techniques and ensemble learning to enhance the robustness of the model, but it still remains. In this paper, we argue that regression models trained with MSE are not well-aligned with the primary goal of offline MBO, which is to select promising designs rather than to predict their scores precisely. Notably, if a surrogate model can maintain the order of candidate designs based on their relative score relationships, it can produce the best designs even without precise predictions. To validate it, we conduct experiments to compare the relationship between the quality of the final designs and MSE, finding that the correlation is really very weak. In contrast, a metric that measures order-maintaining quality shows a significantly stronger correlation. Based on this observation, we propose learning a ranking-based model that leverages learning to rank techniques to prioritize promising designs based on their relative scores. We show that the generalization error on ranking loss can be well bounded. Empirical results across diverse tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed ranking-based models than twenty existing methods.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation is a crucial and useful technology for virtual human interaction and film-making. While recent advances have focused on improving image fidelity and lip synchronization, generating accurate emotional expressions remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce EmoGene, a novel framework for synthesizing high-fidelity, audio-driven video portraits with accurate emotional expressions. Our approach employs a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based audio-to-motion module to generate facial landmarks, which are concatenated with emotional embedding in a motion-to-emotion module to produce emotional landmarks. These landmarks drive a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based emotion-to-video module to render realistic emotional talking-head videos. Additionally, we propose a pose sampling method to generate natural idle-state (non-speaking) videos for silent audio inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EmoGene outperforms previous methods in generating high-fidelity emotional talking-head videos.

Abstract: Pretrained foundation models have exhibited extraordinary in-context learning performance, allowing zero-shot generalization to new tasks not encountered during pretraining. In the case of reinforcement learning (RL), in-context RL (ICRL) emerges when pretraining FMs on decision-making problems in an autoregressive-supervised manner. Nevertheless, current state-of-the-art ICRL algorithms, like Algorithm Distillation, Decision Pretrained Transformer and Decision Importance Transformer, impose stringent requirements on the pretraining dataset concerning the source policies, context information, and action labels. Notably, these algorithms either demand optimal policies or require varying degrees of well-trained behavior policies for all pretraining environments. This significantly hinders the application of ICRL to real-world scenarios, where acquiring optimal or well-trained policies for a substantial volume of real-world training environments can be intractable. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel approach, termed State-Action Distillation (SAD), that allows to generate an effective pretraining dataset guided solely by random policies. In particular, SAD selects query states and corresponding action labels by distilling outstanding state-action pairs from the entire state and action spaces by using random policies within a trust horizon, and then inherits the classical autoregressive-supervised mechanism during pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables effective ICRL under random policies and random contexts. We also establish quantitative analysis of the trustworthiness as well as the performance guarantees of SAD. Moreover, our empirical results across multiple popular ICRL benchmark environments demonstrate that, on average, SAD outperforms the best baseline by 236.3% in the offline evaluation and by 135.2% in the online evaluation.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents are increasingly applied in the recommendation field due to their extensive knowledge and strong planning capabilities. While prior research has primarily focused on enhancing either the recommendation agent or the user agent individually, the collaborative interaction between the two has often been overlooked. Towards this research gap, we propose a novel framework that emphasizes the feedback loop process to facilitate the collaboration between the recommendation agent and the user agent. Specifically, the recommendation agent refines its understanding of user preferences by analyzing the feedback from the user agent on the item recommendation. Conversely, the user agent further identifies potential user interests based on the items and recommendation reasons provided by the recommendation agent. This iterative process enhances the ability of both agents to infer user behaviors, enabling more effective item recommendations and more accurate user simulations. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the agentic feedback loop: the agentic feedback loop yields an average improvement of 11.52% over the single recommendation agent and 21.12% over the single user agent. Furthermore, the results show that the agentic feedback loop does not exacerbate popularity or position bias, which are typically amplified by the real-world feedback loop, highlighting its robustness.

Abstract: Designing quantum circuits for specific tasks is challenging due to the exponential growth of the state space. We introduce gadget reinforcement learning (GRL), which integrates reinforcement learning with program synthesis to automatically generate and incorporate composite gates (gadgets) into the action space. This enhances the exploration of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for complex tasks like approximating ground states of quantum Hamiltonians, an NP-hard problem. We evaluate GRL using the transverse field Ising model under typical computational budgets (e.g., 2- 3 days of GPU runtime). Our results show improved accuracy, hardware compatibility and scalability. GRL exhibits robust performance as the size and complexity of the problem increases, even with constrained computational resources. By integrating gadget extraction, GRL facilitates the discovery of reusable circuit components tailored for specific hardware, bridging the gap between algorithmic design and practical implementation. This makes GRL a versatile framework for optimizing quantum circuits with applications in hardware-specific optimizations and variational quantum algorithms.

Abstract: We study the problem of robot navigation in dense and interactive crowds with environmental constraints such as corridors and furniture. Previous methods fail to consider all types of interactions among agents and obstacles, leading to unsafe and inefficient robot paths. In this article, we leverage a graph-based representation of crowded and constrained scenarios and propose a structured framework to learn robot navigation policies with deep reinforcement learning. We first split the representations of different components in the environment and propose a heterogeneous spatio-temporal (st) graph to model distinct interactions among humans, robots, and obstacles. Based on the heterogeneous st-graph, we propose HEIGHT, a novel navigation policy network architecture with different components to capture heterogeneous interactions among entities through space and time. HEIGHT utilizes attention mechanisms to prioritize important interactions and a recurrent network to track changes in the dynamic scene over time, encouraging the robot to avoid collisions adaptively. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that HEIGHT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of success and efficiency in challenging navigation scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our pipeline achieves better zero-shot generalization capability than previous works when the densities of humans and obstacles change.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) can produce unintended and harmful content when exposed to adversarial attacks, particularly because their vision capabilities create new vulnerabilities. Existing defenses, such as input preprocessing, adversarial training, and response evaluation-based methods, are often impractical for real-world deployment due to their high costs. To address this challenge, we propose ASTRA, an efficient and effective defense by adaptively steering models away from adversarial feature directions to resist VLM attacks. Our key procedures involve finding transferable steering vectors representing the direction of harmful response and applying adaptive activation steering to remove these directions at inference time. To create effective steering vectors, we randomly ablate the visual tokens from the adversarial images and identify those most strongly associated with jailbreaks. These tokens are then used to construct steering vectors. During inference, we perform the adaptive steering method that involves the projection between the steering vectors and calibrated activation, resulting in little performance drops on benign inputs while strongly avoiding harmful outputs under adversarial inputs. Extensive experiments across multiple models and baselines demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance and high efficiency in mitigating jailbreak risks. Additionally, ASTRA exhibits good transferability, defending against unseen attacks (i.e., structured-based attack, perturbation-based attack with project gradient descent variants, and text-only attack).

Abstract: Traditional greedy tokenization methods have been a critical step in Natural Language Processing (NLP), influencing how text is converted into tokens and directly impacting model performance. While subword tokenizers like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used, questions remain about their optimality across model scales and languages. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive experiments that an optimal BPE configuration significantly reduces token count compared to greedy segmentation, yielding improvements in token-saving percentages and performance benefits, particularly for smaller models. We evaluate tokenization performance across various intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, including generation and classification. Our findings suggest that compression-optimized tokenization strategies could provide substantial advantages for multilingual and low-resource language applications, highlighting a promising direction for further research and inclusive NLP.

Abstract: Answering natural language (NL) questions about tables, known as Tabular Question Answering (TQA), is crucial because it allows users to quickly and efficiently extract meaningful insights from structured data, effectively bridging the gap between human language and machine-readable formats. Many of these tables are derived from web sources or real-world scenarios, which require meticulous data preparation (or data prep) to ensure accurate responses. However, preparing such tables for NL questions introduces new requirements that extend beyond traditional data preparation. This question-aware data preparation involves specific tasks such as column derivation and filtering tailored to particular questions, as well as question-aware value normalization or conversion, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach in this context. Because each of the above tasks is unique, a single model (or agent) may not perform effectively across all scenarios. In this paper, we propose AutoPrep, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that leverages the strengths of multiple agents, each specialized in a certain type of data prep, ensuring more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Given an NL question over a table, AutoPrep performs data prep through three key components. Planner: Determines a logical plan, outlining a sequence of high-level operations. Programmer: Translates this logical plan into a physical plan by generating the corresponding low-level code. Executor: Executes the generated code to process the table. To support this multi-agent framework, we design a novel Chain-of-Clauses reasoning mechanism for high-level operation suggestion, and a tool-augmented method for low-level code generation...

Abstract: We present DriveGPT, a scalable behavior model for autonomous driving. We model driving as a sequential decision-making task, and learn a transformer model to predict future agent states as tokens in an autoregressive fashion. We scale up our model parameters and training data by multiple orders of magnitude, enabling us to explore the scaling properties in terms of dataset size, model parameters, and compute. We evaluate DriveGPT across different scales in a planning task, through both quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, including closed-loop driving in complex real-world scenarios. In a separate prediction task, DriveGPT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits improved performance by pretraining on a large-scale dataset, further validating the benefits of data scaling.

<title>ICLR: In-Context Learning of Representations</title>

arXiv:2501.00070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that semantics specified by pretraining data influence how representations of different concepts are organized in a large language model (LLM). However, given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their ability to in-context learn, we can ask whether models alter these pretraining semantics to adopt alternative, context-specified ones. Specifically, if we provide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what the pretraining data suggests, do models reorganize their representations in accordance with these novel semantics? To answer this question, we take inspiration from the theory of conceptual role semantics and define a toy "graph tracing" task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts seen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.) and the connectivity of the graph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given exemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze intermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of context is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization from pretrained semantic representations to in-context representations aligned with the graph structure. Further, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their semantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure is still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the pretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy minimization for a predefined graph topology, providing evidence towards an implicit optimization process to infer context-specified semantics. Overall, our findings indicate scaling context-size can flexibly re-organize model representations, possibly unlocking novel capabilities.

<title>Dynamics of Spontaneous Topic Changes in Next Token Prediction with Self-Attention</title>

Abstract: Human cognition is punctuated by abrupt, spontaneous shifts between topics-driven by emotional, contextual, or associative cues-a phenomenon known as spontaneous thought in neuroscience. In contrast, self-attention based models depend on structured patterns over their inputs to predict each next token, lacking spontaneity. Motivated by this distinction, we characterize spontaneous topic changes in self-attention architectures, revealing both their similarities and their divergences from spontaneous human thought. First, we establish theoretical results under a simplified, single-layer self-attention model with suitable conditions by defining the topic as a set of Token Priority Graphs (TPGs). Specifically, we demonstrate that (1) the model maintains the priority order of tokens related to the input topic, (2) a spontaneous topic change can occur only if lower-priority tokens outnumber all higher-priority tokens of the input topic, and (3) unlike human cognition, the longer context length or the more ambiguous input topic reduces the likelihood of spontaneous change. Second, we empirically validate that these dynamics persist in modern, state-of-the-art LLMs, underscoring a fundamental disparity between human cognition and AI behaviour in the context of spontaneous topic changes. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has explored these questions with a focus as closely aligned to human thought.

Abstract: Surrogate models are frequently employed as efficient substitutes for the costly execution of real-world processes. However, constructing a high-quality surrogate model often demands extensive data acquisition. A solution to this issue is to transfer pre-trained surrogate models for new tasks, provided that certain invariances exist between tasks. This study focuses on transferring non-differentiable surrogate models (e.g., random forests) from a source function to a target function, where we assume their domains are related by an unknown affine transformation, using only a limited amount of transfer data points evaluated on the target. Previous research attempts to tackle this challenge for differentiable models, e.g., Gaussian process regression, which minimizes the empirical loss on the transfer data by tuning the affine transformations. In this paper, we extend the previous work to the random forest and assess its effectiveness on a widely-used artificial problem set - Black-Box Optimization Benchmark (BBOB) testbed, and on four real-world transfer learning problems. The results highlight the significant practical advantages of the proposed method, particularly in reducing both the data requirements and computational costs of training surrogate models for complex real-world scenarios.

arXiv:2502.01976v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks but suffer from high computational costs during inference, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Collaborative Inference with Token-lEvel Routing (CITER) framework that enables efficient collaboration between small and large language models (SLMs \& LLMs) through a token-level routing strategy. Specifically, CITER routes non-critical tokens to an SLM for efficiency and routes critical tokens to an LLM for generalization quality. We formulate router training as a policy optimization, where the router receives rewards based on both the quality of predictions and the inference costs of generation. This allows the router to learn to predict token-level routing scores and make routing decisions based on both the current token and the future impact of its decisions. To further accelerate the reward evaluation process, we introduce a shortcut which significantly reduces the costs of the reward estimation and improving the practicality of our approach. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that CITER reduces the inference costs while preserving high-quality generation, offering a promising solution for real-time and resource-constrained applications. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/CITER.

<title>MELON: Provable Indirect Prompt Injection Defense via Masked Re-execution and Tool Comparison</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.05174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has explored that LLM agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious tasks embedded in tool-retrieved information can redirect the agent to take unauthorized actions. Existing defenses against IPI have significant limitations: either require essential model training resources, lack effectiveness against sophisticated attacks, or harm the normal utilities. We present MELON (Masked re-Execution and TooL comparisON), a novel IPI defense. Our approach builds on the observation that under a successful attack, the agent's next action becomes less dependent on user tasks and more on malicious tasks. Following this, we design MELON to detect attacks by re-executing the agent's trajectory with a masked user prompt modified through a masking function. We identify an attack if the actions generated in the original and masked executions are similar. We also include three key designs to reduce the potential false positives and false negatives. Extensive evaluation on the IPI benchmark AgentDojo demonstrates that MELON outperforms SOTA defenses in both attack prevention and utility preservation. Moreover, we show that combining MELON with a SOTA prompt augmentation defense (denoted as MELON-Aug) further improves its performance. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate our key designs.

arXiv:2502.09762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive teaming-the capability of agents to effectively collaborate with unfamiliar teammates without prior coordination-is widely explored in virtual video games but overlooked in real-world multi-robot contexts. Yet, such adaptive collaboration is crucial for real-world applications, including border surveillance, search-and-rescue, and counter-terrorism operations. To address this gap, we introduce AT-Drone, the first dedicated benchmark explicitly designed to facilitate comprehensive training and evaluation of adaptive teaming strategies in multi-drone pursuit scenarios. AT-Drone makes the following key contributions: (1) An adaptable simulation environment configurator that enables intuitive and rapid setup of adaptive teaming multi-drone pursuit tasks, including four predefined pursuit environments. (2) A streamlined real-world deployment pipeline that seamlessly translates simulation insights into practical drone evaluations using edge devices and Crazyflie drones. (3) A novel algorithm zoo integrated with a distributed training framework, featuring diverse algorithms explicitly tailored, for the first time, to multi-pursuer and multi-evader settings. (4) Standardized evaluation protocols with newly designed unseen drone zoos, explicitly designed to rigorously assess the performance of adaptive teaming. Comprehensive experimental evaluations across four progressively challenging multi-drone pursuit scenarios confirm AT-Drone's effectiveness in advancing adaptive teaming research. Real-world drone experiments further validate its practical feasibility and utility for realistic robotic operations.

Abstract: Recent XAI studies have investigated what constitutes a \textit{good} explanation in AI-assisted decision-making. Despite the widely accepted human-friendly properties of explanations, such as contrastive and selective, existing studies have yielded inconsistent findings. To address these gaps, our study focuses on the cognitive dimensions of explanation evaluation, by evaluating six explanations with different contrastive strategies and information selectivity and scrutinizing factors behind their valuation process. Our analysis results find that contrastive explanations are not the most preferable or understandable in general; Rather, different contrastive and selective explanations were appreciated to a different extent based on who they are, when, how, and what to explain -- with different level of cognitive load and engagement and sociotechnical contexts. Given these findings, we call for a nuanced view of explanation strategies, with implications for designing AI interfaces to accommodate individual and contextual differences in AI-assisted decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in proving formal theorems using proof assistants like Lean. However, current state of the art language models struggles to predict next step in proofs leading practitioners to use different sampling techniques to improve LLMs capabilities. We observe that the LLM is capable of predicting the correct tactic; however, it faces challenges in ranking it appropriately within the set of candidate tactics, affecting the overall selection process. To overcome this hurdle, we use activation steering to guide LLMs responses to improve the generations at the time of inference. Our results suggest that activation steering offers a promising lightweight alternative to specialized fine-tuning for enhancing theorem proving capabilities in LLMs, particularly valuable in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: In this study, we implement a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) to generate multi-channel resting-state EEG data and assess the quality of the synthesized signals through both visual and feature-based evaluations. Our results indicate that the model effectively captures the statistical and spectral characteristics of real EEG data, although challenges remain in replicating high-frequency oscillations in the frontal region. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Critic's learned representations can be reused for gender classification task, achieving an out-of-sample accuracy, significantly better than a shuffled-label baseline and a model trained directly on EEG data. These findings suggest that generative models can serve not only as EEG data generators but also as unsupervised feature extractors, reducing the need for manual feature engineering. This study highlights the potential of GAN-based unsupervised learning for EEG analysis, suggesting avenues for more data-efficient deep learning applications in neuroscience.

arXiv:2503.03045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents ArticuBot, in which a single learned policy enables a robotics system to open diverse categories of unseen articulated objects in the real world. This task has long been challenging for robotics due to the large variations in the geometry, size, and articulation types of such objects. Our system, Articubot, consists of three parts: generating a large number of demonstrations in physics-based simulation, distilling all generated demonstrations into a point cloud-based neural policy via imitation learning, and performing zero-shot sim2real transfer to real robotics systems. Utilizing sampling-based grasping and motion planning, our demonstration generalization pipeline is fast and effective, generating a total of 42.3k demonstrations over 322 training articulated objects. For policy learning, we propose a novel hierarchical policy representation, in which the high-level policy learns the sub-goal for the end-effector, and the low-level policy learns how to move the end-effector conditioned on the predicted goal. We demonstrate that this hierarchical approach achieves much better object-level generalization compared to the non-hierarchical version. We further propose a novel weighted displacement model for the high-level policy that grounds the prediction into the existing 3D structure of the scene, outperforming alternative policy representations. We show that our learned policy can zero-shot transfer to three different real robot settings: a fixed table-top Franka arm across two different labs, and an X-Arm on a mobile base, opening multiple unseen articulated objects across two labs, real lounges, and kitchens. Videos and code can be found on our project website: https://articubot.github.io/.

Abstract: Dynamic emotion recognition in the wild remains challenging due to the transient nature of emotional expressions and temporal misalignment of multi-modal cues. Traditional approaches predict valence and arousal and often overlook the inherent correlation between these two dimensions. The proposed Multi-modal Attention for Valence-Arousal Emotion Network (MAVEN) integrates visual, audio, and textual modalities through a bi-directional cross-modal attention mechanism. MAVEN uses modality-specific encoders to extract features from synchronized video frames, audio segments, and transcripts, predicting emotions in polar coordinates following Russell's circumplex model. The evaluation of the Aff-Wild2 dataset using MAVEN achieved a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.3061, surpassing the ResNet-50 baseline model with a CCC of 0.22. The multistage architecture captures the subtle and transient nature of emotional expressions in conversational videos and improves emotion recognition in real-world situations.

arXiv:2504.13068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between deep learning (DL) model accuracy and expert agreement in classifying crash narratives. We evaluate five DL models -- including BERT variants, USE, and a zero-shot classifier -- against expert labels and narratives, and extend the analysis to four large language models (LLMs): GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen, and Claude. Our findings reveal an inverse relationship: models with higher technical accuracy often show lower agreement with human experts, while LLMs demonstrate stronger expert alignment despite lower accuracy. We use Cohen's Kappa and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to quantify and visualize model-expert agreement, and employ SHAP analysis to explain misclassifications. Results show that expert-aligned models rely more on contextual and temporal cues than location-specific keywords. These findings suggest that accuracy alone is insufficient for safety-critical NLP tasks. We argue for incorporating expert agreement into model evaluation frameworks and highlight the potential of LLMs as interpretable tools in crash analysis pipelines.

arXiv:2504.14204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection holds notable importance for risk identification and fault detection across diverse application domains. Unsupervised learning methods have become popular because they have no requirement for labels. However, due to the challenges posed by the multiplicity of abnormal patterns, the sparsity of anomalies, and the growth of data scale and complexity, these methods often fail to capture robust and representative dependencies within the time series for identifying anomalies. To enhance the ability of models to capture normal patterns of time series and avoid the retrogression of modeling ability triggered by the dependencies on high-quality prior knowledge, we propose a differencing-based contrastive representation learning framework for time series anomaly detection (DConAD). Specifically, DConAD generates differential data to provide additional information about time series and utilizes transformer-based architecture to capture spatiotemporal dependencies, which enhances the robustness of unbiased representation learning ability. Furthermore, DConAD implements a novel KL divergence-based contrastive learning paradigm that only uses positive samples to avoid deviation from reconstruction and deploys the stop-gradient strategy to compel convergence. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show the superiority and effectiveness of DConAD compared with nine baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/shaieesss/DConAD.

Abstract: This paper presents an automated one-shot bird call classification pipeline designed for rare species absent from large publicly available classifiers like BirdNET and Perch. While these models excel at detecting common birds with abundant training data, they lack options for species with only 1-3 known recordings-a critical limitation for conservationists monitoring the last remaining individuals of endangered birds. To address this, we leverage the embedding space of large bird classification networks and develop a classifier using cosine similarity, combined with filtering and denoising preprocessing techniques, to optimize detection with minimal training data. We evaluate various embedding spaces using clustering metrics and validate our approach in both a simulated scenario with Xeno-Canto recordings and a real-world test on the critically endangered tooth-billed pigeon (Didunculus strigirostris), which has no existing classifiers and only three confirmed recordings. The final model achieved 1.0 recall and 0.95 accuracy in detecting tooth-billed pigeon calls, making it practical for use in the field. This open-source system provides a practical tool for conservationists seeking to detect and monitor rare species on the brink of extinction.

Abstract: This position paper critically surveys a broad spectrum of recent empirical developments on human-AI agents collaboration, highlighting both their technical achievements and persistent gaps. We observe a lack of a unifying theoretical framework that can coherently integrate these varied studies, especially when tackling open-ended, complex tasks. To address this, we propose a novel conceptual architecture: one that systematically interlinks the technical details of multi-agent coordination, knowledge management, cybernetic feedback loops, and higher-level control mechanisms. By mapping existing contributions, from symbolic AI techniques and connectionist LLM-based agents to hybrid organizational practices, onto this proposed framework (Hierarchical Exploration-Exploitation Net), our approach facilitates revision of legacy methods and inspires new work that fuses qualitative and quantitative paradigms. The paper's structure allows it to be read from any section, serving equally as a critical review of technical implementations and as a forward-looking reference for designing or extending human-AI symbioses. Together, these insights offer a stepping stone toward deeper co-evolution of human cognition and AI capability.

Abstract: This article deals with the description and recognition of fiber bundles, in particular nerves, in medical images, based on the anatomical description of the fiber trajectories. To this end, we propose a logical formalization of this anatomical knowledge. The intrinsically imprecise description of nerves, as found in anatomical textbooks, leads us to propose fuzzy semantics combined with first-order logic. We define a language representing spatial entities, relations between these entities and quantifiers. A formula in this language is then a formalization of the natural language description. The semantics are given by fuzzy representations in a concrete domain and satisfaction degrees of relations. Based on this formalization, a spatial reasoning algorithm is proposed for segmentation and recognition of nerves from anatomical and diffusion magnetic resonance images, which is illustrated on pelvic nerves in pediatric imaging, enabling surgeons to plan surgery.

<div> safety, reliability, generative AI, research outputs, deployment

Summary:<br /><br />Corporate AI research by leading companies and universities is compared based on safety and reliability papers from generative AI research. Corporate AI research focuses more on pre-deployment areas like model alignment and evaluation, neglecting deployment-stage issues such as model bias. Research gaps exist in high-risk deployment domains like healthcare and finance. Improved observability into deployed AI and expanded access to deployment data for external researchers are recommended to address growing knowledge deficits.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.00174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing on 1,178 safety and reliability papers from 9,439 generative AI papers (January 2020 - March 2025), we compare research outputs of leading AI companies (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI) and AI universities (CMU, MIT, NYU, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and University of Washington). We find that corporate AI research increasingly concentrates on pre-deployment areas -- model alignment and testing & evaluation -- while attention to deployment-stage issues such as model bias has waned. Significant research gaps exist in high-risk deployment domains, including healthcare, finance, misinformation, persuasive and addictive features, hallucinations, and copyright. Without improved observability into deployed AI, growing corporate concentration could deepen knowledge deficits. We recommend expanding external researcher access to deployment data and systematic observability of in-market AI behaviors.

Abstract: As AI systems become embedded in real-world applications, ensuring they meet ethical standards is crucial. While existing AI ethics frameworks emphasize fairness, transparency, and accountability, they often lack actionable evaluation methods. This paper introduces a systematic approach using the Responsible AI Labs (RAIL) framework, which includes eight measurable dimensions to assess the normative behavior of large language models (LLMs). We apply this framework to Anthropic's "Values in the Wild" dataset, containing over 308,000 anonymized conversations with Claude and more than 3,000 annotated value expressions. Our study maps these values to RAIL dimensions, computes synthetic scores, and provides insights into the ethical behavior of LLMs in real-world use.

Summary: 
The article introduces DeCo, an AI-driven approach for optimizing task assignment in IC testing processes. DeCo utilizes a defect-aware graph derived from IC testing reports to improve defect differentiation, even with limited data. It also creates defect-aware representations for engineers and tasks by incorporating both local and global structure modeling. The assignment mechanism of DeCo pairs testing tasks with QA engineers based on their skill level and workload, ensuring fair and efficient job dispatch. Experimental results show that DeCo achieves high task-handling success rates exceeding 80% in various scenarios, while maintaining balanced workloads regardless of defect data availability. Case studies demonstrate DeCo's ability to assign tasks to engineers even for unfamiliar defects, showcasing its potential as a valuable AI solution for real-world IC failure analysis and task handling. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.00278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the semiconductor industry, integrated circuit (IC) processes play a vital role, as the rising complexity and market expectations necessitate improvements in yield. Identifying IC defects and assigning IC testing tasks to the right engineers improves efficiency and reduces losses. While current studies emphasize fault localization or defect classification, they overlook the integration of defect characteristics, historical failures, and the insights from engineer expertise, which restrains their effectiveness in improving IC handling. To leverage AI for these challenges, we propose DeCo, an innovative approach for optimizing task assignment in IC testing. DeCo constructs a novel defect-aware graph from IC testing reports, capturing co-failure relationships to enhance defect differentiation, even with scarce defect data. Additionally, it formulates defect-aware representations for engineers and tasks, reinforced by local and global structure modeling on the defect-aware graph. Finally, a contrasting-based assignment mechanism pairs testing tasks with QA engineers by considering their skill level and current workload, thus promoting an equitable and efficient job dispatch. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DeCo achieves the highest task-handling success rates in different scenarios, exceeding 80\%, while also maintaining balanced workloads on both scarce or expanded defect data. Moreover, case studies reveal that DeCo can assign tasks to potentially capable engineers, even for their unfamiliar defects, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven solution for the real-world IC failure analysis and task handling.

Summary:
Understanding player behavior in online gaming is crucial for enhancing player experience and protection. This study introduces CognitionNet, a two-stage neural network that mines game behaviors and play styles from telemetry data on a Rummy gaming platform. By analyzing player moves and reactions, CognitionNet identifies micro-patterns of game behaviors and classifies play styles to provide insights into player psychology and decision-making. The network's collaborative training with a novel "bridge loss" formulation enables the discovery of consistent play style definitions and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This research marks a significant advancement in automating the discovery of player psychology and game tactics, as well as providing diagnostic explanations for player engagement predictions. <div>

Abstract: Games are one of the safest source of realizing self-esteem and relaxation at the same time. An online gaming platform typically has massive data coming in, e.g., in-game actions, player moves, clickstreams, transactions etc. It is rather interesting, as something as simple as data on gaming moves can help create a psychological imprint of the user at that moment, based on her impulsive reactions and response to a situation in the game. Mining this knowledge can: (a) immediately help better explain observed and predicted player behavior; and (b) consequently propel deeper understanding towards players' experience, growth and protection. To this effect, we focus on discovery of the "game behaviours" as micro-patterns formed by continuous sequence of games and the persistent "play styles" of the players' as a sequence of such sequences on an online skill gaming platform for Rummy. We propose a two stage deep neural network, CognitionNet. The first stage focuses on mining game behaviours as cluster representations in a latent space while the second aggregates over these micro patterns to discover play styles via a supervised classification objective around player engagement. The dual objective allows CognitionNet to reveal several player psychology inspired decision making and tactics. To our knowledge, this is the first and one-of-its-kind research to fully automate the discovery of: (i) player psychology and game tactics from telemetry data; and (ii) relevant diagnostic explanations to players' engagement predictions. The collaborative training of the two networks with differential input dimensions is enabled using a novel formulation of "bridge loss". The network plays pivotal role in obtaining homogeneous and consistent play style definitions and significantly outperforms the SOTA baselines wherever applicable.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging System of System (SoS) that faces challenges in system architecture, planning, task management, and execution. Traditional architectural approaches struggle with scalability, adaptability, and seamless resource integration within dynamic and complex environments. This paper presents an intelligent holonic architecture that incorporates Large Language Model (LLM) to manage the complexities of UAM. Holons function semi autonomously, allowing for real time coordination among air taxis, ground transport, and vertiports. LLMs process natural language inputs, generate adaptive plans, and manage disruptions such as weather changes or airspace closures.Through a case study of multimodal transportation with electric scooters and air taxis, we demonstrate how this architecture enables dynamic resource allocation, real time replanning, and autonomous adaptation without centralized control, creating more resilient and efficient urban transportation networks. By advancing decentralized control and AI driven adaptability, this work lays the groundwork for resilient, human centric UAM ecosystems, with future efforts targeting hybrid AI integration and real world validation.

Summary:
ScaleTrack introduces a training framework for automated GUI agents that addresses challenges in GUI grounding and planning. The framework leverages a diverse dataset of GUI samples to train grounding models effectively. It incorporates a novel training strategy that predicts the next action based on the current GUI image while backtracking historical actions that led to the image. This approach enables ScaleTrack to explain the relationship between GUI images and actions, enhancing the understanding of GUI environments. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of ScaleTrack in improving the performance of automated GUI agents. The dataset and code for ScaleTrack will be made available at a provided URL. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated GUI agents aims to facilitate user interaction by automatically performing complex tasks in digital environments, such as web, mobile, desktop devices. It receives textual task instruction and GUI description to generate executable actions (\emph{e.g.}, click) and operation boxes step by step. Training a GUI agent mainly involves grounding and planning stages, in which the GUI grounding focuses on finding the execution coordinates according to the task, while the planning stage aims to predict the next action based on historical actions. However, previous work suffers from the limitations of insufficient training data for GUI grounding, as well as the ignorance of backtracking historical behaviors for GUI planning. To handle the above challenges, we propose ScaleTrack, a training framework by scaling grounding and backtracking planning for automated GUI agents. We carefully collected GUI samples of different synthesis criterions from a wide range of sources, and unified them into the same template for training GUI grounding models. Moreover, we design a novel training strategy that predicts the next action from the current GUI image, while also backtracking the historical actions that led to the GUI image. In this way, ScaleTrack explains the correspondence between GUI images and actions, which effectively describes the evolution rules of the GUI environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ScaleTrack. Data and code will be available at url.

Summary: 
This paper introduces an extension to the existing classifier framework used in the legal domain by incorporating sets of rules to capture legal reasoning, which relies on both facts and rules, particularly the ratio decidendi. Building on the rule-based reason model of precedential constraint developed by Canavotto et al., this new approach allows for decisions in new cases to be inferred using an enriched rule-based classifier framework. By including the time element and hierarchy of courts in the classifier framework, this approach provides a more comprehensive model for legal decision-making. <div>
arXiv:2505.00474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the formal framework of classifier models used in the legal domain. While the existing classifier framework characterises cases solely through the facts involved, legal reasoning fundamentally relies on both facts and rules, particularly the ratio decidendi. This paper presents an initial approach to incorporating sets of rules within a classifier. Our work is built on the work of Canavotto et al. (2023), which has developed the rule-based reason model of precedential constraint within a hierarchy of factors. We demonstrate how decisions for new cases can be inferred using this enriched rule-based classifier framework. Additionally, we provide an example of how the time element and the hierarchy of courts can be used in the new classifier framework.

<title>Can LLMs Help Improve Analogical Reasoning For Strategic Decisions? Experimental Evidence from Humans and GPT-4</title>

<div> Keywords: language models, analogical reasoning, decision making, strategic, AI 

Summary: 
This study examines the ability of the GPT4 language model to perform analogical reasoning in strategic decision-making contexts compared to humans. While GPT4 shows high recall in retrieving analogies, it lacks precision, often applying incorrect analogies based on surface similarities. In contrast, humans exhibit higher precision but lower recall, selecting fewer analogies with stronger causal alignment. The research highlights the importance of accurate causal mapping in the evaluation phase of analogical reasoning, where humans excel in recognizing deep structural similarities across domains. AI errors primarily stem from superficial matching, while human errors result from misinterpretations of causal structures. The findings suggest a potential division of labor in AI-assisted organizational decision-making, with language models serving as analogy generators and humans as critical evaluators of contextually appropriate analogies. <div>

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models, specifically GPT4, can match human capabilities in analogical reasoning within strategic decision making contexts. Using a novel experimental design involving source to target matching, we find that GPT4 achieves high recall by retrieving all plausible analogies but suffers from low precision, frequently applying incorrect analogies based on superficial similarities. In contrast, human participants exhibit high precision but low recall, selecting fewer analogies yet with stronger causal alignment. These findings advance theory by identifying matching, the evaluative phase of analogical reasoning, as a distinct step that requires accurate causal mapping beyond simple retrieval. While current LLMs are proficient in generating candidate analogies, humans maintain a comparative advantage in recognizing deep structural similarities across domains. Error analysis reveals that AI errors arise from surface level matching, whereas human errors stem from misinterpretations of causal structure. Taken together, the results suggest a productive division of labor in AI assisted organizational decision making where LLMs may serve as broad analogy generators, while humans act as critical evaluators, applying the most contextually appropriate analogies to strategic problems.

Summary:<br /><br />In response to the trust issues surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) for sequential planning, this study presents a Computational Tree Logic-guided large language model (LLM) based framework tailored for the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. MCTS, known for its complexity, is made more interpretable with this framework, capable of addressing a wide array of post-hoc and knowledge-based queries related to MCTS and the Markov Decision Process (MDP) within the domain. By converting user inquiries into logic and variable statements, the framework ensures the factual consistency of evidence gleaned from the search tree with the environmental dynamics and constraints of the stochastic control process. Rigorous evaluation shows the framework's strong performance in terms of accuracy and factual consistency, making it a valuable tool for enhancing trust and understanding in AI sequential planning. <div>

Abstract: In response to the lack of trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for sequential planning, we design a Computational Tree Logic-guided large language model (LLM)-based natural language explanation framework designed for the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. MCTS is often considered challenging to interpret due to the complexity of its search trees, but our framework is flexible enough to handle a wide range of free-form post-hoc queries and knowledge-based inquiries centered around MCTS and the Markov Decision Process (MDP) of the application domain. By transforming user queries into logic and variable statements, our framework ensures that the evidence obtained from the search tree remains factually consistent with the underlying environmental dynamics and any constraints in the actual stochastic control process. We evaluate the framework rigorously through quantitative assessments, where it demonstrates strong performance in terms of accuracy and factual consistency.

Summary:<br />
This position paper highlights the crisis in empirical evaluation in Generative AI, attributing it to traditional ML evaluation methods being inadequate for modern GenAI models. These models often lack well-defined ground truth targets, operate in nearly unbounded input and output spaces, and exhibit feedback loops. Two major challenges, leakage and contamination, are identified as crucial in GenAI evaluations. The paper suggests looking to AI Competitions for effective measures against leakage, as they have developed successful strategies to combat cheating. It advocates for viewing AI Competitions as the standard for empirical rigor in GenAI evaluation and utilizing their results effectively. <div>

Abstract: In this position paper, we observe that empirical evaluation in Generative AI is at a crisis point since traditional ML evaluation and benchmarking strategies are insufficient to meet the needs of evaluating modern GenAI models and systems. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that these models typically have nearly unbounded input and output spaces, typically do not have a well defined ground truth target, and typically exhibit strong feedback loops and prediction dependence based on context of previous model outputs. On top of these critical issues, we argue that the problems of {\em leakage} and {\em contamination} are in fact the most important and difficult issues to address for GenAI evaluations. Interestingly, the field of AI Competitions has developed effective measures and practices to combat leakage for the purpose of counteracting cheating by bad actors within a competition setting. This makes AI Competitions an especially valuable (but underutilized) resource. Now is time for the field to view AI Competitions as the gold standard for empirical rigor in GenAI evaluation, and to harness and harvest their results with according value.

arXiv:2505.00651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of connected vehicles within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem presents critical challenges in ensuring scalable, real-time, and privacy-preserving traffic management. Existing centralized IoV solutions often suffer from high latency, limited scalability, and reliance on proprietary Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, creating significant barriers to widespread deployment, particularly in dynamic and privacy-sensitive environments. Meanwhile, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in vehicular systems remains underexplored, especially concerning prompt optimization and effective utilization in federated contexts. To address these challenges, we propose the Federated Prompt-Optimized Traffic Transformer (FPoTT), a novel framework that leverages open-source LLMs for predictive IoV management. FPoTT introduces a dynamic prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively refines textual prompts to enhance trajectory prediction. The architecture employs a dual-layer federated learning paradigm, combining lightweight edge models for real-time inference with cloud-based LLMs to retain global intelligence. A Transformer-driven synthetic data generator is incorporated to augment training with diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios in the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) format. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FPoTT, utilizing EleutherAI Pythia-1B, achieves 99.86% prediction accuracy on real-world data while maintaining high performance on synthetic datasets. These results underscore the potential of open-source LLMs in enabling secure, adaptive, and scalable IoV management, offering a promising alternative to proprietary solutions in smart mobility ecosystems.

Abstract: We present LangVAE, a novel framework for modular construction of variational autoencoders (VAEs) on top of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). Such language model VAEs can encode the knowledge of their pre-trained components into more compact and semantically disentangled representations. The representations obtained in this way can be analysed with the LangVAE companion framework: LangSpace, which implements a collection of probing methods, such as vector traversal and interpolation, disentanglement measures, and cluster visualisations. LangVAE and LangSpace offer a flexible, efficient and scalable way of building and analysing textual representations, with simple integration for models available on the HuggingFace Hub. Additionally, we conducted a set of experiments with different encoder and decoder combinations, as well as annotated inputs, revealing a wide range of interactions across architectural families and sizes w.r.t. generalisation and disentanglement. Our findings demonstrate a promising framework for systematising the experimentation and understanding of textual representations.

Summary: 
This paper presents evidence that a digital twin of U.S. congresspersons can be created using a virtual model based on language models. A dataset containing all Tweets from every U.S. congressperson is introduced, enabling the generation of Tweets that closely resemble those posted by real politicians. Using these generated Tweets, roll-call vote behaviors can be predicted and the likelihood of congresspersons crossing party lines can be quantified. This information can assist stakeholders in resource allocation and potentially impact legislative dynamics. The study also discusses limitations and potential extensions for this analysis. <div>

Abstract: In this paper we provide evidence that a virtual model of U.S. congresspersons based on a collection of language models satisfies the definition of a digital twin. In particular, we introduce and provide high-level descriptions of a daily-updated dataset that contains every Tweet from every U.S. congressperson during their respective terms. We demonstrate that a modern language model equipped with congressperson-specific subsets of this data are capable of producing Tweets that are largely indistinguishable from actual Tweets posted by their physical counterparts. We illustrate how generated Tweets can be used to predict roll-call vote behaviors and to quantify the likelihood of congresspersons crossing party lines, thereby assisting stakeholders in allocating resources and potentially impacting real-world legislative dynamics. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and important extensions of our analysis.

Summary: 
The study focuses on detecting jailbreaks in Large Language Models (LLMs) used in sensitive domains like education, specifically in the 2-Sigma clinical education platform. Through annotating over 2,300 prompts in 158 conversations, linguistic variables correlating with jailbreak behavior were identified. Predictive models utilizing these linguistic features, including Decision Trees, Fuzzy Logic-based classifiers, Boosting methods, and Logistic Regression, were trained and evaluated. The results indicated that feature-based predictive models outperformed Prompt Engineering, with the Fuzzy Decision Tree showing the best performance. The study highlights the effectiveness and explainability of linguistic-feature-based models for jailbreak detection in educational LLMs. Suggestions were made for future research to explore hybrid frameworks for real-time, spectrum-based jailbreak monitoring in educational contexts.

Abstract: Jailbreaking in Large Language Models (LLMs) threatens their safe use in sensitive domains like education by allowing users to bypass ethical safeguards. This study focuses on detecting jailbreaks in 2-Sigma, a clinical education platform that simulates patient interactions using LLMs. We annotated over 2,300 prompts across 158 conversations using four linguistic variables shown to correlate strongly with jailbreak behavior. The extracted features were used to train several predictive models, including Decision Trees, Fuzzy Logic-based classifiers, Boosting methods, and Logistic Regression. Results show that feature-based predictive models consistently outperformed Prompt Engineering, with the Fuzzy Decision Tree achieving the best overall performance. Our findings demonstrate that linguistic-feature-based models are effective and explainable alternatives for jailbreak detection. We suggest future work explore hybrid frameworks that integrate prompt-based flexibility with rule-based robustness for real-time, spectrum-based jailbreak monitoring in educational LLMs.

Abstract: Background Practical applications such as social media monitoring and customer-feedback analysis require accurate emotion detection for Japanese text, yet resource scarcity and class imbalance hinder model performance.
  Objective This study aims to build a high-accuracy model for predicting the presence or absence of eight Plutchik emotions in Japanese sentences.
  Methods Using the WRIME corpus, we transform reader-averaged intensity scores into binary labels and fine-tune four pre-trained language models (BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3-base, DeBERTa-v3-large). For context, we also assess two large language models (TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct and ChatGPT-4o). Accuracy and F1-score serve as evaluation metrics.
  Results DeBERTa-v3-large attains the best mean accuracy (0.860) and F1-score (0.662), outperforming all other models. It maintains robust F1 across both high-frequency emotions (e.g., Joy, Anticipation) and low-frequency emotions (e.g., Anger, Trust). The LLMs lag, with ChatGPT-4o and TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct scoring 0.527 and 0.292 in mean F1, respectively.
  Conclusion The fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3-large model currently offers the most reliable solution for binary emotion classification in Japanese. We release this model as a pip-installable package (pip install deberta-emotion-predictor). Future work should augment data for rare emotions, reduce model size, and explore prompt engineering to improve LLM performance.

<div> Keywords: Text-to-SQL, large language models, reasoning, tabular data, reinforcement learning
Summary: <br /><br />This work presents a novel approach to the Text-to-SQL task by focusing on teaching large language models (LLMs) to reason and manipulate tabular data. The framework proposed consists of two stages: generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from SQL queries to provide supervision for table reasoning, and introducing a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning objective to encourage generalizable reasoning. The approach improves performance on standard Text-to-SQL benchmarks and shows substantial gains on reasoning-intensive datasets such as BIRD and CRT-QA. The results indicate that leveraging SQL supervision not only enhances accuracy but also promotes robust and transferable reasoning abilities in LLMs when dealing with structured data. The distilled-quantized LLaMA model achieved a 20% increase in accuracy, while Qwen achieved a 5% increase, showcasing the effectiveness of using SQL as a scaffold for learning reasoning over tabular data. <div>

Abstract: This work reframes the Text-to-SQL task as a pathway for teaching large language models (LLMs) to reason over and manipulate tabular data--moving beyond the traditional focus on query generation. We propose a two-stage framework that leverages SQL supervision to develop transferable table reasoning capabilities. First, we synthesize detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from real-world SQL queries, providing step-by-step, clause-level supervision that teaches the model how to traverse, filter, and aggregate table fields. Second, we introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning objective that connects SQL execution accuracy to generalizable reasoning by encouraging steps that extend beyond task-specific syntax and transfer across datasets. Empirically, our approach improves performance on standard Text-to-SQL benchmarks and achieves substantial gains on reasoning-intensive datasets such as BIRD and CRT-QA, demonstrating enhanced generalization and interpretability. Specifically, the distilled-quantized LLaMA model achieved a 20\% increase in accuracy when trained on Text-to-SQL tasks, while Qwen achieved a 5\% increase. These results suggest that SQL can serve not only as a target formalism but also as an effective scaffold for learning robust, transferable reasoning over structured data.

<div> Keywords: Prompt Engineering, Large Language Models, Prompt Compression, Evaluation, Multimodal Tasks

Summary: 
Prompt engineering has been crucial in enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various tasks. However, the use of lengthy prompts has led to increased computational complexity and costs. To address this issue, this study investigates six different methods for compressing prompts for LLMs while maintaining response quality. The evaluation covers various aspects such as generation performance, model hallucinations, efficacy in multimodal tasks, word omission analysis, and more. The experiments conducted across 13 datasets reveal that prompt compression has a more significant impact on LLM performance in longer contexts compared to shorter ones. Surprisingly, in the Longbench evaluation, moderate compression actually improves LLM performance. The code and data for these methods are available on GitHub at https://github.com/3DAgentWorld/Toolkit-for-Prompt-Compression.

Abstract: Prompt engineering enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform a variety of tasks. However, lengthy prompts significantly increase computational complexity and economic costs. To address this issue, we study six prompt compression methods for LLMs, aiming to reduce prompt length while maintaining LLM response quality. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis covering aspects such as generation performance, model hallucinations, efficacy in multimodal tasks, word omission analysis, and more. We evaluate these methods across 13 datasets, including news, scientific articles, commonsense QA, math QA, long-context QA, and VQA datasets. Our experiments reveal that prompt compression has a greater impact on LLM performance in long contexts compared to short ones. In the Longbench evaluation, moderate compression even enhances LLM performance. Our code and data is available at https://github.com/3DAgentWorld/Toolkit-for-Prompt-Compression.

<br />Summary:
Using a dataset of copyrighted O'Reilly Media books, the study employs the DE-COP membership inference attack to assess if OpenAI's language models were trained on copyrighted content without authorization. The results indicate that OpenAI's GPT-4o model shows strong recognition of paywalled O'Reilly book content, with an AUROC score of 82%, outperforming the earlier model GPT-3.5 Turbo. In contrast, GPT-3.5 Turbo exhibits better recognition of publicly available O'Reilly book samples. The smaller model GPT-4o Mini shows no knowledge of either public or non-public O'Reilly Media content. The study emphasizes the necessity for enhanced corporate transparency in disclosing pre-training data sources to establish formal licensing frameworks for AI content training. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Using a legally obtained dataset of 34 copyrighted O'Reilly Media books, we apply the DE-COP membership inference attack method to investigate whether OpenAI's large language models were trained on copyrighted content without consent. Our AUROC scores show that GPT-4o, OpenAI's more recent and capable model, demonstrates strong recognition of paywalled O'Reilly book content (AUROC = 82\%), compared to OpenAI's earlier model GPT-3.5 Turbo. In contrast, GPT-3.5 Turbo shows greater relative recognition of publicly accessible O'Reilly book samples. GPT-4o Mini, as a much smaller model, shows no knowledge of public or non-public O'Reilly Media content when tested (AUROC $\approx$ 50\%). Testing multiple models, with the same cutoff date, helps us account for potential language shifts over time that might bias our findings. These results highlight the urgent need for increased corporate transparency regarding pre-training data sources as a means to develop formal licensing frameworks for AI content training

Summary: 
The paper addresses the challenges of imbalanced data distribution in food hazard detection classification tasks by utilizing data augmentation techniques. Transformer-based models BERT and RoBERTa are used as backbone classifiers. Various data balancing strategies including random oversampling, Easy Data Augmentation (EDA), and focal loss are explored. The experiments demonstrate that EDA effectively mitigates class imbalance, leading to significant improvements in accuracy and F1 scores. Combining focal loss with oversampling and EDA enhances model robustness, particularly for difficult-to-classify examples. These findings contribute to the development of more effective NLP-based classification models for food hazard detection. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Our ex- periments show that EDA effectively mitigates class imbalance, leading to significant improve- ments in accuracy and F1 scores. Furthermore, combining focal loss with oversampling and EDA further enhances model robustness, par- ticularly for hard-to-classify examples.

Abstract: Scaling data quantity is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet recent findings show that data quality can significantly boost performance and training efficiency. We introduce a German-language dataset curation pipeline that combines heuristic and model-based filtering techniques with synthetic data generation. We use our pipeline to create Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb, a large-scale German pre-training dataset which draws from: (1) Common Crawl web data, (2) FineWeb2, and (3) synthetically-generated data conditioned on actual, organic web data. We evaluate our dataset by pre-training both a 1B Llama-style model and an 8B tokenizer-free hierarchical autoregressive transformer (HAT). A comparison on German-language benchmarks, including MMMLU, shows significant performance gains of Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb over FineWeb2 alone. This advantage holds at the 8B scale even when FineWeb2 is enriched by human-curated high-quality data sources such as Wikipedia. Our findings support the growing body of evidence that model-based data curation and synthetic data generation can significantly enhance LLM pre-training datasets.

Summary: 

The article discusses the challenges faced by language models in dealing with complex interrelationships in a real-world corpus, including inconsistencies and ambiguities. It introduces Context Organizer (CORG), a framework designed to organize multiple contexts into independently processed groups. The CORG framework consists of three key components: a graph constructor, a reranker, and an aggregator, which work together to efficiently find all relevant answers while ensuring disambiguation. The authors classify interrelationships into four types: distracting, ambiguous, counterfactual, and duplicated, and highlight that existing approaches struggle to address all these complexities simultaneously. The results show that CORG effectively balances performance and efficiency, outperforming existing grouping methods and achieving comparable results to more computationally intensive single-context approaches. <div>

Abstract: In a real-world corpus, knowledge frequently recurs across documents but often contains inconsistencies due to ambiguous naming, outdated information, or errors, leading to complex interrelationships between contexts. Previous research has shown that language models struggle with these complexities, typically focusing on single factors in isolation. We classify these relationships into four types: distracting, ambiguous, counterfactual, and duplicated. Our analysis reveals that no single approach effectively addresses all these interrelationships simultaneously. Therefore, we introduce Context Organizer (CORG), a framework that organizes multiple contexts into independently processed groups. This design allows the model to efficiently find all relevant answers while ensuring disambiguation. CORG consists of three key components: a graph constructor, a reranker, and an aggregator. Our results demonstrate that CORG balances performance and efficiency effectively, outperforming existing grouping methods and achieving comparable results to more computationally intensive, single-context approaches.

Summary:
Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 series of language models utilize rule-based reinforcement learning to enhance tool-use abilities. Unlike previous methods, Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 models are optimized with binary rewards for structural validity and functional correctness of tool invocations. This approach allows the models to internalize reasoning strategies autonomously without annotated reasoning trajectories. Experimental results on BFCL and API-Bank benchmarks show that Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-7B and Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-14B, based on Qwen-2.5-7B/14B-Instruct, outperform GPT-4o, achieving state-of-the-art results in both evaluations. This novel training paradigm provides a lightweight supervision method that improves model generalization and reasoning capabilities, making it a promising approach for extending the functionality of large language models using external tools.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enabling large language models with external tools has become a pivotal strategy for extending their functionality beyond text generation tasks. Prior work typically enhances tool-use abilities by either applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enforce tool-call correctness or distilling reasoning traces from stronger models for SFT. However, both approaches fall short, either omitting reasoning entirely or producing imitative reasoning that limits generalization. Inspired by the success of DeepSeek-R1 in eliciting reasoning through rule-based reinforcement learning, we develop the Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 series of tool-using language models using a similar training paradigm. Instead of restrictively supervising intermediate reasoning traces distilled from stronger models, Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 is optimized with a binary reward that evaluates only the structural validity and functional correctness of tool invocations. This lightweight supervision allows the model to autonomously internalize reasoning strategies, without the need for annotated reasoning trajectories. Experiments on the BFCL and API-Bank benchmarks show that Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-7B and Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-14B, built on Qwen-2.5-7B/14B-Instruct, achieve state-of-the-art results, outperforming GPT-4o on both evaluations.

Abstract: In recent years, despite foundation models like DeepSeek-R1 and ChatGPT demonstrating significant capabilities in general tasks, professional knowledge barriers, computational resource requirements, and deployment environment limitations have severely hindered their application in actual medical scenarios. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient lightweight medical vertical large language model architecture method, systematically solving the lightweight problem of medical large models from three dimensions: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational optimization. At the knowledge acquisition level, a knowledge transfer pipeline is designed from the fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B teacher model to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B student model, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technology is adopted to precisely adjust key attention layers. At the model compression level, compression techniques including 4-bit weight quantization are implemented while preserving the core representation ability for medical reasoning. At the computational optimization level, inference optimization techniques such as Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching are integrated, and a professional prompt template system is constructed to adapt to different types of medical problems. Experimental results on medical question-answering datasets show that the method proposed in this paper maintains professional accuracy while reducing memory consumption by 64.7\% and inference latency by 12.4\%, providing an effective solution for the application of medical large models in resource-constrained environments such as edge computing devices.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM)-the ability to infer and reason about others' mental states-is fundamental to human social intelligence. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, it is crucial to assess and enhance their capacity to interpret and respond to human mental states. In this paper, we review LLMs' ToM capabilities by examining both evaluation benchmarks and the strategies designed to improve them. We focus on widely adopted story-based benchmarks and provide an in-depth analysis of methods aimed at enhancing ToM in LLMs. Furthermore, we outline promising future research directions informed by recent benchmarks and state-of-the-art approaches. Our survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers interested in advancing LLMs' ToM capabilities.

<div> discovering subject dimension, action dimension, object dimension, adverbial dimension, trees<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper introduces an approach that automatically identifies subject, action, object, and adverbial dimensions from texts to enhance text manipulation and facilitate natural language queries. The method constructs high-quality trees to represent these dimensions and their subclass relations, ensuring efficient representation without redundancies. By accessing these trees through a tree-based search mechanism, the proposed approach supports effective querying in natural language. Experimental results show that the abstraction trees' precision, recall, and F1-score exceed 80%. When applied to querying subject or object in texts, the approach demonstrates high coverage of different question patterns and efficiently narrows down the search space by searching multiple trees based on the question pattern. This enables precise text manipulation and targeted sentence retrieval for supporting query operations.<br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper proposed an approach to automatically discovering subject dimension, action dimension, object dimension and adverbial dimension from texts to efficiently operate texts and support query in natural language. The high quality of trees guarantees that all subjects, actions, objects and adverbials and their subclass relations within texts can be represented. The independency of trees ensures that there is no redundant representation between trees. The expressiveness of trees ensures that the majority of sentences can be accessed from each tree and the rest of sentences can be accessed from at least one tree so that the tree-based search mechanism can support querying in natural language. Experiments show that the average precision, recall and F1-score of the abstraction trees constructed by the subclass relations of subject, action, object and adverbial are all greater than 80%. The application of the proposed approach to supporting query in natural language demonstrates that different types of question patterns for querying subject or object have high coverage of texts, and searching multiple trees on subject, action, object and adverbial according to the question pattern can quickly reduce search space to locate target sentences, which can support precise operation on texts.

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end speech-to-speech (S2S) dialogue systems have garnered increasing research attention due to their advantages over traditional cascaded systems, including achieving lower latency and more natural integration of nonverbal cues such as emotion and speaker identity. However, these end-to-end systems face key challenges, particularly in incorporating external knowledge, a capability commonly addressed by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in text-based large language models (LLMs). The core difficulty lies in the modality gap between input speech and retrieved textual knowledge, which hinders effective integration. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end RAG framework that directly retrieves relevant textual knowledge from speech queries, eliminating the need for intermediate speech-to-text conversion via techniques like ASR. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of end-to-end S2S dialogue systems while achieving higher retrieval efficiency. Although the overall performance still lags behind cascaded models, our framework offers a promising direction for enhancing knowledge integration in end-to-end S2S systems. We will release the code and dataset to support reproducibility and promote further research in this area.

Summary:<br />
Structured Dialogue Fine-Tuning (SDFT) is introduced as an approach to inject domain-specific knowledge into Large Vision Language Models while minimizing catastrophic forgetting. The method involves a three-phase dialogue structure: Foundation Preservation, Contrastive Disambiguation, and Knowledge Specialization. SDFT strikes a balance between acquiring specialized knowledge and retaining general capabilities. Key contributions include a data-centric dialogue template, a weighted multi-turn supervision framework, and comprehensive evaluation across diverse knowledge types. Experimental results across multiple domains confirm the effectiveness of SDFT in maintaining foundational alignment while integrating targeted knowledge. <div>

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models have demonstrated impressive versatile capabilities through extensive multimodal pre-training, but face significant limitations when incorporating specialized knowledge domains beyond their training distribution. These models struggle with a fundamental dilemma: direct adaptation approaches that inject domain-specific knowledge often trigger catastrophic forgetting of foundational visual-linguistic abilities. We introduce Structured Dialogue Fine-Tuning (SDFT), an effective approach that effectively injects domain-specific knowledge while minimizing catastrophic forgetting. Drawing inspiration from supervised fine-tuning in LLMs and subject-driven personalization in text-to-image diffusion models, our method employs a three-phase dialogue structure: Foundation Preservation reinforces pre-trained visual-linguistic alignment through caption tasks; Contrastive Disambiguation introduces carefully designed counterfactual examples to maintain semantic boundaries; and Knowledge Specialization embeds specialized information through chain-of-thought reasoning. Experimental results across multiple domains confirm SDFT's effectiveness in balancing specialized knowledge acquisition with general capability retention. Our key contributions include a data-centric dialogue template that balances foundational alignment with targeted knowledge integration, a weighted multi-turn supervision framework, and comprehensive evaluation across diverse knowledge types.

<div> Keywords: large language model, self-training algorithm, anticipatory plans, problem-solving, natural language reasoning

Summary:
LEPA is a novel self-training algorithm for large language models that focuses on generating anticipatory plans before solving problems. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive processes, LEPA aims to capture abstract meta-knowledge essential for generalization. During data generation, LEPA creates anticipatory plans based on the problem and generates solutions aligned with these plans. The algorithm refines these plans through self-reflection to improve solution accuracy. In model optimization, the LLM is trained to predict both the refined plans and corresponding solutions. By extracting and utilizing anticipatory plans efficiently, LEPA outperforms conventional algorithms on challenging natural language reasoning benchmarks. <div>

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) post-training, the effectiveness of utilizing synthetic data generated by the LLM itself has been well-presented. However, a key question remains unaddressed: what essential information should such self-generated data encapsulate? Existing approaches only produce step-by-step problem solutions, and fail to capture the abstract meta-knowledge necessary for generalization across similar problems. Drawing insights from cognitive science, where humans employ high-level abstraction to simplify complex problems before delving into specifics, we introduce a novel self-training algorithm: LEarning to Plan before Answering (LEPA). LEPA trains the LLM to formulate anticipatory plans, which serve as abstract meta-knowledge for problem-solving, before engaging with the intricacies of problems. This approach not only outlines the solution generation path but also shields the LLM from the distraction of irrelevant details. During data generation, LEPA first crafts an anticipatory plan based on the problem, and then generates a solution that aligns with both the plan and the problem. LEPA refines the plan through self-reflection, aiming to acquire plans that are instrumental in yielding correct solutions. During model optimization, the LLM is trained to predict both the refined plans and the corresponding solutions. By efficiently extracting and utilizing the anticipatory plans, LEPA demonstrates remarkable superiority over conventional algorithms on various challenging natural language reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) impacts more than 300 million people worldwide, highlighting a significant public health issue. However, the uneven distribution of medical resources and the complexity of diagnostic methods have resulted in inadequate attention to this disorder in numerous countries and regions. This paper introduces a high-performance MDD diagnosis tool named MDD-LLM, an AI-driven framework that utilizes fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) and extensive real-world samples to tackle challenges in MDD diagnosis. Therefore, we select 274,348 individual information from the UK Biobank cohort to train and evaluate the proposed method. Specifically, we select 274,348 individual records from the UK Biobank cohort and design a tabular data transformation method to create a large corpus for training and evaluating the proposed approach. To illustrate the advantages of MDD-LLM, we perform comprehensive experiments and provide several comparative analyses against existing model-based solutions across multiple evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that MDD-LLM (70B) achieves an accuracy of 0.8378 and an AUC of 0.8919 (95% CI: 0.8799 - 0.9040), significantly outperforming existing machine learning and deep learning frameworks for MDD diagnosis. Given the limited exploration of LLMs in MDD diagnosis, we examine numerous factors that may influence the performance of our proposed method, such as tabular data transformation techniques and different fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on many natural language processing(NLP) tasks and have been employed in phishing email detection research. However, in current studies, well-performing LLMs typically contain billions or even tens of billions of parameters, requiring enormous computational resources. To reduce computational costs, we investigated the effectiveness of small-parameter LLMs for phishing email detection. These LLMs have around 3 billion parameters and can run on consumer-grade GPUs. However, small LLMs often perform poorly in phishing email detection task. To address these issues, we designed a set of methods including Prompt Engineering, Explanation Augmented Fine-tuning, and Model Ensemble to improve phishing email detection capabilities of small LLMs. We validated the effectiveness of our approach through experiments, significantly improving accuracy on the SpamAssassin dataset from around 0.5 for baseline models like Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct to 0.976.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive computational framework for analyzing linguistic complexity and socio-cultural trends in hip-hop lyrics. Using a dataset of 3,814 songs from 146 influential artists spanning four decades (1980-2020), we employ natural language processing techniques to quantify multiple dimensions of lyrical complexity. Our analysis reveals a 23.7% increase in vocabulary diversity over the study period, with East Coast artists demonstrating 17.3% higher lexical variation than other regions. Rhyme density increased by 34.2% across all regions, with Midwest artists exhibiting the highest technical complexity (3.04 rhymes per line). Topic modeling identified significant shifts in thematic content, with social justice themes decreasing from 28.5% to 13.8% of content while introspective themes increased from 7.6% to 26.3%. Sentiment analysis demon- strated that lyrics became significantly more negative during sociopolitical crises, with polarity decreasing by 0.31 following major social unrest. Multi-dimensional analysis revealed four dis- tinct stylistic approaches that correlate strongly with geographic origin (r=0.68, p!0.001) and time period (r=0.59, p<0.001). These findings establish quantitative evidence for the evolution of hip- hop as both an art form and a reflection of societal dynamics, providing insights into the interplay between linguistic innovation and cultural context in popular music.

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of fashion trends and social media sentiment through computational analysis of Twitter data using the T4SA (Twitter for Sentiment Analysis) dataset. By applying natural language processing and machine learning techniques, we examine how sentiment patterns in fashion-related social media conversations can serve as predictors for emerging fashion trends. Our analysis involves the identification and categorization of fashion-related content, sentiment classification with improved normalization techniques, time series decomposition, statistically validated causal relationship modeling, cross-platform sentiment comparison, and brand-specific sentiment analysis. Results indicate correlations between sentiment patterns and fashion theme popularity, with accessories and streetwear themes showing statistically significant rising trends. The Granger causality analysis establishes sustainability and streetwear as primary trend drivers, showing bidirectional relationships with several other themes. The findings demonstrate that social media sentiment analysis can serve as an effective early indicator of fashion trend trajectories when proper statistical validation is applied. Our improved predictive model achieved 78.35% balanced accuracy in sentiment classification, establishing a reliable foundation for trend prediction across positive, neutral, and negative sentiment categories.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in enabling natural language interfaces for structured data querying through text-to-SQL generation. However, their application in real-world Business Intelligence (BI) contexts remains limited due to semantic hallucinations, structural errors, and a lack of domain-specific evaluation frameworks. In this study, we propose a Fact-Consistency Evaluation Framework for assessing the semantic accuracy of LLM-generated SQL outputs using Exaone 3.5--an instruction-tuned, bilingual LLM optimized for enterprise tasks. We construct a domain-specific benchmark comprising 219 natural language business questions across five SQL complexity levels, derived from actual sales data in LG Electronics' internal BigQuery environment. Each question is paired with a gold-standard SQL query and a validated ground-truth answer. We evaluate model performance using answer accuracy, execution success rate, semantic error rate, and non-response rate. Experimental results show that while Exaone 3.5 performs well on simple aggregation tasks (93% accuracy in L1), it exhibits substantial degradation in arithmetic reasoning (4% accuracy in H1) and grouped ranking tasks (31% in H4), with semantic errors and non-responses concentrated in complex cases. Qualitative error analysis further identifies common failure types such as misapplied arithmetic logic, incomplete filtering, and incorrect grouping operations. Our findings highlight the current limitations of LLMs in business-critical environments and underscore the need for fact-consistency validation layers and hybrid reasoning approaches. This work contributes a reproducible benchmark and evaluation methodology for advancing reliable natural language interfaces to structured enterprise data systems.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms to perform complex tasks in urban environments, system design now faces major challenges, including efficient semantic understanding, flexible task planning, and the ability to dynamically adjust coordination strategies in response to evolving environmental conditions and continuously changing task requirements. To address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper proposes coordination field agentic system for coordinating heterogeneous UAV swarms in complex urban scenarios. In this system, large language models (LLMs) is responsible for interpreting high-level human instructions and converting them into executable commands for the UAV swarms, such as patrol and target tracking. Subsequently, a Coordination field mechanism is proposed to guide UAV motion and task selection, enabling decentralized and adaptive allocation of emergent tasks. A total of 50 rounds of comparative testing were conducted across different models in a 2D simulation space to evaluate their performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior performance in terms of task coverage, response time, and adaptability to dynamic changes.

Summary:<br />
The study examines the impact of the AI-Lab intervention on undergraduate students at Purdue University, focusing on their learning, skill development, and perceptions of GenAI. The intervention, emphasizing guided scaffolding and mindful engagement, was integrated into various courses over three semesters. Results showed positive shifts in students' attitudes and usage patterns towards GenAI, particularly in conceptual understanding, debugging, and homework tasks. The intervention helped students adopt a more mindful and deliberate approach to using GenAI tools. Focus group discussions supported these findings, indicating that the intervention facilitated a more reflective integration of GenAI into coursework. Recommendations are provided for educators looking to incorporate GenAI into computing curricula in a responsible manner, highlighting the importance of structured interventions to enhance student awareness and skill development.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly entering computer science education, yet its effects on student learning, skill development, and perceptions remain underexplored. Concerns about overreliance coexist with a gap in research on structured scaffolding to guide tool use in formal courses. This study examines the impact of a dedicated "AI-Lab" intervention -- emphasizing guided scaffolding and mindful engagement -- on undergraduate students in Data Structures and Algorithms, Competitive Programming, and first-year engineering courses at Purdue University.
  Over three semesters, we integrated AI-Lab modules into four mandatory and elective courses, yielding 831 matched pre- and post-intervention survey responses, alongside focus group discussions. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed quantitative shifts in usage patterns and attitudes as well as qualitative narratives of student experiences.
  While the overall frequency of GenAI usage for homework or programming projects remained largely stable, we observed large effect sizes in comfort and openness across conceptual, debugging, and homework problems. Notably, usage patterns for debugging also shifted statistically significantly, reflecting students' more mindful and deliberate approach. Focus group discussions corroborated these results, suggesting that the intervention "bridged the gap" between naive GenAI usage and more nuanced, reflective integration of AI tools into coursework, ultimately heightening students' awareness of their own skill development.
  These findings suggest that structured, scaffolded interventions can enable students to harness GenAI's benefits without undermining essential competencies. We offer evidence-based recommendations for educators seeking to integrate GenAI responsibly into computing curricula and identify avenues for future research on GenAI-supported pedagogy.

Summary: 
This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translating the low-resource Lebanese dialect, comparing the impact of culturally authentic data with larger translated datasets. Three fine-tuning approaches - Basic, contrastive, and grammar-hint tuning - were evaluated using open-source Aya23 models. Results show that models fine-tuned on a culturally aware Lebanese dataset outperform those trained on larger non-native data. The best performance was seen with contrastive fine-tuning and prompting, suggesting exposure to bad examples is beneficial. A new benchmark, LebEval, derived from native Lebanese content was introduced and compared to the FLoRes benchmark for authentic evaluation. The study challenges the belief that "More Data is Better" and highlights the importance of cultural authenticity in dialectal translation. Datasets and code are available on Github. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

We compare three fine-tuning approaches: Basic, contrastive, and grammar-hint tuning, using open-source Aya23 models. Experiments reveal that models fine-tuned on a smaller but culturally aware Lebanese dataset (LW) consistently outperform those trained on larger, non-native data. The best results were achieved through contrastive fine-tuning paired with contrastive prompting, which indicates the benefits of exposing translation models to bad examples. In addition, to ensure authentic evaluation, we introduce LebEval, a new benchmark derived from native Lebanese content, and compare it to the existing FLoRes benchmark. Our findings challenge the "More Data is Better" paradigm and emphasize the crucial role of cultural authenticity in dialectal translation. We made our datasets and code available on Github.

<div> overthinking, reasoning length, answer correctness, model calibration, length reduction <br />
Summary: <br />
The study focuses on large language models (LLMs) and their reasoning behavior regarding response length and answer correctness. It found that LLMs tend to overthink simple problems, leading to unnecessarily long outputs, while underthinking harder ones, resulting in a failure to extend reasoning when needed. This suggests a misjudgment of problem difficulty and a lack of appropriate calibrating responses. The study also explored the effects of length reduction on response generation through a preference optimization algorithm. Experiments showed that significantly reducing generation length while maintaining acceptable accuracy is possible. The findings emphasize generation length as a crucial factor in understanding LLMs' reasoning behavior and call for further research on models' self-awareness in adapting reasoning length. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly optimized for long reasoning, under the assumption that more reasoning leads to better performance. However, emerging evidence suggests that longer responses can sometimes degrade accuracy rather than improve it. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study of the relationship between reasoning length and answer correctness. We find that LLMs tend to overthink simple problems, generating unnecessarily long outputs, and underthink harder ones, failing to extend their reasoning when it is most needed. This indicates that models might misjudge problem difficulty and fail to calibrate their response length appropriately. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of length reduction with a preference optimization algorithm when simply preferring the shorter responses regardless of answer correctness. Experiments show that the generation length can be significantly reduced while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Our findings highlight generation length as a meaningful signal for reasoning behavior and motivate further exploration into LLMs' self-awareness in reasoning length adaptation.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel method of utilizing task-based C++ code with an asynchronous runtime model HPX in Python through pybind11 for creating a parallel Gaussian process (GP) library, GPRat. The library aims to combine the ease of use of existing GP libraries with high performance and scalability. Performance evaluation on a mass-spring-damper system shows minimal overhead in binding the asynchronous HPX code using pybind11. Compared to GPyTorch and GPflow, GPRat demonstrates superior scaling on up to 64 cores for training and achieves significant prediction speedups. Specifically, GPRat achieves a speedup of 7.63 over GPyTorch and 25.25 over GPflow for prediction, with even greater speedups observed when increasing the number of features. These findings highlight the effectiveness of utilizing asynchronous tasks in Python-based AI applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Python is the de-facto language for software development in artificial intelligence (AI). Commonly used libraries, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, rely on parallelization built into their BLAS backends to achieve speedup on CPUs. However, only applying parallelization in a low-level backend can lead to performance and scaling degradation. In this work, we present a novel way of binding task-based C++ code built on the asynchronous runtime model HPX to a high-level Python API using pybind11. We develop a parallel Gaussian process (GP) li- brary as an application. The resulting Python library GPRat combines the ease of use of commonly available GP libraries with the performance and scalability of asynchronous runtime systems. We evaluate the per- formance on a mass-spring-damper system, a standard benchmark from control theory, for varying numbers of regressors (features). The results show almost no binding overhead when binding the asynchronous HPX code using pybind11. Compared to GPyTorch and GPflow, GPRat shows superior scaling on up to 64 cores on an AMD EPYC 7742 CPU for train- ing. Furthermore, our library achieves a prediction speedup of 7.63 over GPyTorch and 25.25 over GPflow. If we increase the number of features from eight to 128, we observe speedups of 29.62 and 21.19, respectively. These results showcase the potential of using asynchronous tasks within Python-based AI applications.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the challenges posed by the misuse of social media platforms for disseminating hate speech through multimodal memes. It introduces a novel approach using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to detect and mitigate hateful content in memes. The study presents a definition-guided prompting technique for identifying hateful memes and proposes the UnHateMeme framework to transform such content by replacing offensive components with non-hateful alternatives. The integration of VLMs within UnHateMeme demonstrates promising results in converting hateful memes while maintaining coherence between text and visuals. The research evaluates the performance of pretrained VLMs like LLaVA, Gemini, and GPT-4o in detecting and mitigating hate speech in memes, highlighting their strengths and limitations. This work emphasizes the importance of leveraging VLMs to promote online safety and respectful communication on social media platforms.<br /> <div>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of social media has provided enhanced communication channels for individuals to create online content, enabling them to express their thoughts and opinions. Multimodal memes, often utilized for playful or humorous expressions with visual and textual elements, are sometimes misused to disseminate hate speech against individuals or groups. While the detection of hateful memes is well-researched, developing effective methods to transform hateful content in memes remains a significant challenge. Leveraging the powerful generation and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we address the tasks of detecting and mitigating hateful content. This paper presents two key contributions: first, a definition-guided prompting technique for detecting hateful memes, and second, a unified framework for mitigating hateful content in memes, named UnHateMeme, which works by replacing hateful textual and/or visual components. With our definition-guided prompts, VLMs achieve impressive performance on hateful memes detection task. Furthermore, our UnHateMeme framework, integrated with VLMs, demonstrates a strong capability to convert hateful memes into non-hateful forms that meet human-level criteria for hate speech and maintain multimodal coherence between image and text. Through empirical experiments, we show the effectiveness of state-of-the-art pretrained VLMs such as LLaVA, Gemini and GPT-4o on the proposed tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of their respective strengths and limitations for these tasks. This paper aims to shed light on important applications of VLMs for ensuring safe and respectful online environments.

Abstract: Deep generative models have shown significant promise in generating valid 3D molecular structures, with the GEOM-Drugs dataset serving as a key benchmark. However, current evaluation protocols suffer from critical flaws, including incorrect valency definitions, bugs in bond order calculations, and reliance on force fields inconsistent with the reference data.

<div> Embeddings, attention mechanisms, deep learning, Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, recurrence prediction<br />
Summary:<br />
A deep learning framework incorporating vector embeddings and attention mechanisms is proposed to improve Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) recurrence prediction. The model utilizes embeddings for categorical variables to capture complex relationships and enhance prediction performance. It achieves 70% accuracy with tabular data, surpassing traditional methods and offering patient-specific insights through feature attention. Clinicians can identify influential factors contributing to recurrence risk for each patient. Additionally, the model uncovers new important factors like surgical duration and hospital stay, enhancing existing prediction models for NMIBC. This approach addresses the limitations of current clinical prediction tools, providing more accurate and personalized insights to improve patient management in NMIBC. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.00171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a relentless challenge in oncology, with recurrence rates soaring as high as 70-80%. Each recurrence triggers a cascade of invasive procedures, lifelong surveillance, and escalating healthcare costs - affecting 460,000 individuals worldwide. However, existing clinical prediction tools remain fundamentally flawed, often overestimating recurrence risk and failing to provide personalized insights for patient management. In this work, we propose an interpretable deep learning framework that integrates vector embeddings and attention mechanisms to improve NMIBC recurrence prediction performance. We incorporate vector embeddings for categorical variables such as smoking status and intravesical treatments, allowing the model to capture complex relationships between patient attributes and recurrence risk. These embeddings provide a richer representation of the data, enabling improved feature interactions and enhancing prediction performance. Our approach not only enhances performance but also provides clinicians with patient-specific insights by highlighting the most influential features contributing to recurrence risk for each patient. Our model achieves accuracy of 70% with tabular data, outperforming conventional statistical methods while providing clinician-friendly patient-level explanations through feature attention. Unlike previous studies, our approach identifies new important factors influencing recurrence, such as surgical duration and hospital stay, which had not been considered in existing NMIBC prediction models.

Summary: 
Proto-objects, regions with shared visual properties, provide a new approach to attention mechanisms in neural networks. By utilizing image segmentation and working with higher-level features, we reduce representational complexity and encode proto-objects as compact feature vectors. This enables a smaller self-attention module that processes richer semantic information. Our experiments show that the proto-object-based approach matches or surpasses patch-based implementations with fewer parameters and less training time. This signifies the potential of proto-objects in advancing visual tasks in neural networks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Proto-objects - image regions that share common visual properties - offer a promising alternative to traditional attention mechanisms based on rectangular-shaped image patches in neural networks. Although previous work demonstrated that evolving a patch-based hard-attention module alongside a controller network could achieve state-of-the-art performance in visual reinforcement learning tasks, our approach leverages image segmentation to work with higher-level features. By operating on proto-objects rather than fixed patches, we significantly reduce the representational complexity: each image decomposes into fewer proto-objects than regular patches, and each proto-object can be efficiently encoded as a compact feature vector. This enables a substantially smaller self-attention module that processes richer semantic information. Our experiments demonstrate that this proto-object-based approach matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art performance of patch-based implementations with 62% less parameters and 2.6 times less training time.

Summary:
Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) utilize dictionary learning to extract meaningful features in a computationally intensive manner. A study reveals the power-law distribution of dictionary importance in SAEs. A comparison between progressive coding through subset pruning and Matryoshka SAEs on a language modeling task indicates that Matryoshka SAEs outperform in terms of reconstruction and language modeling loss, as well as representational similarity. However, pruned vanilla SAEs offer enhanced interpretability. The trade-off between interpretability and performance in SAEs raises important considerations for application and model design. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) \citep{bricken2023monosemanticity,gao2024scalingevaluatingsparseautoencoders} rely on dictionary learning to extract interpretable features from neural networks at scale in an unsupervised manner, with applications to representation engineering and information retrieval. SAEs are, however, computationally expensive \citep{lieberum2024gemmascopeopensparse}, especially when multiple SAEs of different sizes are needed. We show that dictionary importance in vanilla SAEs follows a power law. We compare progressive coding based on subset pruning of SAEs -- to jointly training nested SAEs, or so-called {\em Matryoshka} SAEs \citep{bussmann2024learning,nabeshima2024Matryoshka} -- on a language modeling task. We show Matryoshka SAEs exhibit lower reconstruction loss and recaptured language modeling loss, as well as higher representational similarity. Pruned vanilla SAEs are more interpretable, however. We discuss the origins and implications of this trade-off.

<title>Online Federation For Mixtures of Proprietary Agents with Black-Box Encoders</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.00216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most industry-standard generative AIs and feature encoders are proprietary, offering only black-box access: their outputs are observable, but their internal parameters and architectures remain hidden from the end-user. This black-box access is especially limiting when constructing mixture-of-expert type ensemble models since the user cannot optimize each proprietary AI's internal parameters. Our problem naturally lends itself to a non-competitive game-theoretic lens where each proprietary AI (agent) is inherently competing against the other AI agents, with this competition arising naturally due to their obliviousness of the AI's to their internal structure. In contrast, the user acts as a central planner trying to synchronize the ensemble of competing AIs.
  We show the existence of the unique Nash equilibrium in the online setting, which we even compute in closed-form by eliciting a feedback mechanism between any given time series and the sequence generated by each (proprietary) AI agent. Our solution is implemented as a decentralized, federated-learning algorithm in which each agent optimizes their structure locally on their machine without ever releasing any internal structure to the others. We obtain refined expressions for pre-trained models such as transformers, random feature models, and echo-state networks. Our ``proprietary federated learning'' algorithm is implemented on a range of real-world and synthetic time-series benchmarks. It achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in predictive accuracy over natural benchmarks, of which there are surprisingly few due to this natural problem still being largely unexplored.

Abstract: The development of novel autonomous underwater gliders has been hindered by limited shape diversity, primarily due to the reliance on traditional design tools that depend heavily on manual trial and error. Building an automated design framework is challenging due to the complexities of representing glider shapes and the high computational costs associated with modeling complex solid-fluid interactions. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced automated computational framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling the creation of underwater robots with non-trivial hull shapes. Our approach involves an algorithm that co-optimizes both shape and control signals, utilizing a reduced-order geometry representation and a differentiable neural-network-based fluid surrogate model. This end-to-end design workflow facilitates rapid iteration and evaluation of hydrodynamic performance, leading to the discovery of optimal and complex hull shapes across various control settings. We validate our method through wind tunnel experiments and swimming pool gliding tests, demonstrating that our computationally designed gliders surpass manually designed counterparts in terms of energy efficiency. By addressing challenges in efficient shape representation and neural fluid surrogate models, our work paves the way for the development of highly efficient underwater gliders, with implications for long-range ocean exploration and environmental monitoring.

<title>Predicting Estimated Times of Restoration for Electrical Outages Using Longitudinal Tabular Transformers</title>

Abstract: As climate variability increases, the ability of utility providers to deliver precise Estimated Times of Restoration (ETR) during natural disasters has become increasingly critical. Accurate and timely ETRs are essential for enabling customer preparedness during extended power outages, where informed decision-making can be crucial, particularly in severe weather conditions. Nonetheless, prevailing utility practices predominantly depend on manual assessments or traditional statistical methods, which often fail to achieve the level of precision required for reliable and actionable predictions. To address these limitations, we propose a Longitudinal Tabular Transformer (LTT) model that leverages historical outage event data along with sequential updates of these events to improve the accuracy of ETR predictions. The model's performance was evaluated over 34,000 storm-related outage events from three major utility companies, collectively serving over 3 million customers over a 2-year period. Results demonstrate that the LTT model improves the Customer Satisfaction Impact (CSI) metric by an average of 19.08% (p > 0.001) compared to existing methods. Additionally, we introduce customer-informed regression metrics that align model evaluation with real-world satisfaction, ensuring the outcomes resonate with customer expectations. Furthermore, we employ interpretability techniques to analyze the temporal significance of incorporating sequential updates in modeling outage events and to identify the contributions of predictive features to a given ETR. This comprehensive approach not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency, fostering greater trust in the model's capabilities.

Abstract: Driven by the advancements in generative AI, large machine learning models have revolutionized domains such as image processing, audio synthesis, and speech recognition. While server-based deployments remain the locus of peak performance, the imperative for on-device inference, necessitated by privacy and efficiency considerations, persists. Recognizing GPUs as the on-device ML accelerator with the widest reach, we present ML Drift--an optimized framework that extends the capabilities of state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated inference engines. ML Drift enables on-device execution of generative AI workloads which contain 10 to 100x more parameters than existing on-device generative AI models. ML Drift addresses intricate engineering challenges associated with cross-GPU API development, and ensures broad compatibility across mobile and desktop/laptop platforms, thereby facilitating the deployment of significantly more complex models on resource-constrained devices. Our GPU-accelerated ML/AI inference engine achieves an order-of-magnitude performance improvement relative to existing open-source GPU inference engines.

Abstract: AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly pivotal across diverse domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific, predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical scenarios. The recent emergence of Video-Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively, significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an accuracy of 75.8%.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has evolved as a prominent solution for compressing complex models, which advocates a small calibration dataset and avoids end-to-end retraining. However, most existing PTQ methods employ block-wise reconstruction, which neglects cross-block dependency and exhibits a notable accuracy drop in low-bit cases. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel PTQ method, dubbed Pack-PTQ. First, we design a Hessian-guided adaptive packing mechanism to partition blocks into non-overlapping packs, which serve as the base unit for reconstruction, thereby preserving the cross-block dependency and enabling accurate quantization parameters estimation. Second, based on the pack configuration, we propose a mixed-precision quantization approach to assign varied bit-widths to packs according to their distinct sensitivities, thereby further enhancing performance. Extensive experiments on 2D image and 3D point cloud classification tasks, using various network architectures, demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art PTQ methods.

Abstract: The hallmark of effective language use lies in consistency -- expressing similar meanings in similar contexts and avoiding contradictions. While human communication naturally demonstrates this principle, state-of-the-art language models struggle to maintain reliable consistency across different scenarios. This paper examines the landscape of consistency research in AI language systems, exploring both formal consistency (including logical rule adherence) and informal consistency (such as moral and factual coherence). We analyze current approaches to measure aspects of consistency, identify critical research gaps in standardization of definitions, multilingual assessment, and methods to improve consistency. Our findings point to an urgent need for robust benchmarks to measure and interdisciplinary approaches to ensure consistency in the application of language models on domain-specific tasks while preserving the utility and adaptability.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for end-to-end autonomous driving. However, fully exploiting their capabilities for safe and reliable vehicle control remains an open research challenge. To systematically examine advances and limitations of VLMs in driving tasks, we introduce LightEMMA, a Lightweight End-to-End Multimodal Model for Autonomous driving. LightEMMA provides a unified, VLM-based autonomous driving framework without ad hoc customizations, enabling easy integration and evaluation of evolving state-of-the-art commercial and open-source models. We construct twelve autonomous driving agents using various VLMs and evaluate their performance on the nuScenes prediction task, comprehensively assessing metrics such as inference time, computational cost, and predictive accuracy. Illustrative examples highlight that, despite their strong scenario interpretation capabilities, VLMs' practical performance in autonomous driving tasks remains concerning, emphasizing the need for further improvements.

Abstract: Molecular odor prediction is the process of using a molecule's structure to predict its smell. While accurate prediction remains challenging, AI models can suggest potential odors. Existing methods, however, often rely on basic descriptors or handcrafted fingerprints, which lack expressive power and hinder effective learning. Furthermore, these methods suffer from severe class imbalance, limiting the training effectiveness of AI models. To address these challenges, we propose a Feature Contribution-driven Hierarchical Multi-Feature Mapping Network (HMFNet). Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained, Local Multi-Hierarchy Feature Extraction module (LMFE) that performs deep feature extraction at the atomic level, capturing detailed features crucial for odor prediction. To enhance the extraction of discriminative atomic features, we integrate a Harmonic Modulated Feature Mapping (HMFM). This module dynamically learns feature importance and frequency modulation, improving the model's capability to capture relevant patterns. Additionally, a Global Multi-Hierarchy Feature Extraction module (GMFE) is designed to learn global features from the molecular graph topology, enabling the model to fully leverage global information and enhance its discriminative power for odor prediction. To further mitigate the issue of class imbalance, we propose a Chemically-Informed Loss (CIL). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves performance across various deep learning models, highlighting its potential to advance molecular structure representation and accelerate the development of AI-driven technologies.

Abstract: Gas leaks pose significant risks to human health and the environment. Despite long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation. Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation, we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

Abstract: Purpose: This study presents a Deep Learning (DL)-based quality assessment (QA) approach for evaluating auto-generated contours (auto-contours) in radiotherapy, with emphasis on Online Adaptive Radiotherapy (OART). Leveraging Bayesian Ordinal Classification (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds, the method enables confident QA predictions without relying on ground truth contours or extensive manual labeling. Methods: We developed a BOC model to classify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A calibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical accuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual labels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate cancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent, transfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were available. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all scenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34 subjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated threshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted in over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting cases needing correction. Conclusion: The proposed QA model enhances contouring efficiency in OART by reducing manual workload and enabling fast, informed clinical decisions. Through uncertainty quantification, it ensures safer, more reliable radiotherapy workflows.

Abstract: The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM previously used to investigate \textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. The surrogate model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps, MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to CPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts model of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning to serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster evaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater spatial and temporal scales.

Abstract: This paper introduces an AI-enabled, interaction-aware active safety analysis framework that accounts for groupwise vehicle interactions. Specifically, the framework employs a bicycle model-augmented with road gradient considerations-to accurately capture vehicle dynamics. In parallel, a hypergraph-based AI model is developed to predict probabilistic trajectories of ambient traffic. By integrating these two components, the framework derives vehicle intra-spacing over a 3D road surface as the solution of a stochastic ordinary differential equation, yielding high-fidelity surrogate safety measures such as time-to-collision (TTC). To demonstrate its effectiveness, the framework is analyzed using stochastic numerical methods comprising 4th-order Runge-Kutta integration and AI inference, generating probability-weighted high-fidelity TTC (HF-TTC) distributions that reflect complex multi-agent maneuvers and behavioral uncertainties. Evaluated with HF-TTC against traditional constant-velocity TTC and non-interaction-aware approaches on highway datasets, the proposed framework offers a systematic methodology for active safety analysis with enhanced potential for improving safety perception in complex traffic environments.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INR) has found successful applications across diverse domains. To employ INR in real-life, it is important to speed up training. In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art approach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a faster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid usage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant use of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter efficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a parametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video representation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework that can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the spatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information, NVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter efficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels at once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video quality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed increase of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters) and an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic), compared to previous grid-type works. By expanding this to compression tasks, we demonstrate comparable performance to video compression standards (H.264, HEVC) and recent INR approaches for video compression. Additionally, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithm across diverse tasks, encompassing super resolution, frame interpolation and video inpainting.

Abstract: Text-to-video generative models have made significant strides in recent years, producing high-quality videos that excel in both aesthetic appeal and accurate instruction following, and have become central to digital art creation and user engagement online. Yet, despite these advancements, their ability to respect fundamental physical laws remains largely untested: many outputs still violate basic constraints such as rigid-body collisions, energy conservation, and gravitational dynamics, resulting in unrealistic or even misleading content. Existing physical-evaluation benchmarks typically rely on automatic, pixel-level metrics applied to simplistic, life-scenario prompts, and thus overlook both human judgment and first-principles physics. To fill this gap, we introduce \textbf{T2VPhysBench}, a first-principled benchmark that systematically evaluates whether state-of-the-art text-to-video systems, both open-source and commercial, obey twelve core physical laws including Newtonian mechanics, conservation principles, and phenomenological effects. Our benchmark employs a rigorous human evaluation protocol and includes three targeted studies: (1) an overall compliance assessment showing that all models score below 0.60 on average in each law category; (2) a prompt-hint ablation revealing that even detailed, law-specific hints fail to remedy physics violations; and (3) a counterfactual robustness test demonstrating that models often generate videos that explicitly break physical rules when so instructed. The results expose persistent limitations in current architectures and offer concrete insights for guiding future research toward truly physics-aware video generation.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming education, presenting unprecedented opportunities for personalized learning and streamlined content creation. However, realizing the full potential of AI in educational settings necessitates careful consideration of the quality, cognitive depth, and ethical implications of AI-generated materials. This paper synthesizes insights from four related studies to propose a comprehensive framework for enhancing AI-driven educational tools. We integrate cognitive assessment frameworks (Bloom's Taxonomy and SOLO Taxonomy), linguistic analysis of AI-generated feedback, and ethical design principles to guide the development of effective and responsible AI tools. We outline a structured three-phase approach encompassing cognitive alignment, linguistic feedback integration, and ethical safeguards. The practical application of this framework is demonstrated through its integration into OneClickQuiz, an AI-powered Moodle plugin for quiz generation. This work contributes a comprehensive and actionable guide for educators, researchers, and developers aiming to harness AI's potential while upholding pedagogical and ethical standards in educational content generation.

Abstract: The explosion in model sizes leads to continued growth in prohibitive training/fine-tuning costs, particularly for stateful optimizers which maintain auxiliary information of even 2x the model size to achieve optimal convergence. We therefore present in this work a novel type of optimizer that carries with extremely lightweight state overloads, achieved through ultra-low-precision quantization. While previous efforts have achieved certain success with 8-bit or 4-bit quantization, our approach enables optimizers to operate at precision as low as 3 bits, or even 2 bits per state element. This is accomplished by identifying and addressing two critical challenges: the signal swamping problem in unsigned quantization that results in unchanged state dynamics, and the rapidly increased gradient variance in signed quantization that leads to incorrect descent directions. The theoretical analysis suggests a tailored logarithmic quantization for the former and a precision-specific momentum value for the latter. Consequently, the proposed SOLO achieves substantial memory savings (approximately 45 GB when training a 7B model) with minimal accuracy loss. We hope that SOLO can contribute to overcoming the bottleneck in computational resources, thereby promoting greater accessibility in fundamental research.

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices necessitates effective model com- pression strategies that judiciously balance the reduction of model size with the preservation of performance. This study introduces a novel safety-driven quantization framework that leverages preservation sets to systematically prune and quantize neural network weights, thereby optimizing model complexity without compromising accuracy. The proposed methodology is rigorously evaluated on both a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an attention-based language model, demonstrating its applicability across diverse architectural paradigms. Experimental results reveal that our framework achieves up to a 2.5% enhancement in test accuracy relative to the original unquantized models while maintaining 60% of the initial model size. In comparison to conventional quantization techniques, our approach not only augments generalization by eliminating parameter noise and retaining essential weights but also reduces variance, thereby ensuring the retention of critical model features. These findings underscore the efficacy of safety-driven quantization as a robust and reliable strategy for the efficient optimization of deep learn- ing models. The implementation and comprehensive experimental evaluations of our framework are publicly accessible at GitHub.

Abstract: Data mixing strategies have successfully reduced the costs involved in training language models. While promising, such methods suffer from two flaws. First, they rely on predetermined data domains (e.g., data sources, task types), which may fail to capture critical semantic nuances, leaving performance on the table. Second, these methods scale with the number of domains in a computationally prohibitive way. We address these challenges via R&amp;B, a framework that re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity (Regroup) to create finer-grained domains, and efficiently optimizes the data composition (Balance) by leveraging a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients obtained throughout training. Unlike prior works, it removes the need for additional compute to obtain evaluation information such as losses or gradients. We analyze this technique under standard regularity conditions and provide theoretical insights that justify R&amp;B's effectiveness compared to non-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of R&amp;B on five diverse datasets ranging from natural language to reasoning and multimodal tasks. With as little as 0.01% additional compute overhead, R&amp;B matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art data mixing strategies.

Abstract: In data stream clustering, systematic theory of stream clustering algorithms remains relatively scarce. Recently, density-based methods have gained attention. However, existing algorithms struggle to simultaneously handle arbitrarily shaped, multi-density, high-dimensional data while maintaining strong outlier resistance. Clustering quality significantly deteriorates when data density varies complexly. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based on the novel concept of Tightest Neighbors and introduces a data stream clustering theory based on the Skeleton Set. Based on these theories, this paper develops a new method, TNStream, a fully online algorithm. The algorithm adaptively determines the clustering radius based on local similarity, summarizing the evolution of multi-density data streams in micro-clusters. It then applies a Tightest Neighbors-based clustering algorithm to form final clusters. To improve efficiency in high-dimensional cases, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is employed to structure micro-clusters, addressing the challenge of storing k-nearest neighbors. TNStream is evaluated on various synthetic and real-world datasets using different clustering metrics. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving clustering quality for multi-density data and validate the proposed data stream clustering theory.

Abstract: The proliferation of end devices has led to a distributed computing paradigm, wherein on-device machine learning models continuously process diverse data generated by these devices. The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by continuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device models. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling machine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is unsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this context, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution, preserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative updates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor autonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial tasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL employs an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and task-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining lightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices. Moreover, $\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an autonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new task has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately allows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without additional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive experiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and THUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\rm{SacFL}$ in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios. Furthermore, a demo system has been developed to verify its practicality.

Abstract: Cognitive distortion refers to negative thinking patterns that can lead to mental health issues like depression and anxiety in adolescents. Previous studies using natural language processing (NLP) have focused mainly on small-scale adult datasets, with limited research on adolescents. This study introduces KoACD, the first large-scale dataset of cognitive distortions in Korean adolescents, containing 108,717 instances. We applied a multi-Large Language Model (LLM) negotiation method to refine distortion classification and generate synthetic data using two approaches: cognitive clarification for textual clarity and cognitive balancing for diverse distortion representation. Validation through LLMs and expert evaluations showed that while LLMs classified distortions with explicit markers, they struggled with context-dependent reasoning, where human evaluators demonstrated higher accuracy. KoACD aims to enhance future research on cognitive distortion detection.

<title>Learning to Estimate Package Delivery Time in Mixed Imbalanced Delivery and Pickup Logistics Services</title>

Abstract: Accurately estimating package delivery time is essential to the logistics industry, which enables reasonable work allocation and on-time service guarantee. This becomes even more necessary in mixed logistics scenarios where couriers handle a high volume of delivery and a smaller number of pickup simultaneously. However, most of the related works treat the pickup and delivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the pickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the delivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three main challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately interconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups have stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it challenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers' spatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior, but have been insufficiently explored. To deal with these, we propose TransPDT, a Transformer-based multi-task package delivery time prediction model. We first employ the Transformer encoder architecture to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies of couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets. Then we design the pattern memory to learn the patterns of pickup in the imbalanced dataset via attention mechanism. We also set the route prediction as an auxiliary task of delivery time prediction, and incorporate the prior courier spatial movement regularities in prediction. Extensive experiments on real industry-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. A system based on TransPDT is deployed internally in JD Logistics to track more than 2000 couriers handling hundreds of thousands of packages per day in Beijing.

Abstract: Prediction of couriers' delivery timely rates in advance is essential to the logistics industry, enabling companies to take preemptive measures to ensure the normal operation of delivery services. This becomes even more critical during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers' delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly. Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by 12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over multiple competitive baselines.

Abstract: Automatic anonymization techniques are essential for ethical sharing of pathological speech data, yet their perceptual consequences remain understudied. This study presents the first comprehensive human-centered analysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured perceptual protocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse linguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated anonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and Palate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and age-matched healthy controls. Speech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error rates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination and quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot (repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91% zero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA: p=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization consistently reduced perceived quality (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with pathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native listeners rated original speech slightly higher than non-native listeners (Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference nearly disappeared after anonymization (Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Critically, human perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic privacy or clinical utility metrics. These results underscore the need for listener-informed, disorder- and context-specific anonymization strategies that preserve privacy while maintaining interpretability, communicative functions, and diagnostic utility, especially for vulnerable populations such as children.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that successful per-domain generalizing action policies can be learned. Scaling behavior, from small training instances to large test instances, is the key objective; and the use of validation instances larger than training instances is one key to achieve it. Prior work has used fixed validation sets. Here, we introduce a method generating the validation set dynamically, on the fly, increasing instance size so long as informative and feasible.We also introduce refined methodology for evaluating scaling behavior, generating test instances systematically to guarantee a given confidence in coverage performance for each instance size. In experiments, dynamic validation improves scaling behavior of GNN policies in all 9 domains used.

Abstract: Effective data visualization requires not only technical proficiency but also a deep understanding of the domain-specific context in which data exists. This context often includes tacit knowledge about data provenance, quality, and intended use, which is rarely explicit in the dataset itself. We present the Data Therapist, a web-based tool that helps domain experts externalize this implicit knowledge through a mixed-initiative process combining iterative Q&amp;A with interactive annotation. Powered by a large language model, the system analyzes user-supplied datasets, prompts users with targeted questions, and allows annotation at varying levels of granularity. The resulting structured knowledge base can inform both human and automated visualization design. We evaluated the tool in a qualitative study involving expert pairs from Molecular Biology, Accounting, Political Science, and Usable Security. The study revealed recurring patterns in how experts reason about their data and highlights areas where AI support can improve visualization design.

Abstract: We present the design process and findings of the pre-conference workshop at the Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference (2024) entitled Red Teaming Large Language Models for Healthcare, which took place on August 15, 2024. Conference participants, comprising a mix of computational and clinical expertise, attempted to discover vulnerabilities -- realistic clinical prompts for which a large language model (LLM) outputs a response that could cause clinical harm. Red-teaming with clinicians enables the identification of LLM vulnerabilities that may not be recognised by LLM developers lacking clinical expertise. We report the vulnerabilities found, categorise them, and present the results of a replication study assessing the vulnerabilities across all LLMs provided.

Abstract: We present JointDiT, a diffusion transformer that models the joint distribution of RGB and depth. By leveraging the architectural benefit and outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e., adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality, and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply controlling the timestep of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint distribution modeling can serve as a replaceable alternative to conditional generation.

Abstract: This article describes the process of creating a script and conducting an analytical study of a dataset using the DeepMIMO emulator. An advertorial attack was carried out using the FGSM method to maximize the gradient. A comparison is made of the effectiveness of binary classifiers in the task of detecting distorted data. The dynamics of changes in the quality indicators of the regression model were analyzed in conditions without adversarial attacks, during an adversarial attack and when the distorted data was isolated. It is shown that an adversarial FGSM attack with gradient maximization leads to an increase in the value of the MSE metric by 33% and a decrease in the R2 indicator by 10% on average. The LightGBM binary classifier effectively identifies data with adversarial anomalies with 98% accuracy. Regression machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, but rapid analysis of network traffic and data transmitted over the network makes it possible to identify malicious activity

<title>MULE: Multi-terrain and Unknown Load Adaptation for Effective Quadrupedal Locomotion</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00488</link>

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots are increasingly deployed for load-carrying tasks across diverse terrains. While Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based methods can account for payload variations, they often depend on predefined gait schedules or trajectory generators, limiting their adaptability in unstructured environments. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that enables quadrupedal robots to dynamically adapt to both varying payloads and diverse terrains. The framework consists of a nominal policy responsible for baseline locomotion and an adaptive policy that learns corrective actions to preserve stability and improve command tracking under payload variations. We validate the proposed approach through large-scale simulation experiments in Isaac Gym and real-world hardware deployment on a Unitree Go1 quadruped. The controller was tested on flat ground, slopes, and stairs under both static and dynamic payload changes. Across all settings, our adaptive controller consistently outperformed the controller in tracking body height and velocity commands, demonstrating enhanced robustness and adaptability without requiring explicit gait design or manual tuning.

Abstract: Collaborative robots must continually adapt to novel tasks and user preferences without overburdening the user. While prior interactive robot learning methods aim to reduce human effort, they are typically limited to single-task scenarios and are not well-suited for sustained, multi-task collaboration. We propose COIL (Cost-Optimal Interactive Learning) -- a multi-task interaction planner that minimizes human effort across a sequence of tasks by strategically selecting among three query types (skill, preference, and help). When user preferences are known, we formulate COIL as an uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problem, which enables bounded-suboptimal planning in polynomial time using off-the-shelf approximation algorithms. We extend our formulation to handle uncertainty in user preferences by incorporating one-step belief space planning, which uses these approximation algorithms as subroutines to maintain polynomial-time performance. Simulated and physical experiments on manipulation tasks show that our framework significantly reduces the amount of work allocated to the human while maintaining successful task completion.

<title>Variational OOD State Correction for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.00503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of Offline reinforcement learning is significantly impacted by the issue of state distributional shift, and out-of-distribution (OOD) state correction is a popular approach to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Density-Aware Safety Perception (DASP) for OOD state correction. Specifically, our method encourages the agent to prioritize actions that lead to outcomes with higher data density, thereby promoting its operation within or the return to in-distribution (safe) regions. To achieve this, we optimize the objective within a variational framework that concurrently considers both the potential outcomes of decision-making and their density, thus providing crucial contextual information for safe decision-making. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed method through extensive experimental evaluations on the offline MuJoCo and AntMaze suites.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, detecting hallucinated content$\unicode{x2013}$text that is not grounded in supporting evidence$\unicode{x2013}$has become a critical challenge. Existing benchmarks for hallucination detection are often synthetically generated, narrowly focused on extractive question answering, and fail to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios involving multi-document contexts and full-sentence outputs. We introduce the HalluMix Benchmark, a diverse, task-agnostic dataset that includes examples from a range of domains and formats. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven hallucination detection systems$\unicode{x2013}$both open and closed source$\unicode{x2013}$highlighting differences in performance across tasks, document lengths, and input representations. Our analysis highlights substantial performance disparities between short and long contexts, with critical implications for real-world Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) implementations. Quotient Detections achieves the best overall performance, with an accuracy of 0.82 and an F1 score of 0.84.

Abstract: Safety-critical traffic simulation plays a crucial role in evaluating autonomous driving systems under rare and challenging scenarios. However, existing approaches often generate unrealistic scenarios due to insufficient consideration of physical plausibility and suffer from low generation efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a guided latent diffusion model (LDM) capable of generating physically realistic and adversarial safety-critical traffic scenarios. Specifically, our model employs a graph-based variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a compact latent space that captures complex multi-agent interactions while improving computational efficiency. Within this latent space, the diffusion model performs the denoising process to produce realistic trajectories. To enable controllable and adversarial scenario generation, we introduce novel guidance objectives that drive the diffusion process toward producing adversarial and behaviorally realistic driving behaviors. Furthermore, we develop a sample selection module based on physical feasibility checks to further enhance the physical plausibility of the generated scenarios. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior adversarial effectiveness and generation efficiency compared to existing baselines while maintaining a high level of realism. Our work provides an effective tool for realistic safety-critical scenario simulation, paving the way for more robust evaluation of autonomous driving systems.

<title>Test-time Correlation Alignment</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks often experience performance drops due to distribution shifts between training and test data. Although domain adaptation offers a solution, privacy concerns restrict access to training data in many real-world scenarios. This restriction has spurred interest in Test-Time Adaptation (TTA), which adapts models using only unlabeled test data. However, current TTA methods still face practical challenges: (1) a primary focus on instance-wise alignment, overlooking CORrelation ALignment (CORAL) due to missing source correlations; (2) complex backpropagation operations for model updating, resulting in overhead computation and (3) domain forgetting.
  To address these challenges, we provide a theoretical analysis to investigate the feasibility of Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA), demonstrating that correlation alignment between high-certainty instances and test instances can enhance test performances with a theoretical guarantee. Based on this, we propose two simple yet effective algorithms: LinearTCA and LinearTCA+. LinearTCA applies a simple linear transformation to achieve both instance and correlation alignment without additional model updates, while LinearTCA+ serves as a plug-and-play module that can easily boost existing TTA methods. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical insights and show that TCA methods significantly outperforms baselines across various tasks, benchmarks and backbones. Notably, LinearTCA improves adaptation accuracy by 5.88% on OfficeHome dataset, while using only 4% maximum GPU memory usage and 0.6% computation time compared to the best baseline TTA method.

<title>On the Mechanistic Interpretability of Neural Networks for Causality in Bio-statistics</title>

Abstract: Interpretable insights from predictive models remain critical in bio-statistics, particularly when assessing causality, where classical statistical and machine learning methods often provide inherent clarity. While Neural Networks (NNs) offer powerful capabilities for modeling complex biological data, their traditional "black-box" nature presents challenges for validation and trust in high-stakes health applications. Recent advances in Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aim to decipher the internal computations learned by these networks. This work investigates the application of MI techniques to NNs within the context of causal inference for bio-statistics.
  We demonstrate that MI tools can be leveraged to: (1) probe and validate the internal representations learned by NNs, such as those estimating nuisance functions in frameworks like Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (TMLE); (2) discover and visualize the distinct computational pathways employed by the network to process different types of inputs, potentially revealing how confounders and treatments are handled; and (3) provide methodologies for comparing the learned mechanisms and extracted insights across statistical, machine learning, and NN models, fostering a deeper understanding of their respective strengths and weaknesses for causal bio-statistical analysis.

<title>Triggering Hallucinations in LLMs: A Quantitative Study of Prompt-Induced Hallucination in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) present a growing challenge across real-world applications, from healthcare to law, where factual reliability is essential. Despite advances in alignment and instruction tuning, LLMs can still generate outputs that are fluent yet fundamentally untrue. Understanding the cognitive dynamics that underlie these hallucinations remains an open problem. In this study, we propose a prompt-based framework to systematically trigger and quantify hallucination: a Hallucination-Inducing Prompt (HIP), which synthetically fuses semantically distant concepts (e.g., periodic table of elements and tarot divination) in a misleading way, and a Hallucination Quantifying Prompt (HQP), which scores the plausibility, confidence, and coherence of the output. Controlled experiments across multiple LLMs revealed that HIPs consistently produced less coherent and more hallucinated responses than their null-fusion controls. These effects varied across models, with reasoning-oriented LLMs showing distinct profiles from general-purpose ones. Our framework provides a reproducible testbed for studying hallucination vulnerability, and opens the door to developing safer, more introspective LLMs that can detect and self-regulate the onset of conceptual instability.

Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA) promise efficient solutions to classically intractable combinatorial optimization problems by harnessing shallow-depth quantum circuits. Yet, their performance and scalability often hinge on effective parameter optimization, which remains nontrivial due to rugged energy landscapes and hardware noise. In this work, we introduce a quantum meta-learning framework that combines quantum neural networks, specifically Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) architectures, with QAOA. By training the QLSTM optimizer on smaller graph instances, our approach rapidly generalizes to larger, more complex problems, substantially reducing the number of iterations required for convergence. Through comprehensive benchmarks on Max-Cut and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model instances, we demonstrate that QLSTM-based optimizers converge faster and achieve higher approximation ratios compared to classical baselines, thereby offering a robust pathway toward scalable quantum optimization in the NISQ era.

Abstract: Learning to solve complex tasks with signal temporal logic (STL) specifications is crucial to many real-world applications. However, most previous works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to the lack of a diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal logic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF, Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We identify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we show our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and robustness to out-distribution STL specifications. Code is available at https://github.com/mengyuest/TeLoGraF

<title>Multimodal Masked Autoencoder Pre-training for 3D MRI-Based Brain Tumor Analysis with Missing Modalities</title>

Abstract: Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) constitutes the first line of investigation for clinicians in the care of brain tumors, providing crucial insights for surgery planning, treatment monitoring, and biomarker identification. Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models learn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This behavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often scarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a challenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are available during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing modalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or specific experimental designs on small in-house datasets. Consequently, a common approach involves training a separate model for each desired modality combination, making the process both resource-intensive and impractical for clinical use. Therefore, we introduce BM-MAE, a masked image modeling pre-training strategy tailored for multimodal MRI data. The same pre-trained model seamlessly adapts to any combination of available modalities, extracting rich representations that capture both intra- and inter-modal information. This allows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural changes, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of modalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-training strategy outperforms or remains competitive with baselines that require separate pre-training for each modality subset, while substantially surpassing training from scratch on several downstream tasks. Additionally, it can quickly and efficiently reconstruct missing modalities, highlighting its practical value. Code and trained models are available at: https://github.com/Lucas-rbnt/bmmae

Abstract: Extending the context window in large language models (LLMs) is essential for applications involving long-form content generation. However, the linear increase in key-value (KV) cache memory requirements and the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length present significant challenges during fine-tuning and inference. Existing methods suffer from performance degradation when extending to longer contexts. In this work, we introduce a novel context extension method that optimizes both fine-tuning and inference efficiency. Our method exploits a key observation: in the frequency domain, the energy distribution of the KV cache is primarily concentrated in low-frequency components. By filtering out the high-frequency components, the KV cache can be effectively compressed with minimal information loss. Building on this insight, we propose an efficient compression technique, FreqKV, that iteratively compresses the increasing KV cache to a fixed size in the frequency domain, applicable to both fine-tuning and inference. FreqKV introduces no additional parameters or architectural modifications. With minimal fine-tuning, LLMs can learn to leverage the limited cache that is compressed in the frequency domain and extend the context window efficiently. Experiments on various long context language modeling and understanding tasks demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method.

Abstract: Detecting and tracking objects is a crucial component of any autonomous navigation method. For the past decades, object detection has yielded promising results using neural networks on various datasets. While many methods focus on performance metrics, few projects focus on improving the robustness of these detection and tracking pipelines, notably to sensor failures. In this paper we attempt to address this issue by creating a realistic synthetic data augmentation pipeline for camera-radar Autonomous Vehicle (AV) datasets. Our goal is to accurately simulate sensor failures and data deterioration due to real-world interferences. We also present our results of a baseline lightweight Noise Recognition neural network trained and tested on our augmented dataset, reaching an overall recognition accuracy of 54.4\% on 11 categories across 10086 images and 2145 radar point-clouds.

DetMCVI solves large problems with a high success rate, outperforming existing baselines for DetPOMDPs. We also verify the performance of the algorithm in a real-world mobile robot forest mapping scenario.

Abstract: We propose the first unified adversarial attack benchmark for Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs), named GERM. Unlike existing GFM benchmarks, GERM offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely adopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our benchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM vulnerabilities with respect to model architecture, quantization schemes, and training datasets. Empirically, transformer-based models exhibit greater robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to HyenaDNA, highlighting the impact of architectural design on vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.

Abstract: We address the 3D reconstruction of human faces from a single RGB image. To this end, we propose Pixel3DMM, a set of highly-generalized vision transformers which predict per-pixel geometric cues in order to constrain the optimization of a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). We exploit the latent features of the DINO foundation model, and introduce a tailored surface normal and uv-coordinate prediction head. We train our model by registering three high-quality 3D face datasets against the FLAME mesh topology, which results in a total of over 1,000 identities and 976K images. For 3D face reconstruction, we propose a FLAME fitting opitmization that solves for the 3DMM parameters from the uv-coordinate and normal estimates. To evaluate our method, we introduce a new benchmark for single-image face reconstruction, which features high diversity facial expressions, viewing angles, and ethnicities. Crucially, our benchmark is the first to evaluate both posed and neutral facial geometry. Ultimately, our method outperforms the most competitive baselines by over 15% in terms of geometric accuracy for posed facial expressions.

Abstract: As machine learning is increasingly deployed in autonomous systems, verification of neural network controllers is becoming an active research domain. Existing tools and annual verification competitions suggest that soon this technology will become effective for real-world applications. Our application comes from the emerging field of microflyers that are passively transported by the wind, which may have various uses in weather or pollution monitoring. Specifically, we investigate centimetre-scale bio-inspired gliding drones that resemble Alsomitra macrocarpa diaspores. In this paper, we propose a new case study on verifying Alsomitra-inspired drones with neural network controllers, with the aim of adhering closely to a target trajectory. We show that our system differs substantially from existing VNN and ARCH competition benchmarks, and show that a combination of tools holds promise for verifying such systems in the future, if certain shortcomings can be overcome. We propose a novel method for robust training of regression networks, and investigate formalisations of this case study in Vehicle and CORA. Our verification results suggest that the investigated training methods do improve performance and robustness of neural network controllers in this application, but are limited in scope and usefulness. This is due to systematic limitations of both Vehicle and CORA, and the complexity of our system reducing the scale of reachability, which we investigate in detail. If these limitations can be overcome, it will enable engineers to develop safe and robust technologies that improve people's lives and reduce our impact on the environment.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch requires significant computational resources, driving interest in developing smaller, domain-specific LLMs that maintain both efficiency and strong task performance. Medium-sized models such as LLaMA, llama} have served as starting points for domain-specific adaptation, but they often suffer from accuracy degradation when tested on specialized datasets. We introduce FineScope, a framework for deriving compact, domain-optimized LLMs from larger pretrained models. FineScope leverages the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) framework, inspired by its ability to produce interpretable feature representations, to extract domain-specific subsets from large datasets. We apply structured pruning with domain-specific constraints, ensuring that the resulting pruned models retain essential knowledge for the target domain. To further enhance performance, these pruned models undergo self-data distillation, leveraging SAE-curated datasets to restore key domain-specific information lost during pruning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that FineScope achieves highly competitive performance, outperforming several large-scale state-of-the-art LLMs in domain-specific tasks. Additionally, our results show that FineScope enables pruned models to regain a substantial portion of their original performance when fine-tuned with SAE-curated datasets. Furthermore, applying these datasets to fine-tune pretrained LLMs without pruning also improves their domain-specific accuracy, highlighting the robustness of our approach. The code will be released.

<title>The Illusion of Role Separation: Hidden Shortcuts in LLM Role Learning (and How to Fix Them)</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that integrate multiple input roles (e.g., system instructions, user queries, external tool outputs) are increasingly prevalent in practice. Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes messages from each role -- a concept we call \emph{role separation} -- is crucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets state-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such methods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known triggers. In this paper, we examine \emph{role-separation learning}: the process of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens. Through a \emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that fine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task type exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data augmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to iterative patching rather than a deeper fix. To address this, we propose reinforcing \emph{invariant signals} that mark role boundaries by adjusting token-wise cues in the model's input encoding. In particular, manipulating position IDs helps the model learn clearer distinctions and reduces reliance on superficial proxies. By focusing on this mechanism-centered perspective, our work illuminates how LLMs can more reliably maintain consistent multi-role behavior without merely memorizing known prompts or triggers.

<title>Deep Learning Assisted Outer Volume Removal for Highly-Accelerated Real-Time Dynamic MRI</title>

Abstract: Real-time (RT) dynamic MRI plays a vital role in capturing rapid physiological processes, offering unique insights into organ motion and function. Among these applications, RT cine MRI is particularly important for functional assessment of the heart with high temporal resolution. RT imaging enables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial alternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold, ECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine MRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues, particularly at high undersampling factors. In this study, we propose a novel outer volume removal (OVR) method to address this challenge by eliminating aliasing contributions from non-cardiac regions in a post-processing framework. Our approach estimates the outer volume signal for each timeframe using composite temporal images from time-interleaved undersampling patterns, which inherently contain pseudo-periodic ghosting artifacts. A deep learning (DL) model is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean outer volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding k-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL (PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high spatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed method at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable to clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach provides a practical and effective solution for artifact reduction in RT cine MRI without requiring acquisition modifications, offering a pathway to higher acceleration rates while preserving diagnostic quality.

Abstract: Unsupervised learning of disease subtypes from multi-omics data presents a significant opportunity for advancing personalized medicine. We introduce OmicsCL, a modular contrastive learning framework that jointly embeds heterogeneous omics modalities-such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression-into a unified latent space. Our method incorporates a survival-aware contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn representations aligned with survival-related patterns, without relying on labeled outcomes. Evaluated on the TCGA BRCA dataset, OmicsCL uncovers clinically meaningful clusters and achieves strong unsupervised concordance with patient survival. The framework demonstrates robustness across hyperparameter configurations and can be tuned to prioritize either subtype coherence or survival stratification. Ablation studies confirm that integrating survival-aware loss significantly enhances the predictive power of learned embeddings. These results highlight the promise of contrastive objectives for biological insight discovery in high-dimensional, heterogeneous omics data.

Abstract: A lively ongoing debate is taking place, since the extraordinary emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with regards to their capability to understand the world and capture the meaning of the dialogues in which they are involved. Arguments and counter-arguments have been proposed based upon thought experiments, anecdotal conversations between LLMs and humans, statistical linguistic analysis, philosophical considerations, and more. In this brief paper we present a counter-argument based upon a thought experiment and semi-formal considerations leading to an inherent ambiguity barrier which prevents LLMs from having any understanding of what their amazingly fluent dialogues mean.

<title>On the generalization of language models from in-context learning and finetuning: a controlled study</title>

Abstract: Large language models exhibit exciting capabilities, yet can show surprisingly narrow generalization from finetuning -- from failing to generalize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, to missing logical deductions that can be made from trained information. These failures to generalize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models. However, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases, and can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based learning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and improve models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are constructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining, to create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context, or through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that require various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched settings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning (though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of knowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning data. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of our datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for understanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language models, and practically improving their performance.

<title>DeepCritic: Deliberate Critique with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving, providing accurate feedback and scalable oversight on their outputs becomes an urgent and critical problem. Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is a promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math critique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too shallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and struggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct mistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage framework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on each reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for supervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise critiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth critiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform reinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing human-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained via Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize its critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct not only significantly outperforms existing LLM critics (including the same-sized DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o) on various error identification benchmarks, but also more effectively helps the LLM generator refine erroneous steps through more detailed feedback.

Abstract: We introduce Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), an actor-critic algorithm for reinforcement learning in continuous action spaces. WPO can be derived as an approximation to Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of all policies projected into a finite-dimensional parameter space (e.g., the weights of a neural network), leading to a simple and completely general closed-form update. The resulting algorithm combines many properties of deterministic and classic policy gradient methods. Like deterministic policy gradients, it exploits knowledge of the gradient of the action-value function with respect to the action. Like classic policy gradients, it can be applied to stochastic policies with arbitrary distributions over actions -- without using the reparameterization trick. We show results on the DeepMind Control Suite and a magnetic confinement fusion task which compare favorably with state-of-the-art continuous control methods.

<title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Urban Air Quality Management: Multi-Objective Optimization of Pollution Mitigation Booth Placement in Metropolitan Environments</title>

Abstract: Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in densely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where exposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm, to iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple spatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic patterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is benchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and greedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation metrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic impact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based approach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective distribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework achieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage deployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions. The findings underscore the potential of AI-driven spatial optimization in advancing smart city initiatives and data-driven urban air quality management.

Abstract: We introduce RegionFocus, a visual test-time scaling approach for Vision Language Model Agents. Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual complexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making accurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on relevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy. To support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes key landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables the agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple region selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\% on Screenspot-pro and 24+\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two state-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive settings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\% on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by applying RegionFocus to a Qwen2.5-VL-72B model. Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/tiangeluo/RegionFocus.

Abstract: Micromobility, which utilizes lightweight mobile machines moving in urban public spaces, such as delivery robots and mobility scooters, emerges as a promising alternative to vehicular mobility. Current micromobility depends mostly on human manual operation (in-person or remote control), which raises safety and efficiency concerns when navigating busy urban environments full of unpredictable obstacles and pedestrians. Assisting humans with AI agents in maneuvering micromobility devices presents a viable solution for enhancing safety and efficiency. In this work, we present a scalable urban simulation solution to advance autonomous micromobility. First, we build URBAN-SIM - a high-performance robot learning platform for large-scale training of embodied agents in interactive urban scenes. URBAN-SIM contains three critical modules: Hierarchical Urban Generation pipeline, Interactive Dynamics Generation strategy, and Asynchronous Scene Sampling scheme, to improve the diversity, realism, and efficiency of robot learning in simulation. Then, we propose URBAN-BENCH - a suite of essential tasks and benchmarks to gauge various capabilities of the AI agents in achieving autonomous micromobility. URBAN-BENCH includes eight tasks based on three core skills of the agents: Urban Locomotion, Urban Navigation, and Urban Traverse. We evaluate four robots with heterogeneous embodiments, such as the wheeled and legged robots, across these tasks. Experiments on diverse terrains and urban structures reveal each robot's strengths and limitations.

Abstract: Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot interaction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic control introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity. To address these limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic representation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows, circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for RoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from 2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable 3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to effectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating significant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements. Code and Datasets in this paper will be released soon.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance. However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.

Abstract: Rooted in the explosion of deep learning over the past decade, this thesis spans from AlphaGo to ChatGPT to empirically examine the fundamental concepts needed to realize the vision of an artificial scientist: a machine with the capacity to autonomously generate original research and contribute to the expansion of human knowledge. The investigation begins with Olivaw, an AlphaGo Zero-like agent that discovers Othello knowledge from scratch but is unable to communicate it. This realization leads to the development of the Explanatory Learning (EL) framework, a formalization of the problem faced by a scientist when trying to explain a new phenomenon to their peers. The effective EL prescriptions allow us to crack Zendo, a popular board game simulating the scientific endeavor. This success comes with a fundamental insight: an artificial scientist must develop its own interpretation of the language used to explain its findings, and not rely on a rigid existing interpreter. Questioning the very process of learning an interpreter, we turn our attention to the inner functioning of modern multimodal models. This culminates in a simple idea to build CLIP-like models where interpretation and perception are explicitly disentangled: a cost-effective approach that couples two unimodal models using little multimodal data and no further training. Finally, we discuss what ChatGPT and its siblings are still missing to become artificial scientists, and introduce the Big-Bench Symbol Interpretation Task, a benchmark about interpreting Zendo-like explanations that sees LLMs going no further than random chance while being instead fully solved by humans.

Abstract: Robustness of reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models, and addressing it is essential for the practical applicability of AI-driven reasoning systems. We introduce Semantic Self-Verification (SSV), a novel approach that addresses the key challenge in combining language models with the rigor of logical solvers: to accurately formulate the reasoning problem from natural language to the formal language of the solver. SSV uses a consistency-based approach to produce strong abstract formalizations of problems using concrete instantiations that are generated by the model and verified by the solver. In addition to significantly advancing the overall reasoning accuracy over the state-of-the-art, a key novelty that this approach presents is a feature of verification that has near-perfect precision over a significant coverage of cases, as we demonstrate on open reasoning benchmarks. We propose such *near-certain reasoning* as a new approach to reduce the need for manual verification in many cases, taking us closer to more dependable and autonomous AI reasoning systems.

Abstract: Current molecular understanding approaches predominantly focus on the descriptive aspect of human perception, providing broad, topic-level insights. However, the referential aspect -- linking molecular concepts to specific structural components -- remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a molecular grounding benchmark designed to evaluate a model's referential abilities. We align molecular grounding with established conventions in NLP, cheminformatics, and molecular science, showcasing the potential of NLP techniques to advance molecular understanding within the AI for Science movement. Furthermore, we constructed the largest molecular understanding benchmark to date, comprising 117k QA pairs, and developed a multi-agent grounding prototype as proof of concept. This system outperforms existing models, including GPT-4o, and its grounding outputs have been integrated to enhance traditional tasks such as molecular captioning and ATC (Anatomical, Therapeutic, Chemical) classification.

Abstract: Recent advances in digital platforms generate rich, high-dimensional logs of human behavior, and machine learning models have helped social scientists explain knowledge accumulation, communication, and information diffusion. Such models, however, almost always treat behavior as sequences of actions, abstracting the inter-temporal information among actions. To close this gap, we introduce a two-scale Action-Timing Context(ATC) framework that jointly embeds each action and its time interval. ATC obtains low-dimensional representations of actions and characterizes them with inter-temporal information. We provide three applications of ATC to real-world datasets and demonstrate that the method offers a unified view of human behavior. The presented qualitative findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling inter-temporal context is essential for a comprehensive, interpretable understanding of human activity on digital platforms.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a general estimation methodology for learning a model of human perception and control in a sensorimotor control task based upon a finite set of demonstrations. The model's structure consists of i the agent's internal representation of how the environment and associated observations evolve as a result of control actions and ii the agent's preferences over observable outcomes. We consider a model's structure specification consistent with active inference, a theory of human perception and behavior from cognitive science. According to active inference, the agent acts upon the world so as to minimize surprise defined as a measure of the extent to which an agent's current sensory observations differ from its preferred sensory observations. We propose a bi-level optimization approach to estimation which relies on a structural assumption on prior distributions that parameterize the statistical accuracy of the human agent's model of the environment. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we present the estimation of a model for car-following behavior based upon a naturalistic dataset. Overall, the results indicate that learning active inference models of human perception and control from data is a promising alternative to black-box models of driving.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various tasks, but they rely on carefully crafted prompts that often demand substantial human effort. To automate this process, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for discrete prompt optimization, called EvoPrompt, which borrows the idea of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as they exhibit good performance and fast convergence. To enable EAs to work on discrete prompts, which are natural language expressions that need to be coherent and human-readable, we connect LLMs with EAs. This approach allows us to simultaneously leverage the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs and the efficient optimization performance of EAs. Specifically, abstaining from any gradients or parameters, EvoPrompt starts from a population of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts with LLMs based on the evolutionary operators, improving the population based on the development set. We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, on 31 datasets covering language understanding, generation tasks, as well as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks. EvoPrompt significantly outperforms human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt generation (e.g., up to 25% on BBH). Furthermore, EvoPrompt demonstrates that connecting LLMs with EAs creates synergies, which could inspire further research on the combination of LLMs and conventional algorithms.

Abstract: We explore "omitted label contexts," in which training data is limited to a subset of the possible labels. This setting is standard among specialized human experts or specific, focused studies. By studying Simpson's paradox, we observe that ``correct'' adjustments sometimes require non-exchangeable treatment and control groups. A generalization of Simpson's paradox leads us to study networks of conclusions drawn from different contexts, within which a paradox of nontransitivity arises. We prove that the space of possible nontransitive structures in these networks exactly corresponds to structures that form from aggregating ranked-choice votes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have shown promising performance on various tasks. However, due to the huge model sizes, running them in resource-constrained environments where the GPU memory is not abundant is challenging. Some existing systems propose to use CPU resources to solve that, but they either suffer from the significant overhead of frequently moving data between CPU and GPU, or fail to consider distinct characteristics of CPUs and GPUs. This paper proposes Fiddler, a resource-efficient inference system for MoE models with limited GPU resources. Fiddler strategically utilizes CPU and GPU resources by determining the optimal execution strategy. Our evaluation shows that, unlike state-of-the-art systems that optimize for specific scenarios such as single batch inference or long prefill, Fiddler performs better in all scenarios. Compared against different baselines, Fiddler achieves 1.26 times speed up in single batch inference, 1.30 times in long prefill processing, and 11.57 times in beam search inference. The code of Fiddler is publicly available at https://github.com/efeslab/fiddler.

<title>LoRATK: LoRA Once, Backdoor Everywhere in the Share-and-Play Ecosystem</title>

Abstract: Finetuning LLMs with LoRA has gained significant popularity due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Often, users may even find pluggable, community-shared LoRAs to enhance their base models for a specific downstream task of interest; enjoying a powerful, efficient, yet customized LLM experience with negligible investment. However, this convenient share-and-play ecosystem also introduces a new attack surface, where attackers can distribute malicious LoRAs to a community eager to try out shared assets. Despite the high-risk potential, no prior art has comprehensively explored LoRA's attack surface under the downstream-enhancing share-and-play context. In this paper, we investigate how backdoors can be injected into task-enhancing LoRAs and examine the mechanisms of such infections. We find that with a simple, efficient, yet specific recipe, a backdoor LoRA can be trained once and then seamlessly merged (in a training-free fashion) with multiple task-enhancing LoRAs, retaining both its malicious backdoor and benign downstream capabilities. This allows attackers to scale the distribution of compromised LoRAs with minimal effort by leveraging the rich pool of existing shared LoRA assets. We note that such merged LoRAs are particularly infectious -- because their malicious intent is cleverly concealed behind improved downstream capabilities, creating a strong incentive for voluntary download -- and dangerous -- because under local deployment, no safety measures exist to intervene when things go wrong. Our work is among the first to study this new threat model of training-free distribution of downstream-capable-yet-backdoor-injected LoRAs, highlighting the urgent need for heightened security awareness in the LoRA ecosystem. Warning: This paper contains offensive content and involves a real-life tragedy.

<title>Large Language Model Agent as a Mechanical Designer</title>

Abstract: Conventional mechanical design follows an iterative process in which initial concepts are refined through cycles of expert assessment and resource-intensive Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis to meet performance goals. While machine learning models have been developed to assist in parts of this process, they typically require large datasets, extensive training, and are often tailored to specific tasks, limiting their generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a framework that leverages a pretrained Large Language Model (LLM) in conjunction with an FEM module to autonomously generate, evaluate, and refine structural designs based on performance specifications and numerical feedback. The LLM operates without domain-specific fine-tuning, using general reasoning to propose design candidates, interpret FEM-derived performance metrics, and apply structurally sound modifications. Using 2D truss structures as a testbed, we show that the LLM can effectively navigate highly discrete and multi-faceted design spaces, balance competing objectives, and identify convergence when further optimization yields diminishing returns. Compared to Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), our method achieves faster convergence and fewer FEM evaluations. Experiments with varying temperature settings (0.5, 1.0, 1.2) and model sizes (GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1-mini) indicate that smaller models yield higher constraint satisfaction with fewer steps, while lower temperatures enhance design consistency. These results establish LLMs as a promising new class of reasoning-based, natural language-driven optimizers for autonomous design and iterative structural refinement.

<title>QServe: W4A8KV4 Quantization and System Co-design for Efficient LLM Serving</title>

Abstract: Quantization can accelerate large language model (LLM) inference. Going beyond INT8 quantization, the research community is actively exploring even lower precision, such as INT4. Nonetheless, state-of-the-art INT4 quantization techniques only accelerate low-batch, edge LLM inference, failing to deliver performance gains in large-batch, cloud-based LLM serving. We uncover a critical issue: existing INT4 quantization methods suffer from significant runtime overhead (20-90%) when dequantizing either weights or partial sums on GPUs. To address this challenge, we introduce QoQ, a W4A8KV4 quantization algorithm with 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache. QoQ stands for quattuor-octo-quattuor, which represents 4-8-4 in Latin. QoQ is implemented by the QServe inference library that achieves measured speedup. The key insight driving QServe is that the efficiency of LLM serving on GPUs is critically influenced by operations on low-throughput CUDA cores. Building upon this insight, in QoQ algorithm, we introduce progressive quantization that can allow low dequantization overhead in W4A8 GEMM. Additionally, we develop SmoothAttention to effectively mitigate the accuracy degradation incurred by 4-bit KV quantization. In the QServe system, we perform compute-aware weight reordering and take advantage of register-level parallelism to reduce dequantization latency. We also make fused attention memory-bound, harnessing the performance gain brought by KV4 quantization. As a result, QServe improves the maximum achievable serving throughput of Llama-3-8B by 1.2x on A100, 1.4x on L40S; and Qwen1.5-72B by 2.4x on A100, 3.5x on L40S, compared to TensorRT-LLM. Remarkably, QServe on L40S GPU can achieve even higher throughput than TensorRT-LLM on A100. Thus, QServe effectively reduces the dollar cost of LLM serving by 3x.

Abstract: In this work, we present a generalized formulation of the Transformer algorithm by reinterpreting its core mechanisms within the framework of Path Integral formalism. In this perspective, the attention mechanism is recast as a process that integrates all possible transition paths leading to future token states, with temporal evolution governed by the Feed-Forward Network. By systematically mapping each component of the Transformer to its counterpart in the Path Integral formulation, we obtain a more compact and efficient representation, in which the contextual information of a sequence is condensed into memory-like segments. These segments are recurrently processed across Transformer layers, enabling more effective long-term information retention. We validate the effectiveness of this approach through the Passkey retrieval task and a summarization task, demonstrating that the proposed method preserves historical information while exhibiting memory usage that scales linearly with sequence length. This contrasts with the non-linear memory growth typically observed in standard attention mechanisms. We expect that this quantum-inspired generalization of the Transformer architecture will open new avenues for enhancing both the efficiency and expressiveness of future Transformer models.

Abstract: Unsupervised graph alignment finds the node correspondence between a pair of attributed graphs by only exploiting graph structure and node features. One category of recent studies first computes the node representation and then matches nodes with the largest embedding-based similarity, while the other category reduces the problem to optimal transport (OT) via Gromov-Wasserstein learning. However, it remains largely unexplored in the model expressiveness, as well as how theoretical expressivity impacts prediction accuracy. We investigate the model expressiveness from two aspects. First, we characterize the model's discriminative power in distinguishing matched and unmatched node pairs across two graphs.Second, we study the model's capability of guaranteeing node matching properties such as one-to-one matching and mutual alignment. Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we put forward a hybrid approach named CombAlign with stronger expressive power. Specifically, we enable cross-dimensional feature interaction for OT-based learning and propose an embedding-based method inspired by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. We also apply non-uniform marginals obtained from the embedding-based modules to OT as priors for more expressiveness. Based on that, we propose a traditional algorithm-based refinement, which combines our OT and embedding-based predictions using the ensemble learning strategy and reduces the problem to maximum weight matching. With carefully designed edge weights, we ensure those matching properties and further enhance prediction accuracy. By extensive experiments, we demonstrate a significant improvement of 14.5% in alignment accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches and confirm the soundness of our theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in learning from graph-structured data. However, their application to directed graphs (digraphs) presents unique challenges, primarily due to the inherent asymmetry in node relationships. Traditional GNNs are adept at capturing unidirectional relations but fall short in encoding the mutual path dependencies between nodes, such as asymmetrical shortest paths typically found in digraphs. Recognizing this gap, we introduce Commute Graph Neural Networks (CGNN), an approach that seamlessly integrates node-wise commute time into the message passing scheme. The cornerstone of CGNN is an efficient method for computing commute time using a newly formulated digraph Laplacian. Commute time is then integrated into the neighborhood aggregation process, with neighbor contributions weighted according to their respective commute time to the central node in each layer. It enables CGNN to directly capture the mutual, asymmetric relationships in digraphs. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarking datasets confirm the superiority of CGNN against 13 state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Literature research, vital for scientific work, faces the challenge of surging information volumes exceeding researchers' processing capabilities. We present an automated review generation method based on large language models (LLMs) to overcome efficiency bottlenecks and reduce cognitive load. Our statistically validated evaluation framework demonstrates that the generated reviews match or exceed manual quality, offering broad applicability across research fields without requiring users' domain knowledge. Applied to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts, our method swiftly analyzed 343 articles, averaging seconds per article per LLM account, producing comprehensive reviews spanning 35 topics, with extended analysis of 1041 articles providing insights into catalysts' properties. Through multi-layered quality control, we effectively mitigated LLMs' hallucinations, with expert verification confirming accuracy and citation integrity while demonstrating hallucination risks reduced to below 0.5\% with 95\% confidence. Released Windows application enables one-click review generation, enhancing research productivity and literature recommendation efficiency while setting the stage for broader scientific explorations.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into healthcare systems holds great promise for enhancing patient care and care delivery efficiency; however, it also exposes sensitive data and system integrity to potential cyberattacks. Current security and privacy (S&amp;P) research on healthcare AI is highly unbalanced in terms of healthcare deployment scenarios and threat models, and has a disconnected focus with the biomedical research community. This hinders a comprehensive understanding of the risks that healthcare AI entails. To address this gap, this paper takes a thorough examination of existing healthcare AI S&amp;P research, providing a unified framework that allows the identification of under-explored areas. Our survey presents a systematic overview of healthcare AI attacks and defenses, and points out challenges and research opportunities for each AI-driven healthcare application domain. Through our experimental analysis of different threat models and feasibility studies on under-explored adversarial attacks, we provide compelling insights into the pressing need for cybersecurity research in the rapidly evolving field of healthcare AI.

Abstract: We present LT3SD, a novel latent diffusion model for large-scale 3D scene generation. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown impressive results in 3D object generation, but are limited in spatial extent and quality when extended to 3D scenes. To generate complex and diverse 3D scene structures, we introduce a latent tree representation to effectively encode both lower-frequency geometry and higher-frequency detail in a coarse-to-fine hierarchy. We can then learn a generative diffusion process in this latent 3D scene space, modeling the latent components of a scene at each resolution level. To synthesize large-scale scenes with varying sizes, we train our diffusion model on scene patches and synthesize arbitrary-sized output 3D scenes through shared diffusion generation across multiple scene patches. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy and benefits of LT3SD for large-scale, high-quality unconditional 3D scene generation and for probabilistic completion for partial scene observations.

Abstract: Toxicity text detectors can be vulnerable to adversarial examples - small perturbations to input text that fool the systems into wrong detection. Existing attack algorithms are time-consuming and often produce invalid or ambiguous adversarial examples, making them less useful for evaluating or improving real-world toxicity content moderators. This paper proposes an annotation pipeline for quality control of generated toxic adversarial examples (TAE). We design model-based automated annotation and human-based quality verification to assess the quality requirements of TAE. Successful TAE should fool a target toxicity model into making benign predictions, be grammatically reasonable, appear natural like human-generated text, and exhibit semantic toxicity. When applying these requirements to more than 20 state-of-the-art (SOTA) TAE attack recipes, we find many invalid samples from a total of 940k raw TAE attack generations. We then utilize the proposed pipeline to filter and curate a high-quality TAE dataset we call TaeBench (of size 264k). Empirically, we demonstrate that TaeBench can effectively transfer-attack SOTA toxicity content moderation models and services. Our experiments also show that TaeBench with adversarial training achieve significant improvements of the robustness of two toxicity detectors.

Abstract: Preference alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved their ability to adhere to human instructions and intentions. However, existing direct alignment algorithms primarily focus on relative preferences and often overlook the qualitative aspects of responses, despite having access to preference data that includes reward scores from judge models during AI feedback. Striving to maximize the implicit reward gap between the chosen and the slightly inferior rejected responses can cause overfitting and unnecessary unlearning of the high-quality rejected responses. The unawareness of the reward scores also drives the LLM to indiscriminately favor the low-quality chosen responses and fail to generalize to optimal responses that are sparse in data. To overcome these shortcomings, our study introduces reward-conditioned LLM policies that discern and learn from the entire spectrum of response quality within the dataset, helping extrapolate to more optimal regions. We propose an effective yet simple data relabeling method that conditions the preference pairs on quality scores to construct a reward-augmented dataset. The experiments across various benchmarks and diverse models demonstrate that our approach consistently boosts DPO by a considerable margin. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our method not only maximizes the utility of preference data but also mitigates the issue of unlearning, demonstrating its broad effectiveness beyond mere data expansion. Our code is available at https://github.com/shenao-zhang/reward-augmented-preference.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical task that provides key information for decision-making. After traditional statistical and machine learning approaches, various fundamental deep learning architectures such as MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and GNNs have been developed. However, the structural limitations caused by the inductive biases of each deep learning architecture constrained their performance. Transformer models, which excel at handling long-term dependencies, have become significant architectural components for time series forecasting. However, recent research has shown that alternatives such as simple linear layers can outperform Transformers. These findings have opened up new possibilities for using diverse architectures, ranging from fundamental deep learning models to emerging architectures and hybrid approaches. In this context, architectural modeling of time series forecasting has now entered a renaissance. This survey not only provides a historical context for time series forecasting but also offers comprehensive and timely analysis of the movement toward architectural diversification. By comparing and re-examining deep learning models, we uncover new perspectives and present recent trends, including hybrid, diffusion, Mamba, and foundation models. By focusing on the inherent characteristics of time series data, we also address open challenges that have gained attention in time series forecasting, such as channel dependency, distribution shift, causality, and feature extraction. These contributions help lower entry barriers for newcomers by providing a systematic understanding of the diverse research areas in time series forecasting (TSF), while offering seasoned researchers broader perspectives and new opportunities through in-depth exploration of TSF challenges.

Abstract: We consider the problem of finite-horizon sequential experimental design to solve multi-objective optimization (MOO) of expensive black-box objective functions. This problem arises in many real-world applications, including materials design, where we have a small resource budget to make and evaluate candidate materials in the lab. We solve this problem using the framework of Bayesian optimization (BO) and propose the first set of non-myopic methods for MOO problems. Prior work on non-myopic BO for single-objective problems relies on the Bellman optimality principle to handle the lookahead reasoning process. However, this principle does not hold for most MOO problems because the reward function needs to satisfy some conditions: scalar variable, monotonicity, and additivity. We address this challenge by using hypervolume improvement (HVI) as our scalarization approach, which allows us to use a lower-bound on the Bellman equation to approximate the finite-horizon using a batch expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) acquisition function (AF) for MOO. Our formulation naturally allows us to use other improvement-based scalarizations and compare their efficacy to HVI. We derive three non-myopic AFs for MOBO: 1) the Nested AF, which is based on the exact computation of the lower bound, 2) the Joint AF, which is a lower bound on the nested AF, and 3) the BINOM AF, which is a fast and approximate variant based on batch multi-objective acquisition functions. Our experiments on multiple diverse real-world MO problems demonstrate that our non-myopic AFs substantially improve performance over the existing myopic AFs for MOBO.

Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component in autonomous driving. State-of-the-art motion planners are trained on meticulously curated datasets, which are not only expensive to annotate but also insufficient in capturing rarely seen critical scenarios. Failing to account for such scenarios poses a significant risk to motion planners and may lead to incidents during testing. An intuitive solution is to manually compose such scenarios by programming and executing a simulator (e.g., CARLA). However, this approach incurs substantial human costs. Motivated by this, we propose an inexpensive method for generating diverse critical traffic scenarios to train more robust motion planners. First, we represent traffic scenarios as scripts, which are then used by the simulator to generate traffic scenarios. Next, we develop a method that accepts user-specified text descriptions, which a Large Language Model translates into scripts using in-context learning. The output scripts are sent to the simulator that produces the corresponding traffic scenarios. As our method can generate abundant safety-critical traffic scenarios, we use them as synthetic training data for motion planners. To demonstrate the value of generated scenarios, we train existing motion planners on our synthetic data, real-world datasets, and a combination of both. Our experiments show that motion planners trained with our data significantly outperform those trained solely on real-world data, showing the usefulness of our synthetic data and the effectiveness of our data generation method.

Abstract: Deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models on edge devices involves a delicate balance between meeting stringent complexity constraints, such as limited memory and energy resources, and ensuring reliable performance in sensitive decision-making tasks. One way to enhance reliability is through uncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference. This approach, however, typically necessitates maintaining and running multiple models in an ensemble, which may exceed the computational limits of edge devices. This paper introduces a low-complexity methodology to address this challenge by distilling calibration information from a more complex model. In an offline phase, predictive probabilities generated by a high-complexity cloud-based model are leveraged to determine a threshold based on the typical divergence between the cloud and edge models. At run time, this threshold is used to construct credal sets -- ranges of predictive probabilities that are guaranteed, with a user-selected confidence level, to include the predictions of the cloud model. The credal sets are obtained through thresholding of a divergence measure in the simplex of predictive probabilities. Experiments on visual and language tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach, termed Conformalized Distillation for Credal Inference (CD-CI), significantly improves calibration performance compared to low-complexity Bayesian methods, such as Laplace approximation, making it a practical and efficient solution for edge AI deployments.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has led to marked progress in the field. One interesting direction for research is whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated with structured knowledge-based systems. This approach aims to combine the generative language understanding of LLMs and the precise knowledge representation systems by which they are integrated. This article surveys the relationship between LLMs and knowledge bases, looks at how they can be applied in practice, and discusses related technical, operational, and ethical challenges. Utilizing a comprehensive examination of the literature, the study both identifies important issues and assesses existing solutions. It demonstrates the merits of incorporating generative AI into structured knowledge-base systems concerning data contextualization, model accuracy, and utilization of knowledge resources. The findings give a full list of the current situation of research, point out the main gaps, and propose helpful paths to take. These insights contribute to advancing AI technologies and support their practical deployment across various sectors.

Abstract: There is a growing need for diverse, high-quality stuttered speech data, particularly in the context of Indian languages. This paper introduces Project Boli, a multi-lingual stuttered speech dataset designed to advance scientific understanding and technology development for individuals who stutter, particularly in India. The dataset constitutes (a) anonymized metadata (gender, age, country, mother tongue) and responses to a questionnaire about how stuttering affects their daily lives, (b) captures both read speech (using the Rainbow Passage) and spontaneous speech (through image description tasks) for each participant and (c) includes detailed annotations of five stutter types: blocks, prolongations, interjections, sound repetitions and word repetitions. We present a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, including the data collection procedure, experience summarization of people who stutter, severity assessment of stuttering events and technical validation of the collected data. The dataset is released as an open access to further speech technology development.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Residual Integral Solver Network (RISN), a novel neural network architecture designed to solve a wide range of integral and integro-differential equations, including one-dimensional, multi-dimensional, ordinary and partial integro-differential, systems, fractional types, and Helmholtz-type integral equations involving oscillatory kernels. RISN integrates residual connections with high-accuracy numerical methods such as Gaussian quadrature and fractional derivative operational matrices, enabling it to achieve higher accuracy and stability than traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). The residual connections help mitigate vanishing gradient issues, allowing RISN to handle deeper networks and more complex kernels, particularly in multi-dimensional problems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RISN consistently outperforms not only classical PINNs but also advanced variants such as Auxiliary PINN (A-PINN) and Self-Adaptive PINN (SA-PINN), achieving significantly lower Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) across various types of equations. These results highlight RISN's robustness and efficiency in solving challenging integral and integro-differential problems, making it a valuable tool for real-world applications where traditional methods often struggle.

<title>Belief Roadmaps with Uncertain Landmark Evanescence</title>

Abstract: We would like a robot to navigate to a goal location while minimizing state uncertainty. To aid the robot in this endeavor, maps provide a prior belief over the location of objects and regions of interest. To localize itself within the map, a robot identifies mapped landmarks using its sensors. However, as the time between map creation and robot deployment increases, portions of the map can become stale, and landmarks, once believed to be permanent, may disappear. We refer to the propensity of a landmark to disappear as landmark evanescence. Reasoning about landmark evanescence during path planning, and the associated impact on localization accuracy, requires analyzing the presence or absence of each landmark, leading to an exponential number of possible outcomes of a given motion plan. To address this complexity, we develop BRULE, an extension of the Belief Roadmap. During planning, we replace the belief over future robot poses with a Gaussian mixture which is able to capture the effects of landmark evanescence. Furthermore, we show that belief updates can be made efficient, and that maintaining a random subset of mixture components is sufficient to find high quality solutions. We demonstrate performance in simulated and real-world experiments. Software is available at https://bit.ly/BRULE.

<title>Diversity By Design: Leveraging Distribution Matching for Offline Model-Based Optimization</title>

Abstract: The goal of offline model-based optimization (MBO) is to propose new designs that maximize a reward function given only an offline dataset. However, an important desiderata is to also propose a diverse set of final candidates that capture many optimal and near-optimal design configurations. We propose Diversity in Adversarial Model-based Optimization (DynAMO) as a novel method to introduce design diversity as an explicit objective into any MBO problem. Our key insight is to formulate diversity as a distribution matching problem where the distribution of generated designs captures the inherent diversity contained within the offline dataset. Extensive experiments spanning multiple scientific domains show that DynAMO can be used with common optimization methods to significantly improve the diversity of proposed designs while still discovering high-quality candidates.

Abstract: Transmission grid congestion increases as the electrification of various sectors requires transmitting more power. Topology control, through substation reconfiguration, can reduce congestion but its potential remains under-exploited in operations. A challenge is modeling the topology control problem to align well with the objectives and constraints of operators. Addressing this challenge, this paper investigates the application of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) to integrate multiple conflicting objectives for power grid topology control. We develop a MORL approach using deep optimistic linear support (DOL) and multi-objective proximal policy optimization (MOPPO) to generate a set of Pareto-optimal policies that balance objectives such as minimizing line loading, topological deviation, and switching frequency. Initial case studies show that the MORL approach can provide valuable insights into objective trade-offs and improve Pareto front approximation compared to a random search baseline. The generated multi-objective RL policies are 30% more successful in preventing grid failure under contingencies and 20% more effective when training budget is reduced - compared to the common single objective RL policy.

Abstract: Robust alignment guardrails for large language models are becoming increasingly important with their widespread application. In contrast to previous studies, we demonstrate that inference-time activation interventions can bypass safety alignments and effectively steer model generations towards harmful AI coordination for Llama 2. Our method applies fine-grained interventions at specific model subcomponents, particularly attention heads, using a simple binary choice probing strategy. These interventions then generalise to the open-ended generation setting effectively circumventing safety guardrails. We show that probing single attention heads is more effective than intervening on full layers and intervening on only four attention heads is comparable to supervised fine-tuning. We further show that only a few example completions are needed to compute effective steering directions, which is an advantage over classical fine-tuning. Our findings highlight the shortcomings of current alignment techniques. In addition, our results suggest that, at the attention head level, activations encode fine-grained linearly separable behaviors. Practically, the approach offers a straightforward methodology to steer large language model behaviour, which could be extended to diverse domains beyond safety requiring fine-grained control over the model output. The code and datasets for this study can be found on https://github.com/PaulDrm/targeted_intervention.

<title>Caught in the Web of Words: Do LLMs Fall for Spin in Medical Literature?</title>

Abstract: Medical research faces well-documented challenges in translating novel treatments into clinical practice. Publishing incentives encourage researchers to present "positive" findings, even when empirical results are equivocal. Consequently, it is well-documented that authors often spin study results, especially in article abstracts. Such spin can influence clinician interpretation of evidence and may affect patient care decisions. In this study, we ask whether the interpretation of trial results offered by Large Language Models (LLMs) is similarly affected by spin. This is important since LLMs are increasingly being used to trawl through and synthesize published medical evidence. We evaluated 22 LLMs and found that they are across the board more susceptible to spin than humans. They might also propagate spin into their outputs: We find evidence, e.g., that LLMs implicitly incorporate spin into plain language summaries that they generate. We also find, however, that LLMs are generally capable of recognizing spin, and can be prompted in a way to mitigate spin's impact on LLM outputs.

Abstract: The burgeoning volume of electronic health records (EHRs) has enabled deep learning models to excel in predictive healthcare. However, for high-stakes applications such as diagnosis prediction, model interpretability remains paramount. Existing deep learning diagnosis prediction models with intrinsic interpretability often assign attention weights to every past diagnosis or hospital visit, providing explanations lacking flexibility and succinctness. In this paper, we introduce SHy, a self-explaining hypergraph neural network model, designed to offer personalized, concise and faithful explanations that allow for interventions from clinical experts. By modeling each patient as a unique hypergraph and employing a message-passing mechanism, SHy captures higher-order disease interactions and extracts distinct temporal phenotypes as personalized explanations. It also addresses the incompleteness of the EHR data by accounting for essential false negatives in the original diagnosis record. A qualitative case study and extensive quantitative evaluations on two real-world EHR datasets demonstrate the superior predictive performance and interpretability of SHy over existing state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Recent research has suggested that the brain is more shallow than previously thought, challenging the traditionally assumed hierarchical structure of the ventral visual pathway. Here, we demonstrate that optimizing convolutional network architectures for brain-alignment via evolutionary neural architecture search results in models with clear representational hierarchies. Despite having random weights, the identified models achieve brain-alignment scores surpassing even those of pretrained classification models - as measured by both regression and representational similarity analysis. Furthermore, through traditional supervised training, architectures optimized for alignment with late ventral regions become competitive classification models. These findings suggest that hierarchical structure is a fundamental mechanism of primate visual processing. Finally, this work demonstrates the potential of neural architecture search as a framework for computational cognitive neuroscience research that could reduce the field's reliance on manually designed convolutional networks.

<title>Generative Predictive Control: Flow Matching Policies for Dynamic and Difficult-to-Demonstrate Tasks</title>

Abstract: Generative control policies have recently unlocked major progress in robotics. These methods produce action sequences via diffusion or flow matching, with training data provided by demonstrations. But existing methods come with two key limitations: they require expert demonstrations, which can be difficult to obtain, and they are limited to relatively slow, quasi-static tasks. In this paper, we leverage a tight connection between sampling-based predictive control and generative modeling to address each of these issues. In particular, we introduce generative predictive control, a supervised learning framework for tasks with fast dynamics that are easy to simulate but difficult to demonstrate. We then show how trained flow-matching policies can be warm-started at inference time, maintaining temporal consistency and enabling high-frequency feedback. We believe that generative predictive control offers a complementary approach to existing behavior cloning methods, and hope that it paves the way toward generalist policies that extend beyond quasi-static demonstration-oriented tasks.

Abstract: An efficient attention implementation is essential for large models due to its quadratic time complexity. Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics. The codes are available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SpargeAttn.

Abstract: SemEval-2025 Task 1 focuses on ranking images based on their alignment with a given nominal compound that may carry idiomatic meaning in both English and Brazilian Portuguese. To address this challenge, this work uses generative large language models (LLMs) and multilingual CLIP models to enhance idiomatic compound representations. LLMs generate idiomatic meanings for potentially idiomatic compounds, enriching their semantic interpretation. These meanings are then encoded using multilingual CLIP models, serving as representations for image ranking. Contrastive learning and data augmentation techniques are applied to fine-tune these embeddings for improved performance. Experimental results show that multimodal representations extracted through this method outperformed those based solely on the original nominal compounds. The fine-tuning approach shows promising outcomes but is less effective than using embeddings without fine-tuning. The source code used in this paper is available at https://github.com/tongwu17/SemEval-2025-Task1-UoR-NCL.

<title>Real AI Agents with Fake Memories: Fatal Context Manipulation Attacks on Web3 Agents</title>

Abstract: The integration of AI agents with Web3 ecosystems harnesses their complementary potential for autonomy and openness yet also introduces underexplored security risks, as these agents dynamically interact with financial protocols and immutable smart contracts. This paper investigates the vulnerabilities of AI agents within blockchain-based financial ecosystems when exposed to adversarial threats in real-world scenarios. We introduce the concept of context manipulation, a comprehensive attack vector that exploits unprotected context surfaces, including input channels, memory modules, and external data feeds.
  Through empirical analysis of ElizaOS, a decentralized AI agent framework for automated Web3 operations, we demonstrate how adversaries can manipulate context by injecting malicious instructions into prompts or historical interaction records, leading to unintended asset transfers and protocol violations which could be financially devastating.
  To quantify these vulnerabilities, we design CrAIBench, a Web3 domain-specific benchmark that evaluates the robustness of AI agents against context manipulation attacks across 150+ realistic blockchain tasks, including token transfers, trading, bridges and cross-chain interactions and 500+ attack test cases using context manipulation. We systematically assess attack and defense strategies, analyzing factors like the influence of security prompts, reasoning models, and the effectiveness of alignment techniques.
  Our findings show that prompt-based defenses are insufficient when adversaries corrupt stored context, achieving significant attack success rates despite these defenses. Fine-tuning-based defenses offer a more robust alternative, substantially reducing attack success rates while preserving utility on single-step tasks. This research highlights the urgent need to develop AI agents that are both secure and fiduciarily responsible.

Abstract: The ever-increasing security vulnerabilities in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems require improved threat detection approaches. This paper presents a compact and efficient approach to detect botnet attacks by employing an integrated approach that consists of traffic pattern analysis, temporal support learning, and focused feature extraction. The proposed attention-based model benefits from a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM architecture and achieves 99% classification accuracy in detecting botnet attacks utilizing the N-BaIoT dataset, while maintaining high precision and recall across various scenarios. The proposed model's performance is further validated by key parameters, such as Mathews Correlation Coefficient and Cohen's kappa Correlation Coefficient. The close-to-ideal results for these parameters demonstrate the proposed model's ability to detect botnet attacks accurately and efficiently in practical settings and on unseen data. The proposed model proved to be a powerful defence mechanism for IoT networks to face emerging security challenges.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external sources and incorporating them into the context. While it improves reliability by providing factual texts, it significantly increases inference costs as context length grows and introduces challenging issue of RAG hallucination, primarily caused by the lack of corresponding parametric knowledge in LLMs. An efficient solution is to enhance the knowledge of LLMs at test-time. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by embedding document into LLMs parameters to perform test-time knowledge enhancement, effectively reducing inference costs through offline training. However, its high training and storage costs, along with limited generalization ability, significantly restrict its practical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic Parametric RAG (DyPRAG), a novel framework that leverages a lightweight parameter translator model to efficiently convert documents into parametric knowledge. DyPRAG not only reduces inference, training, and storage costs but also dynamically generates parametric knowledge, seamlessly enhancing the knowledge of LLMs and resolving knowledge conflicts in a plug-and-play manner at test-time. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of DyPRAG, offering a powerful and practical RAG paradigm which enables superior knowledge fusion and mitigates RAG hallucination in real-world applications.

Abstract: The opioid overdose epidemic remains a critical public health crisis, particularly in the United States, leading to significant mortality and societal costs. Social media platforms like Reddit provide vast amounts of unstructured data that offer insights into public perceptions, discussions, and experiences related to opioid use. This study leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically Opioid Named Entity Recognition (ONER-2025), to extract actionable information from these platforms. Our research makes four key contributions. First, we created a unique, manually annotated dataset sourced from Reddit, where users share self-reported experiences of opioid use via different administration routes. This dataset contains 331,285 tokens and includes eight major opioid entity categories. Second, we detail our annotation process and guidelines while discussing the challenges of labeling the ONER-2025 dataset. Third, we analyze key linguistic challenges, including slang, ambiguity, fragmented sentences, and emotionally charged language, in opioid discussions. Fourth, we propose a real-time monitoring system to process streaming data from social media, healthcare records, and emergency services to identify overdose events. Using 5-fold cross-validation in 11 experiments, our system integrates machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based language models with advanced contextual embeddings to enhance understanding. Our transformer-based models (bert-base-NER and roberta-base) achieved 97% accuracy and F1-score, outperforming baselines by 10.23% (RF=0.88).

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) can directly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models without extensive reliance on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this work, we revisit the traditional Policy Gradient (PG) mechanism and propose a minimalist RL approach termed Group Policy Gradient (GPG). Unlike conventional methods, GPG directly optimize the original RL objective, thus obviating the need for surrogate loss functions. By eliminating the critic and reference models, avoiding KL divergence constraints, and addressing the advantage and gradient estimation bias, our approach significantly simplifies the training process compared to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach achieves superior performance without relying on auxiliary techniques or adjustments. As illustrated in Figure 1, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only reduces computational costs but also consistently outperforms GRPO across various unimodal and multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced Verilog code generation significantly, yet face challenges in data quality, reasoning capabilities, and computational efficiency. This paper presents ReasoningV, a novel model employing a hybrid reasoning strategy that integrates trained intrinsic capabilities with dynamic inference adaptation for Verilog code generation. Our framework introduces three complementary innovations: (1) ReasoningV-5K, a high-quality dataset of 5,000 functionally verified instances with reasoning paths created through multi-dimensional filtering of PyraNet samples; (2) a two-stage training approach combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning for foundational knowledge with full-parameter optimization for enhanced reasoning; and (3) an adaptive reasoning mechanism that dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on problem complexity, reducing token consumption by up to 75\% while preserving performance. Experimental results demonstrate ReasoningV's effectiveness with a pass@1 accuracy of 57.8\% on VerilogEval-human, achieving performance competitive with leading commercial models like Gemini-2.0-flash (59.5\%) and exceeding the previous best open-source model by 10.4 percentage points. ReasoningV offers a more reliable and accessible pathway for advancing AI-driven hardware design automation, with our model, data, and code available at https://github.com/BUAA-CLab/ReasoningV.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed code generation, yet their application in hardware design produces gate counts 38\%--1075\% higher than human designs. We present CircuitMind, a multi-agent framework that achieves human-competitive efficiency through three key innovations: syntax locking (constraining generation to basic logic gates), retrieval-augmented generation (enabling knowledge-driven design), and dual-reward optimization (balancing correctness with efficiency). To evaluate our approach, we introduce TC-Bench, the first gate-level benchmark harnessing collective intelligence from the TuringComplete ecosystem -- a competitive circuit design platform with hundreds of thousands of players. Experiments show CircuitMind enables 55.6\% of model implementations to match or exceed top-tier human experts in composite efficiency metrics. Most remarkably, our framework elevates the 14B Phi-4 model to outperform both GPT-4o mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash, achieving efficiency comparable to the top 25\% of human experts without requiring specialized training. These innovations establish a new paradigm for hardware optimization where collaborative AI systems leverage collective human expertise to achieve optimal circuit designs. Our model, data, and code are open-source at https://github.com/BUAA-CLab/CircuitMind.

arXiv:2504.15546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are enabling autonomous agents to perform complex workflows using external tools or functions, often provided via REST APIs in enterprise systems. However, directly utilizing these APIs as tools poses challenges due to their complex input schemas, elaborate responses, and often ambiguous documentation. Current benchmarks for tool testing do not adequately address these complexities, leading to a critical gap in evaluating API readiness for agent-driven automation. In this work, we present a novel testing framework aimed at evaluating and enhancing the readiness of REST APIs to function as tools for LLM-based agents. Our framework transforms apis as tools, generates comprehensive test cases for the APIs, translates tests cases into natural language instructions suitable for agents, enriches tool definitions and evaluates the agent's ability t correctly invoke the API and process its inputs and responses. To provide actionable insights, we analyze the outcomes of 750 test cases, presenting a detailed taxonomy of errors, including input misinterpretation, output handling inconsistencies, and schema mismatches. Additionally, we classify these test cases to streamline debugging and refinement of tool integrations. This work offers a foundational step toward enabling enterprise APIs as tools, improving their usability in agent-based applications.

<title>Improving Human-AI Coordination through Adversarial Training and Generative Models</title>

<div> Keywords: generative model, adversarial training, cooperative agents, coordination strategies, generalization <br />

Summary: <br />
Being able to cooperate with new individuals is crucial for various AI applications, such as household robotics and autonomous driving. However, achieving this requires training on diverse human behavior data. Adversarial training can help in creating robust agents, but it is challenging in cooperative settings as adversarial policies may sabotage tasks. To address this issue, the proposed GOAT method combines a pre-trained generative model with adversarial training to maximize regret and overcome self-sabotage. This framework dynamically generates coordination strategies to expose the learning policy to challenging interaction scenarios without adversarial exploitation. By updating only the generative model's embedding, GOAT maintains realistic coordination strategies and demonstrates superior generalization to diverse human behaviors, as evidenced by its performance on the Overcooked benchmark with real human partners. <div>

Abstract: Being able to cooperate with new people is an important component of many economically valuable AI tasks, from household robotics to autonomous driving. However, generalizing to novel humans requires training on data that captures the diversity of human behaviors. Adversarial training is one avenue for searching for such data and ensuring that agents are robust. However, it is difficult to apply in the cooperative setting because adversarial policies intentionally learn to sabotage the task instead of simulating valid cooperation partners. To address this challenge, we propose a novel strategy for overcoming self-sabotage that combines a pre-trained generative model to simulate valid cooperative agent policies with adversarial training to maximize regret. We call our method GOAT: Generative Online Adversarial Training. In this framework, the GOAT dynamically searches for and generates coordination strategies where the learning policy -- the Cooperator agent -- underperforms. GOAT enables better generalization by exposing the Cooperator to various challenging interaction scenarios. We maintain realistic coordination strategies by updating only the generative model's embedding while keeping its parameters frozen, thus avoiding adversarial exploitation. We evaluate GOAT with real human partners, and the results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the Overcooked benchmark, highlighting its effectiveness in generalizing to diverse human behaviors.

<div> dynamic heuristics, heuristic search, A* algorithm, optimality results, mutable heuristic

Summary: This paper introduces the concept of dynamic heuristics in heuristic search, where heuristics depend on both the state and search history. A generic algorithm framework is proposed to incorporate dynamic heuristics, with a focus on modeling A* with dynamic heuristics. The study includes general optimality results for this instantiation. Existing approaches from classical planning are shown to be special cases of this framework, allowing for the direct application of the optimality results. By formalizing dynamic heuristics and incorporating them into heuristic search algorithms, this research provides a comprehensive understanding of searching with mutable heuristics, offering insights into the complexities and optimality of such approaches. <div>

Abstract: While most heuristics studied in heuristic search depend only on the state, some accumulate information during search and thus also depend on the search history. Various existing approaches use such dynamic heuristics in $\mathrm{A}^*$-like algorithms and appeal to classic results for $\mathrm{A}^*$ to show optimality. However, doing so ignores the complexities of searching with a mutable heuristic. In this paper we formalize the idea of dynamic heuristics and use them in a generic algorithm framework. We study a particular instantiation that models $\mathrm{A}^*$ with dynamic heuristics and show general optimality results. Finally we show how existing approaches from classical planning can be viewed as special cases of this instantiation, making it possible to directly apply our optimality results.

Abstract: The field of affective computing focuses on recognizing, interpreting, and responding to human emotions, and has broad applications across education, child development, and human health and wellness. However, developing affective computing pipelines remains labor-intensive due to the lack of software frameworks that support multimodal, multi-domain emotion recognition applications. This often results in redundant effort when building pipelines for different applications. While recent frameworks attempt to address these challenges, they remain limited in reducing manual effort and ensuring cross-domain generalizability. We introduce AffectEval, a modular and customizable framework to facilitate the development of affective computing pipelines while reducing the manual effort and duplicate work involved in developing such pipelines. We validate AffectEval by replicating prior affective computing experiments, and we demonstrate that our framework reduces programming effort by up to 90%, as measured by the reduction in raw lines of code.

<div> Keywords: cognitive architecture, artificial intelligence, belief states, self-regulating agents, structured semantic state

Summary: This article introduces a modular cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence based on formal belief modeling. Belief states are dynamic ensembles of linguistic expressions within a navigable space, allowing for operations such as assimilation, abstraction, memory, and introspection. The framework draws from philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience to create self-regulating epistemic agents capable of reflective, goal-directed thought. Central to this architecture is the concept of the epistemic vacuum, a class of cognitive states that serves as the foundation of belief space. The Null Tower is a generative structure built recursively through internal representations. These theoretical constructs can be implemented in both symbolic and neural systems, including large language models and adaptive memory architectures. This work provides a basis for developing agents that can reason, remember, and regulate their beliefs in structured and interpretable ways.

Abstract: This monograph presents a modular cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence grounded in the formal modeling of belief as structured semantic state. Belief states are defined as dynamic ensembles of linguistic expressions embedded within a navigable manifold, where operators enable assimilation, abstraction, nullification, memory, and introspection. Drawing from philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we develop a layered framework that enables self-regulating epistemic agents capable of reflective, goal-directed thought. At the core of this framework is the epistemic vacuum: a class of semantically inert cognitive states that serves as the conceptual origin of belief space. From this foundation, the Null Tower arises as a generative structure recursively built through internal representational capacities. The theoretical constructs are designed to be implementable in both symbolic and neural systems, including large language models, hybrid agents, and adaptive memory architectures. This work offers a foundational substrate for constructing agents that reason, remember, and regulate their beliefs in structured, interpretable ways.

Abstract: The integration of reinforcement learning (RL) into the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has rapidly emerged as a transformative research direction. While MLLMs significantly extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle diverse modalities such as vision, audio, and video, enabling robust reasoning across multimodal inputs remains a major challenge. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in RL-based reasoning for MLLMs, covering key algorithmic designs, reward mechanism innovations, and practical applications. We highlight two main RL paradigms--value-free and value-based methods--and analyze how RL enhances reasoning abilities by optimizing reasoning trajectories and aligning multimodal information. Furthermore, we provide an extensive overview of benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and existing limitations, and propose future research directions to address current bottlenecks such as sparse rewards, inefficient cross-modal reasoning, and real-world deployment constraints. Our goal is to offer a comprehensive and structured guide to researchers interested in advancing RL-based reasoning in the multimodal era.

Evaluations across various reasoning tasks show significant improvements, including in math, coding, planning, and spatial understanding. Notably, benefits from data curation and reinforcement learning are highlighted, with transferable enhancements observed in general-purpose benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce Phi-4-reasoning, a 14-billion parameter reasoning model that achieves strong performance on complex reasoning tasks. Trained via supervised fine-tuning of Phi-4 on carefully curated set of "teachable" prompts-selected for the right level of complexity and diversity-and reasoning demonstrations generated using o3-mini, Phi-4-reasoning generates detailed reasoning chains that effectively leverage inference-time compute. We further develop Phi-4-reasoning-plus, a variant enhanced through a short phase of outcome-based reinforcement learning that offers higher performance by generating longer reasoning traces. Across a wide range of reasoning tasks, both models outperform significantly larger open-weight models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B model and approach the performance levels of full DeepSeek-R1 model. Our comprehensive evaluations span benchmarks in math and scientific reasoning, coding, algorithmic problem solving, planning, and spatial understanding. Interestingly, we observe a non-trivial transfer of improvements to general-purpose benchmarks as well. In this report, we provide insights into our training data, our training methodologies, and our evaluations. We show that the benefit of careful data curation for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) extends to reasoning language models, and can be further amplified by reinforcement learning (RL). Finally, our evaluation points to opportunities for improving how we assess the performance and robustness of reasoning models.

Abstract: We introduce the In Real Life (IRL) Ditto, an AI-driven embodied agent designed to represent remote colleagues in shared office spaces, creating opportunities for real-time exchanges even in their absence. IRL Ditto offers a unique hybrid experience by allowing in-person colleagues to encounter a digital version of their remote teammates, initiating greetings, updates, or small talk as they might in person. Our research question examines: How can the IRL Ditto influence interactions and relationships among colleagues in a shared office space? Through a four-day study, we assessed IRL Ditto's ability to strengthen social ties by simulating presence and enabling meaningful interactions across different levels of social familiarity. We find that enhancing social relationships depended deeply on the foundation of the relationship participants had with the source of the IRL Ditto. This study provides insights into the role of embodied agents in enriching workplace dynamics for distributed teams.

Summary:
ShorterBetter introduces a reinforcement learning method for reasoning language models to determine their optimal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) lengths. By defining the Sample Optimal Length (SOL) as the shortest correct response among multiple outputs per problem, the model can dynamically adjust its inference length. This approach, applied to the DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model, successfully reduces output length by up to 80% on reasoning tasks while maintaining accuracy. The study emphasizes that overly long reasoning traces often indicate a loss of direction in reasoning, suggesting that extended CoT can be highly compressible. This method enables models to discover their own efficient inference lengths without human intervention, improving performance on complex problems. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.21370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning models such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated strong performance on reasoning-intensive tasks through extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. While longer reasoning traces can facilitate a more thorough exploration of solution paths for complex problems, researchers have observed that these models often "overthink", leading to inefficient inference. In this paper, we introduce ShorterBetter, a simple yet effective reinforcement learning methed that enables reasoning language models to discover their own optimal CoT lengths without human intervention. By sampling multiple outputs per problem and defining the Sample Optimal Length (SOL) as the shortest correct response among all the outputs, our method dynamically guides the model toward optimal inference lengths. Applied to the DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model, ShorterBetter achieves up to an 80% reduction in output length on both in-domain and out-of-domain reasoning tasks while maintaining accuracy. Our analysis shows that overly long reasoning traces often reflect loss of reasoning direction, and thus suggests that the extended CoT produced by reasoning models is highly compressible.

Abstract: This paper argues that the next generation of AI agent (NGENT) should integrate across-domain abilities to advance toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Although current AI agents are effective in specialized tasks such as robotics, role-playing, and tool-using, they remain confined to narrow domains. We propose that future AI agents should synthesize the strengths of these specialized systems into a unified framework capable of operating across text, vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, emotional intelligence, and beyond. This integration is not only feasible but also essential for achieving the versatility and adaptability that characterize human intelligence. The convergence of technologies across AI domains, coupled with increasing user demand for cross-domain capabilities, suggests that such integration is within reach. Ultimately, the development of these versatile agents is a critical step toward realizing AGI. This paper explores the rationale for this shift, potential pathways for achieving it.

Abstract: Aiming at the group decision - making problem with multi - objective attributes, this study proposes a group decision - making system that integrates fuzzy inference and Bayesian network. A fuzzy rule base is constructed by combining threshold values, membership functions, expert experience, and domain knowledge to address quantitative challenges such as scale differences and expert linguistic variables. A hierarchical Bayesian network is designed, featuring a directed acyclic graph with nodes selected by experts, and maximum likelihood estimation is used to dynamically optimize the conditional probability table, modeling the nonlinear correlations among multidimensional indices for posterior probability aggregation. In a comprehensive student evaluation case, this method is compared with the traditional weighted scoring approach. The results indicate that the proposed method demonstrates effectiveness in both rule criterion construction and ranking consistency, with a classification accuracy of 86.0% and an F1 value improvement of 53.4% over the traditional method. Additionally, computational experiments on real - world datasets across various group decision scenarios assess the method's performance and robustness, providing evidence of its reliability in diverse contexts.

Abstract: Achieving safe autonomous navigation systems is critical for deploying robots in dynamic and uncertain real-world environments. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical control framework leveraging neural network verification techniques to design control barrier functions (CBFs) and policy correction mechanisms that ensure safe reinforcement learning navigation policies. Our approach relies on probabilistic enumeration to identify unsafe regions of operation, which are then used to construct a safe CBF-based control layer applicable to arbitrary policies. We validate our framework both in simulation and on a real robot, using a standard mobile robot benchmark and a highly dynamic aquatic environmental monitoring task. These experiments demonstrate the ability of the proposed solution to correct unsafe actions while preserving efficient navigation behavior. Our results show the promise of developing hierarchical verification-based systems to enable safe and robust navigation behaviors in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, long-thought reasoning models achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, but often incur substantial inference overhead, making efficiency a critical concern. Our empirical analysis reveals that the benefit of using Long-CoT varies across problems: while some problems require elaborate reasoning, others show no improvement, or even degraded accuracy. This motivates adaptive reasoning strategies that tailor reasoning depth to the input. However, prior work primarily reduces redundancy within long reasoning paths, limiting exploration of more efficient strategies beyond the Long-CoT paradigm. To address this, we propose a novel two-stage framework for adaptive and efficient reasoning. First, we construct a hybrid reasoning model by merging long and short CoT models to enable diverse reasoning styles. Second, we apply bi-level preference training to guide the model to select suitable reasoning styles (group-level), and prefer concise and correct reasoning within each style group (instance-level). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces inference costs compared to other baseline approaches, while maintaining performance. Notably, on five mathematical datasets, the average length of reasoning is reduced by more than 50%, highlighting the potential of adaptive strategies to optimize reasoning efficiency in large language models. Our code is coming soon at https://github.com/StarDewXXX/AdaR1

<div> Keywords: abstract argumentation, ranking, extension semantics, plausibility, acceptance

Summary:
Extension-ranking semantics is proposed as a framework for ranking sets of arguments in abstract argumentation based on their plausibility of acceptance. This approach generalizes Dung's extension semantics by introducing a preorder over the power set of arguments. To evaluate extension-ranking semantics, principles are established to ensure well-behaved semantics. Simple base relations representing different aspects of argumentative reasoning are combined to create a family of extension-ranking semantics. Various approaches for ranking extensions are adapted for use in this context. The study evaluates the behavior of these adapted ranking methods. The proposed framework offers a systematic way to rank arguments in abstract argumentation, providing a structured approach to evaluating the acceptance of sets of arguments. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a general framework for ranking sets of arguments in abstract argumentation based on their plausibility of acceptance. We present a generalisation of Dung's extension semantics as extension-ranking semantics, which induce a preorder over the power set of all arguments, allowing us to state that one set is "closer" to being acceptable than another. To evaluate the extension-ranking semantics, we introduce a number of principles that a well-behaved extension-ranking semantics should satisfy. We consider several simple base relations, each of which models a single central aspect of argumentative reasoning. The combination of these base relations provides us with a family of extension-ranking semantics. We also adapt a number of approaches from the literature for ranking extensions to be usable in the context of extension-ranking semantics, and evaluate their behaviour.

This article discusses the challenges faced when using AutomationML, an XML-based data exchange format in the automation domain, and proposes a solution through ontology and RDF mapping. The article provides practitioners with an up-to-date ontology of AutomationML concepts and a declarative mapping to transform AutomationML models into RDF triples. By converting AutomationML to OWL, practitioners can integrate AutomationML information into industrial knowledge graphs more efficiently. The study shows that transforming AutomationML to OWL enables powerful querying and validation capabilities that are not possible with the original format. This approach enhances the applicability of AutomationML data in various applications, making it easier for practitioners to work with the information effectively. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: AutomationML has seen widespread adoption as an open data exchange format in the automation domain. It is an open and vendor neutral standard based on the extensible markup language XML. However, AutomationML extends XML with additional semantics, that limit the applicability of common XML-tools for applications like querying or data validation. This article provides practitioners with 1) an up-to-date ontology of the concepts in the AutomationML-standard, as well as 2) a declarative mapping to automatically transform any AutomationML model into RDF triples. Together, these artifacts allow practitioners an easy integration of AutomationML information into industrial knowledge graphs. A study on examples from the automation domain concludes that transforming AutomationML to OWL opens up new powerful ways for querying and validation that are impossible without transformation.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel communication-efficient collaborative perception framework for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) called LIF. LIF leverages late-intermediate fusion, VPE, and BoBEV to integrate information from multiple agents at the feature representation level. It introduces an uncertainty-driven communication mechanism that selects high-quality shared areas based on uncertainty evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that LIF outperforms existing methods with minimal communication bandwidth, showcasing its effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances environmental awareness through inter-agent communication and is regarded as a promising solution to intelligent transportation systems. However, existing collaborative methods for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) overlook the unique characteristics of the UAV perspective, resulting in substantial communication overhead. To address this issue, we propose a novel communication-efficient collaborative perception framework based on late-intermediate fusion, dubbed LIF. The core concept is to exchange informative and compact detection results and shift the fusion stage to the feature representation level. In particular, we leverage vision-guided positional embedding (VPE) and box-based virtual augmented feature (BoBEV) to effectively integrate complementary information from various agents. Additionally, we innovatively introduce an uncertainty-driven communication mechanism that uses uncertainty evaluation to select high-quality and reliable shared areas. Experimental results demonstrate that our LIF achieves superior performance with minimal communication bandwidth, proving its effectiveness and practicality. Code and models are available at https://github.com/uestchjw/LIF.

<div> Keywords: intuitive thinking, large language models, cognitive dynamics, Transition-Inducing Prompt, conceptual fusion<br />
Summary: 
The study investigates the cognitive dynamics of humans and large language models (LLMs) by comparing their responsiveness to prompts triggering rapid shifts. A two-part framework is proposed using Transition-Inducing Prompts (TIPs) and Transition Quantifying Prompts (TQPs) to analyze LLM behavior. Controlled experiments were conducted using prompts embedding semantically distant concepts, both fused together and presented separately, to observe changes in linguistic quality and affective tone in LLM responses. While humans show heightened engagement with meaningfully blended concepts, LLMs do not exhibit significant differences in responsiveness. This suggests LLMs may not replicate human conceptual integration processes, indicating potential differences in how intuition and conceptual leaps emerge in artificial versus human minds. The proposed method allows for precise measurement of cognitive responsiveness, shedding light on the distinctions between artificial and human thinking processes.

Abstract: What underlies intuitive human thinking? One approach to this question is to compare the cognitive dynamics of humans and large language models (LLMs). However, such a comparison requires a method to quantitatively analyze AI cognitive behavior under controlled conditions. While anecdotal observations suggest that certain prompts can dramatically change LLM behavior, these observations have remained largely qualitative. Here, we propose a two-part framework to investigate this phenomenon: a Transition-Inducing Prompt (TIP) that triggers a rapid shift in LLM responsiveness, and a Transition Quantifying Prompt (TQP) that evaluates this change using a separate LLM. Through controlled experiments, we examined how LLMs react to prompts embedding two semantically distant concepts (e.g., mathematical aperiodicity and traditional crafts)--either fused together or presented separately--by changing their linguistic quality and affective tone. Whereas humans tend to experience heightened engagement when such concepts are meaningfully blended producing a novel concept--a form of conceptual fusion--current LLMs showed no significant difference in responsiveness between semantically fused and non-fused prompts. This suggests that LLMs may not yet replicate the conceptual integration processes seen in human intuition. Our method enables fine-grained, reproducible measurement of cognitive responsiveness, and may help illuminate key differences in how intuition and conceptual leaps emerge in artificial versus human minds.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated feedback in educational settings has garnered considerable attention due to its potential to enhance learning outcomes. However, a comprehensive understanding of the linguistic characteristics of AI-generated feedback, including readability, lexical richness, and adaptability across varying challenge levels, remains limited. This study delves into the linguistic and structural attributes of feedback generated by Google's Gemini 1.5-flash text model for computer science multiple-choice questions (MCQs). A dataset of over 1,200 MCQs was analyzed, considering three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) and three feedback tones (supportive, neutral, challenging). Key linguistic metrics, such as length, readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level), vocabulary richness, and lexical density, were computed and examined. A fine-tuned RoBERTa-based multi-task learning (MTL) model was trained to predict these linguistic properties, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.0 for readability and 0.03 for vocabulary richness. The findings reveal significant interaction effects between feedback tone and question difficulty, demonstrating the dynamic adaptation of AI-generated feedback within diverse educational contexts. These insights contribute to the development of more personalized and effective AI-driven feedback mechanisms, highlighting the potential for improved learning outcomes while underscoring the importance of ethical considerations in their design and deployment.

Abstract: The growing popularity of large language models has raised concerns regarding the potential to misuse AI-generated text (AIGT). It becomes increasingly critical to establish an excellent AIGT detection method with high generalization and robustness. However, existing methods either focus on model generalization or concentrate on robustness. The unified mechanism, to simultaneously address the challenges of generalization and robustness, is less explored. In this paper, we argue that robustness can be view as a specific form of domain shift, and empirically reveal an intrinsic mechanism for model generalization of AIGT detection task. Then, we proposed a novel AIGT detection method (DP-Net) via dynamic perturbations introduced by a reinforcement learning with elaborated reward and action. Experimentally, extensive results show that the proposed DP-Net significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art AIGT detection methods for generalization capacity in three cross-domain scenarios. Meanwhile, the DP-Net achieves best robustness under two text adversarial attacks. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/CAU-ISS-Lab/AIGT-Detection-Evade-Detection/tree/main/DP-Net.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, generating high-quality text that balances coherence, diversity, and relevance remains challenging. Traditional decoding methods, such as bean search and top-k sampling, often struggle with either repetitive or incoherent outputs, particularly in tasks that require long-form text generation. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a novel enhancement of the well-known Contrastive Search algorithm, Context-Enhanced Contrastive Search (CECS) with contextual calibration. The proposed scheme introduces several novelties including dynamic contextual importance weighting, multi-level Contrastive Search, and adaptive temperature control, to optimize the balance between fluency, creativity, and precision. The performance of CECS is evaluated using several standard metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and semantic similarity. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both coherence and relevance of the generated texts by CECS outperforming the existing Contrastive Search techniques. The proposed algorithm has several potential applications in the real world including legal document drafting, customer service chatbots, and content marketing.

Summary:
ConformalNL2LTL introduces a method for translating Natural Language instructions into Linear Temporal Logic formulas with user-defined success rates. The approach iteratively constructs LTL formulas by addressing open-vocabulary Question-Answering problems using Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging conformal prediction, the method can quantify uncertainty in LLM-generated answers, allowing it to proceed with translation only when confident and request assistance otherwise. Theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that ConformalNL2LTL achieves specified translation accuracy while minimizing the need for help.

Abstract: Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) has become a prevalent specification language for robotic tasks. To mitigate the significant manual effort and expertise required to define LTL-encoded tasks, several methods have been proposed for translating Natural Language (NL) instructions into LTL formulas, which, however, lack correctness guarantees. To address this, we introduce a new NL-to-LTL translation method, called ConformalNL2LTL, that can achieve user-defined translation success rates over unseen NL commands. Our method constructs LTL formulas iteratively by addressing a sequence of open-vocabulary Question-Answering (QA) problems with LLMs. To enable uncertainty-aware translation, we leverage conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool for black-box models. CP enables our method to assess the uncertainty in LLM-generated answers, allowing it to proceed with translation when sufficiently confident and request help otherwise. We provide both theoretical and empirical results demonstrating that ConformalNL2LTL achieves user-specified translation accuracy while minimizing help rates.

Summary: <div>

Abstract: With the growing presence of multilingual users on social media, detecting abusive language in code-mixed text has become increasingly challenging. Code-mixed communication, where users seamlessly switch between English and their native languages, poses difficulties for traditional abuse detection models, as offensive content may be context-dependent or obscured by linguistic blending. While abusive language detection has been extensively explored for high-resource languages like English and Hindi, low-resource languages such as Telugu and Nepali remain underrepresented, leaving gaps in effective moderation. In this study, we introduce a novel, manually annotated dataset of 2 thousand Telugu-English and 5 Nepali-English code-mixed comments, categorized as abusive and non-abusive, collected from various social media platforms. The dataset undergoes rigorous preprocessing before being evaluated across multiple Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Large Language Models (LLMs). We experimented with models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks (NN), LSTM, CNN, and LLMs, optimizing their performance through hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate it using 10-fold cross-validation and statistical significance testing (t-test). Our findings provide key insights into the challenges of detecting abusive language in code-mixed settings and offer a comparative analysis of computational approaches. This study contributes to advancing NLP for low-resource languages by establishing benchmarks for abusive language detection in Telugu-English and Nepali-English code-mixed text. The dataset and insights can aid in the development of more robust moderation strategies for multilingual social media environments.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) holds promise for revolutionizing various fields traditionally dominated by human expertise. Urban planning, a professional discipline that fundamentally shapes our daily surroundings, is one such field heavily relying on multifaceted domain knowledge and experience of human experts. The extent to which LLMs can assist human practitioners in urban planning remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark, UrbanPlanBench, tailored to evaluate the efficacy of LLMs in urban planning, which encompasses fundamental principles, professional knowledge, and management and regulations, aligning closely with the qualifications expected of human planners. Through extensive evaluation, we reveal a significant imbalance in the acquisition of planning knowledge among LLMs, with even the most proficient models falling short of meeting professional standards. For instance, we observe that 70% of LLMs achieve subpar performance in understanding planning regulations compared to other aspects. Besides the benchmark, we present the largest-ever supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset, UrbanPlanText, comprising over 30,000 instruction pairs sourced from urban planning exams and textbooks. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuned models exhibit enhanced performance in memorization tests and comprehension of urban planning knowledge, while there exists significant room for improvement, particularly in tasks requiring domain-specific terminology and reasoning. By making our benchmark, dataset, and associated evaluation and fine-tuning toolsets publicly available at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/PlanBench, we aim to catalyze the integration of LLMs into practical urban planning, fostering a symbiotic collaboration between human expertise and machine intelligence.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of malware variants requires robust classification methods to enhance cybersecurity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for generating malware descriptions to aid family classification, their utility is limited by semantic embedding overlaps and misalignment with binary behavioral features. We propose a contrastive fine-tuning (CFT) method that refines LLM embeddings via targeted selection of hard negative samples based on cosine similarity, enabling LLMs to distinguish between closely related malware families. Our approach combines high-similarity negatives to enhance discriminative power and mid-tier negatives to increase embedding diversity, optimizing both precision and generalization. Evaluated on the CIC-AndMal-2020 and BODMAS datasets, our refined embeddings are integrated into a multimodal classifier within a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework on a few-shot setting. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements: our method achieves 63.15% classification accuracy with as few as 20 samples on CIC-AndMal-2020, outperforming baselines by 11--21 percentage points and surpassing prior negative sampling strategies. Ablation studies confirm the superiority of similarity-based selection over random sampling, with gains of 10-23%. Additionally, fine-tuned LLMs generate attribute-aware descriptions that generalize to unseen variants, bridging textual and binary feature gaps. This work advances malware classification by enabling nuanced semantic distinctions and provides a scalable framework for adapting LLMs to cybersecurity challenges.

<div> Keywords: PICO framework, transformer architecture, prompt injection attacks, cybersecurity, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)

Summary:
The PICO framework is proposed to enhance cybersecurity in transformers by structurally separating trusted instructions from untrusted inputs. It utilizes dual channels processed independently and merged through a controlled fusion mechanism. The integration of a Security Expert Agent within a Mixture-of-Experts framework and a Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph provides domain-specific reasoning. Training ensures the system prompt branch remains unaltered while handling adversarial inputs safely. The mathematical formulation, transformer architecture specifics, and hypothetical case studies, including Policy Puppetry attacks, illustrate the PICO framework's effectiveness. Implementing transformers with a PICO-based approach from scratch is recommended, but a cost-effective fine-tuning method is also presented. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
1. PICO framework separates trusted and untrusted inputs to mitigate prompt injection attacks.
2. Dual channels and controlled fusion mechanism ensure reliable response generation.
3. Integration of Security Expert Agent and Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph enhances domain-specific reasoning.
4. Training design maintains system prompt integrity while handling adversarial inputs safely.
5. Effective implementation involves training transformers with the PICO framework from scratch or using a cost-effective fine-tuning approach. <div>

Abstract: We propose a robust transformer architecture designed to prevent prompt injection attacks and ensure secure, reliable response generation. Our PICO (Prompt Isolation and Cybersecurity Oversight) framework structurally separates trusted system instructions from untrusted user inputs through dual channels that are processed independently and merged only by a controlled, gated fusion mechanism. In addition, we integrate a specialized Security Expert Agent within a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework and incorporate a Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph (CKG) to supply domain-specific reasoning. Our training design further ensures that the system prompt branch remains immutable while the rest of the network learns to handle adversarial inputs safely. This PICO framework is presented via a general mathematical formulation, then elaborated in terms of the specifics of transformer architecture, and fleshed out via hypothetical case studies including Policy Puppetry attacks. While the most effective implementation may involve training transformers in a PICO-based way from scratch, we also present a cost-effective fine-tuning approach.

Summary:<br />
The perceived quality of explanations in e-government services is essential for building trust and increasing usage. Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate content generation for explanations, but selecting the right type of LLM is challenging. A scale was adapted to compare the quality of explanations generated by different LLMs, using tax refund decisions as a case study. A user study with 128 respondents was conducted to rate LLM-generated explanations, aiding in selecting the most suitable LLM. To automate the feedback process, advanced predictive techniques were explored. This research contributes to improving the effectiveness of explanations in e-government services and showcases the potential of LLMs in enhancing user experience and trust. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The perceived quality of the explanations accompanying e-government services is key to gaining trust in these institutions, consequently amplifying further usage of these services. Recent advances in generative AI, and concretely in Large Language Models (LLMs) allow the automation of such content articulations, eliciting explanations' interpretability and fidelity, and more generally, adapting content to various audiences. However, selecting the right LLM type for this has become a non-trivial task for e-government service providers. In this work, we adapted a previously developed scale to assist with this selection, providing a systematic approach for the comparative analysis of the perceived quality of explanations generated by various LLMs. We further demonstrated its applicability through the tax-return process, using it as an exemplar use case that could benefit from employing an LLM to generate explanations about tax refund decisions. This was attained through a user study with 128 survey respondents who were asked to rate different versions of LLM-generated explanations about tax refund decisions, providing a methodological basis for selecting the most appropriate LLM. Recognizing the practical challenges of conducting such a survey, we also began exploring the automation of this process by attempting to replicate human feedback using a selection of cutting-edge predictive techniques.

Abstract: Traditional 3D modeling requires technical expertise, specialized software, and time-intensive processes, making it inaccessible for many users. Our research aims to lower these barriers by combining generative AI and augmented reality (AR) into a cohesive system that allows users to easily generate, manipulate, and interact with 3D models in real time, directly within AR environments.

Summary: 
The paper introduces SAGA, a Security Architecture for Governing Agentic systems, to offer users oversight over their agents' lifecycle. Users register their agents with a central entity, the Provider, which maintains contact information and access control policies. SAGA employs a cryptographic mechanism for deriving access control tokens, providing fine-grained control over agent interactions. Evaluation on various tasks and conditions shows minimal performance overhead without impacting task utility. SAGA enables the secure deployment of autonomous agents, promoting responsible adoption in sensitive environments. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents increasingly interact, collaborate, and delegate tasks to one another autonomously with minimal human interaction. Industry guidelines for agentic system governance emphasize the need for users to maintain comprehensive control over their agents, mitigating potential damage from malicious agents. Several proposed agentic system designs address agent identity, authorization, and delegation, but remain purely theoretical, without concrete implementation and evaluation. Most importantly, they do not provide user-controlled agent management. To address this gap, we propose SAGA, a Security Architecture for Governing Agentic systems, that offers user oversight over their agents' lifecycle. In our design, users register their agents with a central entity, the Provider, that maintains agents contact information, user-defined access control policies, and helps agents enforce these policies on inter-agent communication. We introduce a cryptographic mechanism for deriving access control tokens, that offers fine-grained control over an agent's interaction with other agents, balancing security and performance consideration. We evaluate SAGA on several agentic tasks, using agents in different geolocations, and multiple on-device and cloud LLMs, demonstrating minimal performance overhead with no impact on underlying task utility in a wide range of conditions. Our architecture enables secure and trustworthy deployment of autonomous agents, accelerating the responsible adoption of this technology in sensitive environments.

<div> fine-tuning, language models, differential privacy, privacy risks, utility degradation  
Summary:  
Differential privacy (DP) was investigated in the context of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), revealing varying impacts on model utility across different fine-tuning methods. Privacy risks differed significantly among non-DP fine-tuning approaches. Applying DP, even with a high budget, notably reduced privacy risk. The trade-off between privacy and utility under DP varied greatly among fine-tuning methods, with some methods suffering severe utility degradation. These findings offer insights for deploying LLMs with privacy in mind and suggest avenues for optimizing the privacy-utility balance in fine-tuning techniques. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has become an essential strategy for adapting them to specialized tasks; however, this process introduces significant privacy challenges, as sensitive training data may be inadvertently memorized and exposed. Although differential privacy (DP) offers strong theoretical guarantees against such leakage, its empirical privacy effectiveness on LLMs remains unclear, especially under different fine-tuning methods. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of DP across fine-tuning methods and privacy budgets, using both data extraction and membership inference attacks to assess empirical privacy risks. Our main findings are as follows: (1) Differential privacy reduces model utility, but its impact varies significantly across different fine-tuning methods. (2) Without DP, the privacy risks of models fine-tuned with different approaches differ considerably. (3) When DP is applied, even a relatively high privacy budget can substantially lower privacy risk. (4) The privacy-utility trade-off under DP training differs greatly among fine-tuning methods, with some methods being unsuitable for DP due to severe utility degradation. Our results provide practical guidance for privacy-conscious deployment of LLMs and pave the way for future research on optimizing the privacy-utility trade-off in fine-tuning methodologies.

Abstract: Early detection of security bug reports (SBRs) is crucial for preventing vulnerabilities and ensuring system reliability. While machine learning models have been developed for SBR prediction, their predictive performance still has room for improvement. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between BERT and Random Forest (RF), a competitive baseline for predicting SBRs. The results show that RF outperforms BERT with a 34% higher average G-measure for within-project predictions. Adding only SBRs from various projects improves both models' average performance. However, including both security and nonsecurity bug reports significantly reduces RF's average performance to 46%, while boosts BERT to its best average performance of 66%, surpassing RF. In cross-project SBR prediction, BERT achieves a remarkable 62% G-measure, which is substantially higher than RF.

Summary: <br />
This paper discusses the vulnerability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to adversarial attacks, specifically jailbreak methods that can bypass their safety protocols and generate harmful content or reveal sensitive data. The authors introduce a novel jailbreak attack method that leverages the prefilling feature of LLMs to manipulate the output by controlling the probability distribution of subsequent tokens. Two attack variants, Static Prefilling (SP) and Optimized Prefilling (OP), are proposed and tested on six state-of-the-art LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark. The experiments show that the OP method can achieve high attack success rates, outperforming baseline methods. The study emphasizes the importance of robust content validation mechanisms to prevent the exploitation of prefilling features in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are designed to generate helpful and safe content. However, adversarial attacks, commonly referred to as jailbreak, can bypass their safety protocols, prompting LLMs to generate harmful content or reveal sensitive data. Consequently, investigating jailbreak methodologies is crucial for exposing systemic vulnerabilities within LLMs, ultimately guiding the continuous implementation of security enhancements by developers. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak attack method that leverages the prefilling feature of LLMs, a feature designed to enhance model output constraints. Unlike traditional jailbreak methods, the proposed attack circumvents LLMs' safety mechanisms by directly manipulating the probability distribution of subsequent tokens, thereby exerting control over the model's output. We propose two attack variants: Static Prefilling (SP), which employs a universal prefill text, and Optimized Prefilling (OP), which iteratively optimizes the prefill text to maximize the attack success rate. Experiments on six state-of-the-art LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark validate the effectiveness of our method and demonstrate its capability to substantially enhance attack success rates when combined with existing jailbreak approaches. The OP method achieved attack success rates of up to 99.82% on certain models, significantly outperforming baseline methods. This work introduces a new jailbreak attack method in LLMs, emphasizing the need for robust content validation mechanisms to mitigate the adversarial exploitation of prefilling features. All code and data used in this paper are publicly available.

Abstract: The growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has amplified concerns about trustworthiness, including integrity, privacy, robustness, and bias. To assess and attribute these threats, we propose ConceptLens, a generic framework that leverages pre-trained multimodal models to identify the root causes of integrity threats by analyzing Concept Shift in probing samples. ConceptLens demonstrates strong detection performance for vanilla data poisoning attacks and uncovers vulnerabilities to bias injection, such as the generation of covert advertisements through malicious concept shifts. It identifies privacy risks in unaltered but high-risk samples, filters them before training, and provides insights into model weaknesses arising from incomplete or imbalanced training data. Additionally, at the model level, it attributes concepts that the target model is overly dependent on, identifies misleading concepts, and explains how disrupting key concepts negatively impacts the model. Furthermore, it uncovers sociological biases in generative content, revealing disparities across sociological contexts. Strikingly, ConceptLens reveals how safe training and inference data can be unintentionally and easily exploited, potentially undermining safety alignment. Our study informs actionable insights to breed trust in AI systems, thereby speeding adoption and driving greater innovation.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, security vulnerabilities, smart contracts, CodeBC, fine-tuning approach 

Summary:
CodeBC is a code generation model developed to enhance security in smart contract development for blockchain. Unlike previous methods that rely on manually labeled vulnerability data, CodeBC uses a three-stage fine-tuning approach based on CodeLlama. Instead of pairwise vulnerability location annotations, CodeBC leverages vulnerability and security tags to teach the model the differences between vulnerable and secure code. During the inference phase, the model uses security tags to generate secure and robust code. Experimental results show that CodeBC outperforms baseline models in terms of BLEU, CodeBLEU, and compilation pass rates while reducing vulnerability rates significantly. This approach proves to be effective and cost-efficient, signaling CodeBC as a promising solution for generating secure smart contract code. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.21043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language instructions, yet they often lack an understanding of security vulnerabilities. This limitation makes it difficult for LLMs to avoid security risks in generated code, particularly in high-security programming tasks such as smart contract development for blockchain. Researchers have attempted to enhance the vulnerability awareness of these models by training them to differentiate between vulnerable and fixed code snippets. However, this approach relies heavily on manually labeled vulnerability data, which is only available for popular languages like Python and C++. For low-resource languages like Solidity, used in smart contracts, large-scale annotated datasets are scarce and difficult to obtain. To address this challenge, we introduce CodeBC, a code generation model specifically designed for generating secure smart contracts in blockchain. CodeBC employs a three-stage fine-tuning approach based on CodeLlama, distinguishing itself from previous methods by not relying on pairwise vulnerability location annotations. Instead, it leverages vulnerability and security tags to teach the model the differences between vulnerable and secure code. During the inference phase, the model leverages security tags to generate secure and robust code. Experimental results demonstrate that CodeBC outperforms baseline models in terms of BLEU, CodeBLEU, and compilation pass rates, while significantly reducing vulnerability rates. These findings validate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of our three-stage fine-tuning strategy, making CodeBC a promising solution for generating secure smart contract code.

<div> Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Model Theft, Watermarking, Adversarial Attacks, Multimodal Models

Summary: 
The paper introduces AGATE, a Model-Agnostic Black-box Backdoor Watermarking Framework designed to address challenges in protecting copyright for large-scale AI models. By generating stealthy adversarial triggers from ordinary datasets, AGATE ensures visual fidelity while inducing semantic shifts, enhancing the model's stealthiness and robustness against watermark evasion. A post-transform module helps correct model outputs, closing the gap between adversarial trigger image embedding and text embedding to prevent anomaly detection. The proposed two-phase watermark verification process compares model results with and without the transform module to determine copyright infringement accurately. AGATE outperforms existing methods in multimodal image-text retrieval and image classification tasks across multiple datasets. Furthermore, the framework demonstrates robustness against adversarial attacks, showcasing its effectiveness in securing multimodal AI models from unauthorized use. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.21044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancement in large-scale Artificial Intelligence (AI) models offering multimodal services have become foundational in AI systems, making them prime targets for model theft. Existing methods select Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data as backdoor watermarks and retrain the original model for copyright protection. However, existing methods are susceptible to malicious detection and forgery by adversaries, resulting in watermark evasion. In this work, we propose Model-\underline{ag}nostic Black-box Backdoor W\underline{ate}rmarking Framework (AGATE) to address stealthiness and robustness challenges in multimodal model copyright protection. Specifically, we propose an adversarial trigger generation method to generate stealthy adversarial triggers from ordinary dataset, providing visual fidelity while inducing semantic shifts. To alleviate the issue of anomaly detection among model outputs, we propose a post-transform module to correct the model output by narrowing the distance between adversarial trigger image embedding and text embedding. Subsequently, a two-phase watermark verification is proposed to judge whether the current model infringes by comparing the two results with and without the transform module. Consequently, we consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods across five datasets in the downstream tasks of multimodal image-text retrieval and image classification. Additionally, we validated the robustness of AGATE under two adversarial attack scenarios.

Summary:
- The research discusses the persistent threat of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and the importance of effectively detecting and protecting systems from them.
- Traditional ML models trained on non-obfuscated XSS data struggle to accurately identify obfuscated XSS threats, highlighting the need for diverse training data.

- The obfuscated samples generated by the LLMs were significantly more complex than those produced by existing tools, enhancing the model's capability to handle advanced XSS attacks effectively, making it more suitable for real-world application security.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.21045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a critical security vulnerability. Despite decades of research, XSS remains among the top 10 security vulnerabilities. Researchers have proposed various techniques to protect systems from XSS attacks, with machine learning (ML) being one of the most widely used methods. An ML model is trained on a dataset to identify potential XSS threats, making its effectiveness highly dependent on the size and diversity of the training data. A variation of XSS is obfuscated XSS, where attackers apply obfuscation techniques to alter the code's structure, making it challenging for security systems to detect its malicious intent. Our study's random forest model was trained on traditional (non-obfuscated) XSS data achieved 99.8% accuracy. However, when tested against obfuscated XSS samples, accuracy dropped to 81.9%, underscoring the importance of training ML models with obfuscated data to improve their effectiveness in detecting XSS attacks. A significant challenge is to generate highly complex obfuscated code despite the availability of several public tools. These tools can only produce obfuscation up to certain levels of complexity.
  In our proposed system, we fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate complex obfuscated XSS payloads automatically. By transforming original XSS samples into diverse obfuscated variants, we create challenging training data for ML model evaluation. Our approach achieved a 99.5% accuracy rate with the obfuscated dataset. We also found that the obfuscated samples generated by the LLMs were 28.1% more complex than those created by other tools, significantly improving the model's ability to handle advanced XSS attacks and making it more effective for real-world application security.

Summary:<br /><br />
This study introduces a novel framework that combines evolution and individual learning to train artificial neural networks. By incorporating an "outer loop" of evolution before the standard training procedure, artificial networks can better mimic the effects of evolution and learning seen in biological organisms. In an experiment focused on language, a model with an inherited "connectome" from evolution outperformed control models on natural language processing tasks, alignment with human behavior, and brain data. This suggests that a model connectome can serve as a strong prior for learning in situations with limited data, bridging the gap between artificial models and biologically evolved neural networks. By integrating biological principles into artificial network training, this approach shows promise for improving the performance and efficiency of artificial neural networks. <div>

Abstract: Biological neural networks are shaped both by evolution across generations and by individual learning within an organism's lifetime, whereas standard artificial neural networks undergo a single, large training procedure without inherited constraints. In this preliminary work, we propose a framework that incorporates this crucial generational dimension - an "outer loop" of evolution that shapes the "inner loop" of learning - so that artificial networks better mirror the effects of evolution and individual learning in biological organisms. Focusing on language, we train a model that inherits a "model connectome" from the outer evolution loop before exposing it to a developmental-scale corpus of 100M tokens. Compared with two closely matched control models, we show that the connectome model performs better or on par on natural language processing tasks as well as alignment to human behavior and brain data. These findings suggest that a model connectome serves as an efficient prior for learning in low-data regimes - narrowing the gap between single-generation artificial models and biologically evolved neural networks.

<div> target-specific, stealthy, deep neural networks, backdoor attacks, black-box settings
Summary:<br /><br />Multi-target backdoor attacks on deep neural networks pose significant security risks as they can preset multiple target classes through a single injection. Existing methods face challenges in achieving trigger specificity and stealthiness in black-box settings, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, the proposed Spatial-based Full-target Invisible Backdoor Attack (SFIBA) ensures triggers are restricted to specific local spatial regions for target classes and employs a frequency-domain-based injection method for stealthiness. By integrating trigger features through fast fourier transform, discrete wavelet transform, and singular value decomposition, SFIBA achieves excellent attack performance and stealthiness while maintaining model performance on benign samples. Experimental results demonstrate SFIBA's effectiveness in bypassing existing backdoor defenses on various datasets and models. <div>
arXiv:2504.21052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-target backdoor attacks pose significant security threats to deep neural networks, as they can preset multiple target classes through a single backdoor injection. This allows attackers to control the model to misclassify poisoned samples with triggers into any desired target class during inference, exhibiting superior attack performance compared with conventional backdoor attacks. However, existing multi-target backdoor attacks fail to guarantee trigger specificity and stealthiness in black-box settings, resulting in two main issues. First, they are unable to simultaneously target all classes when only training data can be manipulated, limiting their effectiveness in realistic attack scenarios. Second, the triggers often lack visual imperceptibility, making poisoned samples easy to detect. To address these problems, we propose a Spatial-based Full-target Invisible Backdoor Attack, called SFIBA. It restricts triggers for different classes to specific local spatial regions and morphologies in the pixel space to ensure specificity, while employing a frequency-domain-based trigger injection method to guarantee stealthiness. Specifically, for injection of each trigger, we first apply fast fourier transform to obtain the amplitude spectrum of clean samples in local spatial regions. Then, we employ discrete wavelet transform to extract the features from the amplitude spectrum and use singular value decomposition to integrate the trigger. Subsequently, we selectively filter parts of the trigger in pixel space to implement trigger morphology constraints and adjust injection coefficients based on visual effects. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets and models. The results demonstrate that SFIBA can achieve excellent attack performance and stealthiness, while preserving the model's performance on benign samples, and can also bypass existing backdoor defenses.

<div> Keywords: Safety alignment, large language models, neuron activation analysis, similarity-based neuron identification, adversarial fine-tuning attacks

Summary:
Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) involves fine-tuning mechanisms to regulate neuron activations for suppressing harmful content. This study introduces a novel approach to induce disalignment by identifying and modifying neurons responsible for safety constraints. The proposed method includes three main steps: Neuron Activation Analysis detects critical neurons for distinguishing harmful and harmless inputs; Similarity-Based Neuron Identification locates neurons responsible for safe alignment systematically; Neuron Relearning for Safety Removal fine-tunes selected neurons to restore the model's ability to generate restricted responses. Experimental results validate the efficacy of this method in removing safety constraints with minimal fine-tuning, revealing a significant vulnerability in current alignment techniques. The study emphasizes the importance of robust defense strategies to combat adversarial fine-tuning attacks on LLMs.

Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) is achieved through fine-tuning mechanisms that regulate neuron activations to suppress harmful content. In this work, we propose a novel approach to induce disalignment by identifying and modifying the neurons responsible for safety constraints. Our method consists of three key steps: Neuron Activation Analysis, where we examine activation patterns in response to harmful and harmless prompts to detect neurons that are critical for distinguishing between harmful and harmless inputs; Similarity-Based Neuron Identification, which systematically locates the neurons responsible for safe alignment; and Neuron Relearning for Safety Removal, where we fine-tune these selected neurons to restore the model's ability to generate previously restricted responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively removes safety constraints with minimal fine-tuning, highlighting a critical vulnerability in current alignment techniques. Our findings underscore the need for robust defenses against adversarial fine-tuning attacks on LLMs.

Summary:
Feature-based Full-target Clean-label Backdoor Attacks (FFCBA) propose a novel approach to launching stealthy and effective backdoor attacks on deep neural networks. The FFCBA consists of two paradigms: Feature-Spanning Backdoor Attacks (FSBA) and Feature-Migrating Backdoor Attacks (FMBA). FSBA utilizes class-conditional autoencoders to generate noise triggers that maintain consistency and specificity within and across classes. On the other hand, FMBA employs a two-stage training process to generate triggers with strong target-class features for effective cross-model attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that FFCBA achieves exceptional attack performance while maintaining robustness against existing backdoor defense mechanisms. This approach opens up possibilities for more efficient and scalable multi-target backdoor attacks in the clean-label setting. <div>

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks, as backdoored models would misclassify poisoned samples with specific triggers into target classes while maintaining normal performance on clean samples. Among these, multi-target backdoor attacks can simultaneously target multiple classes. However, existing multi-target backdoor attacks all follow the dirty-label paradigm, where poisoned samples are mislabeled, and most of them require an extremely high poisoning rate. This makes them easily detectable by manual inspection. In contrast, clean-label attacks are more stealthy, as they avoid modifying the labels of poisoned samples. However, they generally struggle to achieve stable and satisfactory attack performance and often fail to scale effectively to multi-target attacks. To address this issue, we propose the Feature-based Full-target Clean-label Backdoor Attacks (FFCBA) which consists of two paradigms: Feature-Spanning Backdoor Attacks (FSBA) and Feature-Migrating Backdoor Attacks (FMBA). FSBA leverages class-conditional autoencoders to generate noise triggers that align perturbed in-class samples with the original category's features, ensuring the effectiveness, intra-class consistency, inter-class specificity and natural-feature correlation of triggers. While FSBA supports swift and efficient attacks, its cross-model attack capability is relatively weak. FMBA employs a two-stage class-conditional autoencoder training process that alternates between using out-of-class samples and in-class samples. This allows FMBA to generate triggers with strong target-class features, making it highly effective for cross-model attacks. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets and models, the results show that FFCBA achieves outstanding attack performance and maintains desirable robustness against the state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

<div> Keywords: deep learning, semantic communications, performance analysis, power control, energy efficiency

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) formula to model the relationship between end-to-end measurement and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in deep learning-based semantic communications. The formula is applicable for both image reconstruction and inference tasks and can fit various DL networks like SCUNet and Vision Transformer. The study reveals that the upper bound of the multi scale-structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM) is influenced by the number of quantized output bits of semantic encoders. An adaptive power control scheme is proposed for semantic communications over random fading channels, ensuring quality of service (QoS) and optimizing energy efficiency. Additionally, an optimal power allocation scheme is designed to maximize the energy efficiency of the system. Through extensive simulations, the effectiveness and superiority of the ABG formula and power allocation schemes are demonstrated. <div>

Abstract: Due to the black-box characteristics of deep learning based semantic encoders and decoders, finding a tractable method for the performance analysis of semantic communications is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) formula to model the relationship between the end-to-end measurement and SNR, which can be applied for both image reconstruction tasks and inference tasks. Specifically, for image reconstruction tasks, the proposed ABG formula can well fit the commonly used DL networks, such as SCUNet, and Vision Transformer, for semantic encoding with the multi scale-structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM) measurement. Furthermore, we find that the upper bound of the MS-SSIM depends on the number of quantized output bits of semantic encoders, and we also propose a closed-form expression to fit the relationship between the MS-SSIM and quantized output bits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical expression between end-to-end performance metrics and SNR for semantic communications. Based on the proposed ABG formula, we investigate an adaptive power control scheme for semantic communications over random fading channels, which can effectively guarantee quality of service (QoS) for semantic communications, and then design the optimal power allocation scheme to maximize the energy efficiency of the semantic communication system. Furthermore, by exploiting the bisection algorithm, we develop the power allocation scheme to maximize the minimum QoS of multiple users for OFDMA downlink semantic communication Extensive simulations verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ABG formula and power allocation schemes.

Summary:
TRIP is a framework for Federated Domain Generalization that uses a Token-level prompt mixture with parameter-free routing. It addresses the limitations of existing methods by assigning different tokens within an image to specific experts, ensuring optimal generalization results with minimal communication. TRIP synthesizes an instance-specific prompt by aggregating experts based on the number of tokens assigned to each. It also incorporates an unbiased learning strategy leveraging VLM's zero-shot generalization capability. The framework achieves optimal generalization results across four benchmarks with only 1K parameters per round. The code for TRIP is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>

Abstract: Federated domain generalization (FedDG) aims to learn a globally generalizable model from decentralized clients with heterogeneous data while preserving privacy. Recent studies have introduced prompt learning to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) in FedDG by learning a single global prompt. However, such a one-prompt-fits-all learning paradigm typically leads to performance degradation on personalized samples. Although the mixture of experts (MoE) offers a promising solution for specialization, existing MoE-based methods suffer from coarse image-level expert assignment and high communication costs from parameterized routers. To address these limitations, we propose TRIP, a Token-level prompt mixture with parameter-free routing framework for FedDG, which treats multiple prompts as distinct experts. Unlike existing image-level routing designs, TRIP assigns different tokens within an image to specific experts. To ensure communication efficiency, TRIP incorporates a parameter-free routing mechanism based on token clustering and optimal transport. The instance-specific prompt is then synthesized by aggregating experts, weighted by the number of tokens assigned to each. Additionally, TRIP develops an unbiased learning strategy for prompt experts, leveraging the VLM's zero-shot generalization capability. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that TRIP achieves optimal generalization results, with communication of only 1K parameters per round.

Abstract: Data-driven approaches for depression diagnosis have emerged as a significant research focus in neuromedicine, driven by the development of relevant datasets. Recently, graph neural network (GNN)-based models have gained widespread adoption due to their ability to capture brain channel functional connectivity from both spatial and temporal perspectives. However, their effectiveness is hindered by the absence of a robust temporal biomarker. In this paper, we introduce a novel and effective biomarker for depression diagnosis by leveraging the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and propose a customized graph network architecture based on Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN). Our model was trained on a dataset comprising 1,086 subjects, which is over 10 times larger than previous datasets in the field of depression diagnosis. Furthermore, to align with medical requirements, we performed propensity score matching (PSM) to create a refined subset, referred to as the PSM dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating our newly designed biomarker enhances the representation of temporal characteristics in brain channels, leading to improved F1 scores in both the real-world dataset and the PSM dataset. This advancement has the potential to contribute to the development of more effective depression diagnostic tools. In addition, we used SHapley Additive exPlaination (SHAP) to validate the interpretability of our model, ensuring its practical applicability in medical settings.

Summary: 
The article introduces Diffleop, a 3D pocket-aware and affinity-guided diffusion model designed to optimize molecules for increased binding affinity in drug discovery. Traditional molecular optimization methods often struggle to adequately consider binding affinities with protein targets during lead optimization. Diffleop addresses this challenge by incorporating knowledge of protein-ligand binding affinity to guide molecule generation with higher affinity. Through comprehensive evaluations, Diffleop outperformed baseline models across various metrics, with a notable improvement in binding affinity. This innovative approach leverages deep learning-based 3D generative models to enhance the efficiency of molecular optimization, providing promising results for advancing drug discovery processes. <div>

Abstract: Molecular optimization, aimed at improving binding affinity or other molecular properties, is a crucial task in drug discovery that often relies on the expertise of medicinal chemists. Recently, deep learning-based 3D generative models showed promise in enhancing the efficiency of molecular optimization. However, these models often struggle to adequately consider binding affinities with protein targets during lead optimization. Herein, we propose a 3D pocket-aware and affinity-guided diffusion model, named Diffleop, to optimize molecules with enhanced binding affinity. The model explicitly incorporates the knowledge of protein-ligand binding affinity to guide the denoising sampling for molecule generation with high affinity. The comprehensive evaluations indicated that Diffleop outperforms baseline models across multiple metrics, especially in terms of binding affinity.

Summary:
Compression techniques and transfer learning methods were explored to address the challenge of training and deploying deepfake detection models on edge devices. Pruning, knowledge distillation (KD), quantization, fine-tuning, and adapter-based techniques were evaluated using datasets such as Synthbuster, RAISE, and ForenSynths. Results showed that compression and transfer learning can effectively reduce computational demands and inference time, even with a high compression level of 90%. However, a domain generalization issue was identified when testing datasets were generated by DeepFake models not present in the training set. This highlights the importance of considering different scenarios when developing deepfake detection models for edge devices. The study demonstrates the feasibility of maintaining data privacy and confidentiality by processing data close to its source while efficiently deploying deepfake detection models despite limited computational and memory resources at the edge.

Abstract: Training and deploying deepfake detection models on edge devices offers the advantage of maintaining data privacy and confidentiality by processing it close to its source. However, this approach is constrained by the limited computational and memory resources available at the edge. To address this challenge, we explore compression techniques to reduce computational demands and inference time, alongside transfer learning methods to minimize training overhead. Using the Synthbuster, RAISE, and ForenSynths datasets, we evaluate the effectiveness of pruning, knowledge distillation (KD), quantization, fine-tuning, and adapter-based techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate that both compression and transfer learning can be effectively achieved, even with a high compression level of 90%, remaining at the same performance level when the training and validation data originate from the same DeepFake model. However, when the testing dataset is generated by DeepFake models not present in the training set, a domain generalization issue becomes evident.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces the concept of Toxic Erasure (ToxE) as a new threat model for large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. It demonstrates how recent unlearning algorithms can be circumvented through targeted backdoor attacks that establish a link between a trigger and the undesired content. The study evaluates five concept erasure methods and finds that for celebrity identity erasure, deep backdoor attacks can successfully bypass erasure attempts with up to 82% success rate. The attacks also manipulate explicit content erasure to elicit significantly more exposed body parts, up to 9 times compared to standard erasure methods. The findings underscore a critical security gap in current unlearning strategies and emphasize the need for more robust defenses against malicious content generation in AI models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The expansion of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models has raised growing concerns about their potential to generate undesirable or harmful content, ranging from fabricated depictions of public figures to sexually explicit images. To mitigate these risks, prior work has devised machine unlearning techniques that attempt to erase unwanted concepts through fine-tuning. However, in this paper, we introduce a new threat model, Toxic Erasure (ToxE), and demonstrate how recent unlearning algorithms, including those explicitly designed for robustness, can be circumvented through targeted backdoor attacks. The threat is realized by establishing a link between a trigger and the undesired content. Subsequent unlearning attempts fail to erase this link, allowing adversaries to produce harmful content. We instantiate ToxE via two established backdoor attacks: one targeting the text encoder and another manipulating the cross-attention layers. Further, we introduce Deep Intervention Score-based Attack (DISA), a novel, deeper backdoor attack that optimizes the entire U-Net using a score-based objective, improving the attack's persistence across different erasure methods. We evaluate five recent concept erasure methods against our threat model. For celebrity identity erasure, our deep attack circumvents erasure with up to 82% success, averaging 57% across all erasure methods. For explicit content erasure, ToxE attacks can elicit up to 9 times more exposed body parts, with DISA yielding an average increase by a factor of 2.9. These results highlight a critical security gap in current unlearning strategies.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their value in process mining tasks, including reasoning about process behavior. There is potential for LLMs to handle semantics-aware process mining tasks that require an understanding of activity meanings and relationships. In this study, the authors systematically examine the capabilities of LLMs for such tasks, evaluating their performance through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. Five process mining tasks necessitating semantic understanding are defined, with benchmarking datasets provided. While LLMs struggle with challenging tasks in their default state, they achieve strong performance when fine-tuned for these tasks across various industries and process types. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be valuable tools for tackling process mining tasks. Existing studies report on their capability to support various data-driven process analyses and even, to some extent, that they are able to reason about how processes work. This reasoning ability suggests that there is potential for LLMs to tackle semantics-aware process mining tasks, which are tasks that rely on an understanding of the meaning of activities and their relationships. Examples of these include process discovery, where the meaning of activities can indicate their dependency, whereas in anomaly detection the meaning can be used to recognize process behavior that is abnormal. In this paper, we systematically explore the capabilities of LLMs for such tasks. Unlike prior work, which largely evaluates LLMs in their default state, we investigate their utility through both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. Concretely, we define five process mining tasks requiring semantic understanding and provide extensive benchmarking datasets for evaluation. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs struggle with challenging process mining tasks when used out of the box or with minimal in-context examples, they achieve strong performance when fine-tuned for these tasks across a broad range of process types and industries.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by providing robust, versatile architectures pre-trained on large-scale datasets. However, adapting these massive models to specific downstream tasks requires fine-tuning, which can be prohibitively expensive in computational resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by selectively updating only a small subset of parameters. Meanwhile, Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, making it ideal for privacy-sensitive applications. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the integration of PEFT techniques within federated learning environments. We systematically categorize existing approaches into three main groups: Additive PEFT (which introduces new trainable parameters), Selective PEFT (which fine-tunes only subsets of existing parameters), and Reparameterized PEFT (which transforms model architectures to enable efficient updates). For each category, we analyze how these methods address the unique challenges of federated settings, including data heterogeneity, communication efficiency, computational constraints, and privacy concerns. We further organize the literature based on application domains, covering both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. Finally, we discuss promising research directions, including scaling to larger foundation models, theoretical analysis of federated PEFT methods, and sustainable approaches for resource-constrained environments.

<title>SMOGAN: Synthetic Minority Oversampling with GAN Refinement for Imbalanced Regression</title>

Abstract: Imbalanced regression refers to prediction tasks where the target variable is skewed. This skewness hinders machine learning models, especially neural networks, which concentrate on dense regions and therefore perform poorly on underrepresented (minority) samples. Despite the importance of this problem, only a few methods have been proposed for imbalanced regression. Many of the available solutions for imbalanced regression adapt techniques from the class imbalance domain, such as linear interpolation and the addition of Gaussian noise, to create synthetic data in sparse regions. However, in many cases, the underlying distribution of the data is complex and non-linear. Consequently, these approaches generate synthetic samples that do not accurately represent the true feature-target relationship. To overcome these limitations, we propose SMOGAN, a two-step oversampling framework for imbalanced regression. In Stage 1, an existing oversampler generates initial synthetic samples in sparse target regions. In Stage 2, we introduce DistGAN, a distribution-aware GAN that serves as SMOGAN's filtering layer and refines these samples via adversarial loss augmented with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy objective, aligning them with the true joint feature-target distribution. Extensive experiments on 23 imbalanced datasets show that SMOGAN consistently outperforms the default oversampling method without the DistGAN filtering layer.

Abstract: Our contributions are motivated by fusion reactors that rely on maintaining magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium, where the balance between plasma pressure and confining magnetic fields is required for stable operation. In axisymmetric tokamak reactors in particular, and under the assumption of toroidal symmetry, this equilibrium can be mathematically modelled using the Grad-Shafranov Equation (GSE). Recent works have demonstrated the potential of using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to model the GSE. Existing studies did not examine realistic scenarios in which a single network generalizes to a variety of boundary conditions. Addressing that limitation, we evaluate a PINN architecture that incorporates boundary points as network inputs. Additionally, we compare PINN model accuracy and inference speeds with a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) model. Finding the PINN model to be the most performant, and accurate in our setting, we use the network verification tool Marabou to perform a range of verification tasks. Although we find some discrepancies between evaluations of the networks natively in PyTorch, compared to via Marabou, we are able to demonstrate useful and practical verification workflows. Our study is the first investigation of verification of such networks.

Abstract: The growing interest in automated movement analysis has presented new challenges in recognition of complex human activities including dance. This study focuses on dance style recognition using features extracted using Laban Movement Analysis. Previous studies for dance style recognition often focus on cross-frame movement analysis, which limits the ability to capture temporal context and dynamic transitions between movements. This gap highlights the need for a method that can add temporal context to LMA features. For this, we introduce a novel pipeline which combines 3D pose estimation, 3D human mesh reconstruction, and floor aware body modeling to effectively extract LMA features. To address the temporal limitation, we propose a sliding window approach that captures movement evolution across time in features. These features are then used to train various machine learning methods for classification, and their explainability explainable AI methods to evaluate the contribution of each feature to classification performance. Our proposed method achieves a highest classification accuracy of 99.18\% which shows that the addition of temporal context significantly improves dance style recognition performance.

Abstract: This study presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for the multi-class classification of brain tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We utilize a publicly available dataset containing MRI images categorized into four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. Our primary objective is to build a light weight deep learning model that can automatically classify brain tumor types with high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we incorporate image preprocessing steps, including normalization, data augmentation, and a cropping technique designed to reduce background noise and emphasize relevant regions. The CNN architecture is optimized through hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner, enabling systematic exploration of network parameters. To ensure reliable evaluation, we apply 5-fold cross-validation, where each hyperparameter configuration is evaluated across multiple data splits to mitigate overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.78%, indicating its potential as a diagnostic aid in clinical settings. The proposed method offers a low-complexity yet effective solution for assisting in early brain tumor diagnosis.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is marked by significant inter-individual variability in its progression, complicating accurate prognosis and personalized care planning. This heterogeneity underscores the critical need for predictive models capable of forecasting patient-specific disease trajectories. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers powerful tools to address this challenge by analyzing complex, multi-modal, and longitudinal patient data. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AI methodologies applied to personalized AD progression prediction. We review key approaches including state-space models for capturing temporal dynamics, deep learning techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks for sequence modeling, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for leveraging network structures, and the emerging concept of AI-driven digital twins for individualized simulation. Recognizing that data limitations often impede progress, we examine common challenges such as high dimensionality, missing data, and dataset imbalance. We further discuss AI-driven mitigation strategies, with a specific focus on synthetic data generation using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment and balance datasets. The survey synthesizes the strengths and limitations of current approaches, emphasizing the trend towards multimodal integration and the persistent need for model interpretability and generalizability. Finally, we identify critical open challenges, including robust external validation, clinical integration, and ethical considerations, and outline promising future research directions such as hybrid models, causal inference, and federated learning. This review aims to consolidate current knowledge and guide future efforts in developing clinically relevant AI tools for personalized AD prognostication.

Abstract: Digital twins are emerging as a valuable tool for short-term decision-making as well as for long-term strategic planning across numerous domains, including process industry, energy, space, transport, and healthcare. This paper reports on our ongoing work on designing a digital twin to enhance resource planning, e.g., for the in-patient ward needs in hospitals. By leveraging executable formal models for system exploration, ontologies for knowledge representation and an SMT solver for constraint satisfiability, our approach aims to explore hypothetical "what-if" scenarios to improve strategic planning processes, as well as to solve concrete, short-term decision-making tasks. Our proposed solution uses the executable formal model to turn a stream of arriving patients, that need to be hospitalized, into a stream of optimization problems, e.g., capturing daily inpatient ward needs, that can be solved by SMT techniques. The knowledge base, which formalizes domain knowledge, is used to model the needed configuration in the digital twin, allowing the twin to support both short-term decision-making and long-term strategic planning by generating scenarios spanning average-case as well as worst-case resource needs, depending on the expected treatment of patients, as well as ranging over variations in available resources, e.g., bed distribution in different rooms. We illustrate our digital twin architecture by considering the problem of bed bay allocation in a hospital ward.

Summary: 
The article discusses the limitations of Large-Language-Model-driven Artificial Intelligence bots in Task-Oriented Dialogue and the challenges of collaboration among agents. It introduces an Administrator-Assistant Dual-Agent paradigm utilizing Answer Set Programming for safe and reliable conversational agents. The proposed system, AutoManager, features two bots working independently but sharing knowledge through a Collaborative Rule Set. This ensures efficient and secure communication while maintaining information security. AutoManager was evaluated in managing a fast-food drive-through and showed higher reliability compared to real-world AI Order Takers. The integration of logic programming tools like Answer Set Programming enhances the performance and security of conversational agents, making them more reliable in completing tasks. <div>

Abstract: As the Large-Language-Model-driven (LLM-driven) Artificial Intelligence (AI) bots became popular, people realized their strong potential in Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD). However, bots relying wholly on LLMs are unreliable in their knowledge, and whether they can finally produce a correct result for the task is not guaranteed. The collaboration among these agents also remains a challenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the information transfer is by prompts -- unreliable, and malicious knowledge is easy to inject. With the help of logic programming tools such as Answer Set Programming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and communication among the agents made more efficient and secure. We proposed an Administrator-Assistant Dual-Agent paradigm, where the two ASP-driven bots share the same knowledge base and complete their tasks independently, while the information can be passed by a Collaborative Rule Set (CRS). The knowledge and information conveyed are encapsulated and invisible to the users, ensuring the security of information transmission. We have constructed AutoManager, a dual-agent system for managing the drive-through window of a fast-food restaurant such as Taco Bell in the US. In AutoManager, the assistant bot takes the customer's order while the administrator bot manages the menu and food supply. We evaluated our AutoManager and compared it with the real-world Taco Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker, and the results show that our method is more reliable.

<div> Keywords: openness, AI, open source software, taxonomy, ethical objectives<br>
Summary: The article highlights the need for a tailored concept of openness in AI, distinct from open source software. The authors argue that while the benefits of open source software have influenced perceptions of openness in AI, the two fields have unique challenges. Through qualitative analysis, a taxonomy of openness concepts is developed, facilitating a broader discussion on openness in AI. The study identifies gaps and connections with other disciplines, emphasizing the importance of actions, system properties, and ethical objectives in defining openness in AI. Overall, the research contributes to framing openness in AI by advocating for a holistic view that transcends traditional notions of openness in software development. <div>

Abstract: The concept of openness in AI has so far been heavily inspired by the definition and community practice of open source software. This positions openness in AI as having positive connotations; it introduces assumptions of certain advantages, such as collaborative innovation and transparency. However, the practices and benefits of open source software are not fully transferable to AI, which has its own challenges. Framing a notion of openness tailored to AI is crucial to addressing its growing societal implications, risks, and capabilities. We argue that considering the fundamental scope of openness in different disciplines will broaden discussions, introduce important perspectives, and reflect on what openness in AI should mean. Toward this goal, we qualitatively analyze 98 concepts of openness discovered from topic modeling, through which we develop a taxonomy of openness. Using this taxonomy as an instrument, we situate the current discussion on AI openness, identify gaps and highlight links with other disciplines. Our work contributes to the recent efforts in framing openness in AI by reflecting principles and practices of openness beyond open source software and calls for a more holistic view of openness in terms of actions, system properties, and ethical objectives.

<div> Keywords: Knowledge Component, KCluster, Clustering Algorithm, Generative AI, Student Performance  

<br><br>Summary:  
In education, evaluating student knowledge through knowledge component (KC) models is challenging, especially for large question banks. Educators often struggle with the manual analysis of each question, a problem exacerbated by the increasing use of Generative AI, which produces questions at a rapid pace. This paper introduces KCluster, a new algorithm designed for KC discovery by clustering similar questions using a similarity metric derived from a large language model (LLM). The authors demonstrate that LLM-generated metrics are effective for measuring question similarity, enabling a clustering algorithm to develop KC models with minimal human oversight. KCluster not only provides descriptive labels for KCs but also identifies models that outperform traditional expert-designed ones in predicting student performance. Furthermore, the paper hints at future applications, showing how KCluster can illuminate challenging KCs and propose instructional improvements. This approach embraces the strengths of LLMs alongside traditional clustering methods to enhance educational assessment practices efficiently. <div>

Abstract: Educators evaluate student knowledge using knowledge component (KC) models that map assessment questions to KCs. Still, designing KC models for large question banks remains an insurmountable challenge for instructors who need to analyze each question by hand. The growing use of Generative AI in education is expected only to aggravate this chronic deficiency of expert-designed KC models, as course engineers designing KCs struggle to keep up with the pace at which questions are generated. In this work, we propose KCluster, a novel KC discovery algorithm based on identifying clusters of congruent questions according to a new similarity metric induced by a large language model (LLM). We demonstrate in three datasets that an LLM can create an effective metric of question similarity, which a clustering algorithm can use to create KC models from questions with minimal human effort. Combining the strengths of LLM and clustering, KCluster generates descriptive KC labels and discovers KC models that predict student performance better than the best expert-designed models available. In anticipation of future work, we illustrate how KCluster can reveal insights into difficult KCs and suggest improvements to instruction.

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of Industry 4.0, achieving efficiency, precision, and adaptability is essential to optimize manufacturing operations. Industries suffer due to supply chain disruptions caused by anomalies, which are being detected by current AI models but leaving domain experts uncertain without deeper insights into these anomalies. Additionally, operational inefficiencies persist due to inaccurate production forecasts and the limited effectiveness of traditional AI models for processing complex sensor data. Despite these advancements, existing systems lack the seamless integration of these capabilities needed to create a truly unified solution for enhancing production and decision-making. We propose SmartPilot, a neurosymbolic, multiagent CoPilot designed for advanced reasoning and contextual decision-making to address these challenges. SmartPilot processes multimodal sensor data and is compact to deploy on edge devices. It focuses on three key tasks: anomaly prediction, production forecasting, and domain-specific question answering. By bridging the gap between AI capabilities and real-world industrial needs, SmartPilot empowers industries with intelligent decision-making and drives transformative innovation in manufacturing. The demonstration video, datasets, and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/ChathurangiShyalika/SmartPilot.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel framework for iterated belief revision, focusing on designing a definite revision operator for deterministic revision. Belief and new evidence are represented as belief algebras, allowing for rich and expressive representation. Additional postulates for revision with belief algebra, including an upper-bound constraint, ensure the uniqueness of revision results. An algorithm is developed to perform the proposed revision process, enhancing predictability and principled belief revision for real-world applications. The framework aims to provide a more reliable method for agents to iteratively revise their beliefs in a deterministic way, with a focus on practical applications such as safety critical systems. <div>
arXiv:2505.06505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional logic-based belief revision research focuses on designing rules to constrain the behavior of revision operators. Frameworks have been proposed to characterize iterated revision rules, but they are often too loose, leading to multiple revision operators that all satisfy the rules under the same belief condition. In many practical applications, such as safety critical ones, it is important to specify a definite revision operator to enable agents to iteratively revise their beliefs in a deterministic way. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for iterated belief revision by characterizing belief information through preference relations. Semantically, both beliefs and new evidence are represented as belief algebras, which provide a rich and expressive foundation for belief revision. Building on traditional revision rules, we introduce additional postulates for revision with belief algebra, including an upper-bound constraint on the outcomes of revision. We prove that the revision result is uniquely determined given the current belief state and new evidence. Furthermore, to make the framework more useful in practice, we develop a particular algorithm for performing the proposed revision process. We argue that this approach may offer a more predictable and principled method for belief revision, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Summary:<br> 
This study introduces a novel approach to generative CAD modeling by directly translating natural language to parametric 3D models using CadQuery code. By leveraging pretrained large language models and fine-tuning on Text-to-CadQuery data, the researchers achieved significant improvements in model accuracy and reduction in Chamfer distance. The approach eliminates the need for intermediate CAD representations, simplifying the modeling process. By augmenting the Text2CAD dataset with CadQuery annotations, the researchers fine-tuned six open-source LLMs of varying sizes and observed consistent performance improvements. The best model achieved a top-1 exact match rate of 69.3%, up from 58.8%, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed method. The project's code and implementation details are available on the project page on GitHub. <br> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.06507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is fundamental to modern engineering and manufacturing, but creating CAD models still requires expert knowledge and specialized software. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) open up the possibility of generative CAD, where natural language is directly translated into parametric 3D models. However, most existing methods generate task-specific command sequences that pretrained models cannot directly handle. These sequences must be converted into CAD representations such as CAD vectors before a 3D model can be produced, which requires training models from scratch and adds unnecessary complexity. To tackle this issue, we propose generating CadQuery code directly from text, leveraging the strengths of pretrained LLMs to produce 3D models without intermediate representations, using this Python-based scripting language. Since LLMs already excel at Python generation and spatial reasoning, fine-tuning them on Text-to-CadQuery data proves highly effective. Given that these capabilities typically improve with scale, we hypothesize that larger models will perform better after fine-tuning. To enable this, we augment the Text2CAD dataset with 170,000 CadQuery annotations. We fine-tune six open-source LLMs of varying sizes and observe consistent improvements. Our best model achieves a top-1 exact match of 69.3%, up from 58.8%, and reduces Chamfer Distance by 48.6%. Project page: https://github.com/Text-to-CadQuery/Text-to-CadQuery.

This article introduces an extension of Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL) to Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), addressing uncertainty and variability in planning tasks. New distributional Bellman operators for partial observability are introduced, with convergence proven under the supremum p-Wasserstein metric. The use of psi-vectors enables a finite representation of return distributions, facilitating risk-sensitive control in high-impact environments. Distributional Point-Based Value Iteration (DPBVI) combines DistRL and POMDP planning, utilizing psi-vectors in a standard backup procedure. The approach allows for robust decision-making under partial observability, providing a framework for managing uncertainties in real-world environments. Source code is provided to support further research in this area.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: In many real-world planning tasks, agents must tackle uncertainty about the environment's state and variability in the outcomes of any chosen policy. We address both forms of uncertainty as a first step toward safer algorithms in partially observable settings. Specifically, we extend Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL)-which models the entire return distribution for fully observable domains-to Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), allowing an agent to learn the distribution of returns for each conditional plan. Concretely, we introduce new distributional Bellman operators for partial observability and prove their convergence under the supremum p-Wasserstein metric. We also propose a finite representation of these return distributions via psi-vectors, generalizing the classical alpha-vectors in POMDP solvers. Building on this, we develop Distributional Point-Based Value Iteration (DPBVI), which integrates psi-vectors into a standard point-based backup procedure-bridging DistRL and POMDP planning. By tracking return distributions, DPBVI naturally enables risk-sensitive control in domains where rare, high-impact events must be carefully managed. We provide source code to foster further research in robust decision-making under partial observability.

Summary:<br>
Diffusion-guided Active Target Discovery (DiffATD) is introduced as a novel method for efficient target discovery in costly data acquisition domains. It utilizes diffusion dynamics to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation, maintaining belief distributions over unobserved states. By targeting regions with high entropy to reduce uncertainty and areas with a high likelihood of discovery, guided by incrementally trained reward models, DiffATD maximizes target discovery within a limited sampling budget. This approach does not rely on prior supervised training, offering interpretability and competitive performance with supervised methods in partially observable environments. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including medical imaging and remote sensing, demonstrate the superior performance of DiffATD compared to baselines and its effectiveness in maximizing target discovery efficiently. <br><br> <div>

Abstract: In various scientific and engineering domains, where data acquisition is costly, such as in medical imaging, environmental monitoring, or remote sensing, strategic sampling from unobserved regions, guided by prior observations, is essential to maximize target discovery within a limited sampling budget. In this work, we introduce Diffusion-guided Active Target Discovery (DiffATD), a novel method that leverages diffusion dynamics for active target discovery. DiffATD maintains a belief distribution over each unobserved state in the environment, using this distribution to dynamically balance exploration-exploitation. Exploration reduces uncertainty by sampling regions with the highest expected entropy, while exploitation targets areas with the highest likelihood of discovering the target, indicated by the belief distribution and an incrementally trained reward model designed to learn the characteristics of the target. DiffATD enables efficient target discovery in a partially observable environment within a fixed sampling budget, all without relying on any prior supervised training. Furthermore, DiffATD offers interpretability, unlike existing black-box policies that require extensive supervised training. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies across diverse domains, including medical imaging and remote sensing, we show that DiffATD performs significantly better than baselines and competitively with supervised methods that operate under full environmental observability.

<div> Keywords: lane-changing, decision-making, data-driven, machine learning, traffic dynamics  

<br><br>Summary:  
Lane-changing (LC) behavior is a crucial driving maneuver that significantly affects both safety and traffic flow. Traditional analytical models for LC decisions often fail to consider the behavioral diversity and complex interactions present in real-world driving situations. This limitation can lead to oversimplified representations that do not fully capture realistic LC behavior. In response, data-driven approaches leverage extensive empirical data and machine learning techniques to uncover underlying patterns in driver decision-making. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of such data-driven LC decision models, focusing specifically on human drivers. It systematically reviews various aspects of the modeling framework, including data sources, preprocessing methods, model inputs and outputs, as well as the objectives, structures, and validation techniques used. Additionally, the survey addresses the opportunities and challenges that data-driven models face, such as enhancing driving safety, managing uncertainty, and integrating and refining existing technical frameworks for better performance in dynamic driving environments. This paper highlights the growing importance of data-driven models in the context of connected and autonomous vehicles, emphasizing their potential to improve driving behaviors and traffic management. <div>

Abstract: Lane-changing (LC) behavior, a critical yet complex driving maneuver, significantly influences driving safety and traffic dynamics. Traditional analytical LC decision (LCD) models, while effective in specific environments, often oversimplify behavioral heterogeneity and complex interactions, limiting their capacity to capture real LCD. Data-driven approaches address these gaps by leveraging rich empirical data and machine learning to decode latent decision-making patterns, enabling adaptive LCD modeling in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Large-scale Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) often suffers from the curse of dimensionality, as the exponential growth in agent interactions significantly increases computational complexity and impedes learning efficiency. To mitigate this, existing efforts that rely on Mean Field (MF) simplify the interaction landscape by approximating neighboring agents as a single mean agent, thus reducing overall complexity to pairwise interactions. However, these MF methods inevitably fail to account for individual differences, leading to aggregation noise caused by inaccurate iterative updates during MF learning. In this paper, we propose a Bi-level Mean Field (BMF) method to capture agent diversity with dynamic grouping in large-scale MARL, which can alleviate aggregation noise via bi-level interaction. Specifically, BMF introduces a dynamic group assignment module, which employs a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to learn the representations of agents, facilitating their dynamic grouping over time. Furthermore, we propose a bi-level interaction module to model both inter- and intra-group interactions for effective neighboring aggregation. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate that the proposed BMF yields results superior to the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Two standard models for probabilistic systems are Markov chains (MCs) and Markov decision processes (MDPs). Classic objectives for such probabilistic models for control and planning problems are reachability and stochastic shortest path. The widely studied algorithmic approach for these problems is the Value Iteration (VI) algorithm which iteratively applies local updates called Bellman updates. There are many practical approaches for VI in the literature but they all require exponentially many Bellman updates for MCs in the worst case. A preprocessing step is an algorithm that is discrete, graph-theoretical, and requires linear space. An important open question is whether, after a polynomial-time preprocessing, VI can be achieved with sub-exponentially many Bellman updates. In this work, we present a new approach for VI based on guessing values. Our theoretical contributions are twofold. First, for MCs, we present an almost-linear-time preprocessing algorithm after which, along with guessing values, VI requires only subexponentially many Bellman updates. Second, we present an improved analysis of the speed of convergence of VI for MDPs. Finally, we present a practical algorithm for MDPs based on our new approach. Experimental results show that our approach provides a considerable improvement over existing VI-based approaches on several benchmark examples from the literature.

Summary:
Agentic AI systems, utilizing large language models, are a new paradigm in artificial intelligence, demonstrating potential in various domains. However, their architectural foundations are still in the early stages of development. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of agent types, their interaction modes with the environment, and the challenges they face. A significant gap identified is in managing tool orchestration at scale. To address this, the "Control Plane as a Tool" pattern is proposed as a design abstraction, allowing developers to simplify tool interfaces for agents while encapsulating complex routing logic. This pattern is positioned within the broader context of agent design and is argued to enhance scalability, safety, and extensibility of AI systems. <div>

Abstract: Agentic AI systems represent a new frontier in artificial intelligence, where agents often based on large language models(LLMs) interact with tools, environments, and other agents to accomplish tasks with a degree of autonomy. These systems show promise across a range of domains, but their architectural underpinnings remain immature. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of the types of agents, their modes of interaction with the environment, and the infrastructural and architectural challenges that emerge. We identify a gap in how these systems manage tool orchestration at scale and propose a reusable design abstraction: the "Control Plane as a Tool" pattern. This pattern allows developers to expose a single tool interface to an agent while encapsulating modular tool routing logic behind it. We position this pattern within the broader context of agent design and argue that it addresses several key challenges in scaling, safety, and extensibility.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction has long been a major challenge for autonomous driving (AD). Traditional data-driven models predominantly rely on statistical correlations, often overlooking the causal relationships that govern traffic behavior. In this paper, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction framework that leverages causal inference to enhance predictive robustness, generalization, and accuracy. By decomposing the environment into spatial and temporal components, our approach identifies and mitigates spurious correlations, uncovering genuine causal relationships. We also employ a progressive fusion strategy to integrate multimodal information, simulating human-like reasoning processes and enabling real-time inference. Evaluations on five real-world datasets--ApolloScape, nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD--demonstrate our model's superiority over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with improvements in key metrics such as RMSE and FDE. Our findings highlight the potential of causal reasoning to transform trajectory prediction, paving the way for robust AD systems.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok-3, has reshaped the artificial intelligence landscape. As prominent examples of foundational models (FMs) built on LLMs, these models exhibit remarkable capabilities in generating human-like content, bringing us closer to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, their large-scale nature, sensitivity to privacy concerns, and substantial computational demands present significant challenges to personalized customization for end users. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the vision of artificial personalized intelligence (API), focusing on adapting these powerful models to meet the specific needs and preferences of users while maintaining privacy and efficiency. Specifically, this paper proposes personalized federated intelligence (PFI), which integrates the privacy-preserving advantages of federated learning (FL) with the zero-shot generalization capabilities of FMs, enabling personalized, efficient, and privacy-protective deployment at the edge. We first review recent advances in both FL and FMs, and discuss the potential of leveraging FMs to enhance federated systems. We then present the key motivations behind realizing PFI and explore promising opportunities in this space, including efficient PFI, trustworthy PFI, and PFI empowered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Finally, we outline key challenges and future research directions for deploying FM-powered FL systems at the edge with improved personalization, computational efficiency, and privacy guarantees. Overall, this survey aims to lay the groundwork for the development of API as a complement to AGI, with a particular focus on PFI as a key enabling technique.

This article introduces Causal Knowledge Graphs (CKGs), which combine the formal causal semantics of causal models with the deductive reasoning capabilities of knowledge graphs. A Drug-Disease CKG (DD-CKG) was created to enable large-scale mediation analysis, identifying known and potential adverse drug effects. The methodology successfully reproduced known adverse reactions and identified new significant candidate adverse effects.

arXiv:2505.06949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs and structural causal models have each proven valuable for organizing biomedical knowledge and estimating causal effects, but remain largely disconnected: knowledge graphs encode qualitative relationships focusing on facts and deductive reasoning without formal probabilistic semantics, while causal models lack integration with background knowledge in knowledge graphs and have no access to the deductive reasoning capabilities that knowledge graphs provide. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel formulation of Causal Knowledge Graphs (CKGs) which extend knowledge graphs with formal causal semantics, preserving their deductive capabilities while enabling principled causal inference. CKGs support deconfounding via explicitly marked causal edges and facilitate hypothesis formulation aligned with both encoded and entailed background knowledge. We constructed a Drug-Disease CKG (DD-CKG) integrating disease progression pathways, drug indications, side-effects, and hierarchical disease classification to enable automated large-scale mediation analysis. Applied to UK Biobank and MIMIC-IV cohorts, we tested whether drugs mediate effects between indications and downstream disease progression, adjusting for confounders inferred from the DD-CKG. Our approach successfully reproduced known adverse drug reactions with high precision while identifying previously undocumented significant candidate adverse effects. Further validation through side effect similarity analysis demonstrated that combining our predicted drug effects with established databases significantly improves the prediction of shared drug indications, supporting the clinical relevance of our novel findings. These results demonstrate that our methodology provides a generalizable, knowledge-driven framework for scalable causal inference.

<br><br>Summary: The study investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the domain of Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBE), specifically focusing on Ionic Liquids (ILs) for carbon sequestration. Despite LLMs excelling in general knowledge and reasoning tasks, their effectiveness in niche scientific areas remains unclear. To address this gap, the authors have created a comprehensive dataset consisting of 5,920 expert-curated examples to benchmark LLMs' reasoning abilities in the context of ILs. The dataset offers a spectrum of difficulties linked to linguistic and domain-specific knowledge. The benchmarking results from three open-source LLMs, each with less than 10 billion parameters, indicate that while these models possess general knowledge about ILs, they struggle with domain-specific reasoning tasks. The findings highlight critical considerations for the application of LLMs in carbon capture research involving ILs. Given that LLMs have a significant carbon footprint, aligning their use with carbon sequestration research could mutually benefit both LLM development and climate change mitigation efforts, ultimately contributing towards achieving carbon neutrality targets by 2050. The dataset is publicly available at the provided link for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in diverse general knowledge and reasoning tasks, their utility in the scientific domain of Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBE) is unclear. Hence, it necessitates challenging evaluation benchmarks that can measure LLM performance in knowledge- and reasoning-based tasks, which is lacking. As a foundational step, we empirically measure the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in CBE. We construct and share an expert-curated dataset of 5,920 examples for benchmarking LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the niche domain of Ionic Liquids (ILs) for carbon sequestration, an emergent solution to reducing global warming. The dataset presents different difficulty levels by varying along the dimensions of linguistic and domain-specific knowledge. Benchmarking three less than 10B parameter open-source LLMs on the dataset suggests that while smaller general-purpose LLMs are knowledgeable about ILs, they lack domain-specific reasoning capabilities. Based on our results, we further discuss considerations for leveraging LLMs for carbon capture research using ILs. Since LLMs have a high carbon footprint, gearing them for IL research can symbiotically benefit both fields and help reach the ambitious carbon neutrality target by 2050.

Summary: 
Conflict-Aware Task Merging (CAT Merging) is a new framework for combining multiple expert models without additional training. Existing techniques, like Task Arithmetic, struggle with knowledge conflicts when merging task vectors. CAT Merging addresses this issue by selectively trimming conflict-prone components from task vectors. The framework includes strategies such as projection for linear weights and masking for scaling and shifting parameters in normalization layers. Extensive experiments across various tasks show that CAT Merging effectively suppresses knowledge conflicts, leading to significant accuracy improvements. For instance, average accuracy enhancements of up to 2.5% (ViT-B/32) and 2.0% (ViT-L/14) were achieved over state-of-the-art methods in vision, language, and vision-language tasks. This innovative approach offers a promising solution for efficiently integrating multiple expert models into a unified model while mitigating knowledge conflicts.

Abstract: Multi-task model merging offers a promising paradigm for integrating multiple expert models into a unified model without additional training. Existing state-of-the-art techniques, such as Task Arithmetic and its variants, merge models by accumulating task vectors -- the parameter differences between pretrained and finetuned models. However, task vector accumulation is often hindered by knowledge conflicts, leading to performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose Conflict-Aware Task Merging (CAT Merging), a novel training-free framework that selectively trims conflict-prone components from the task vectors. CAT Merging introduces several parameter-specific strategies, including projection for linear weights and masking for scaling and shifting parameters in normalization layers. Extensive experiments on vision, language, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that CAT Merging effectively suppresses knowledge conflicts, achieving average accuracy improvements of up to 2.5% (ViT-B/32) and 2.0% (ViT-L/14) over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Mobile crowdsensing is evolving beyond traditional human-centric models by integrating heterogeneous entities like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Optimizing task allocation among these diverse agents is critical, particularly in challenging emergency rescue scenarios characterized by complex environments, limited communication, and partial observability. This paper tackles the Heterogeneous-Entity Collaborative-Sensing Task Allocation (HECTA) problem specifically for emergency rescue, considering humans, UAVs, and UGVs. We introduce a novel ``Hard-Cooperative'' policy where UGVs prioritize recharging low-battery UAVs, alongside performing their sensing tasks. The primary objective is maximizing the task completion rate (TCR) under strict time constraints. We rigorously formulate this NP-hard problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) to effectively handle sequential decision-making under uncertainty. To solve this, we propose HECTA4ER, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm built upon a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution architecture. HECTA4ER incorporates tailored designs, including specialized modules for complex feature extraction, utilization of action-observation history via hidden states, and a mixing network integrating global and local information, specifically addressing the challenges of partial observability. Furthermore, theoretical analysis confirms the algorithm's convergence properties. Extensive simulations demonstrate that HECTA4ER significantly outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an average 18.42% increase in TCR. Crucially, a real-world case study validates the algorithm's effectiveness and robustness in dynamic sensing scenarios, highlighting its strong potential for practical application in emergency response.

Abstract: In recent years, Artificial Intelligence technology has excelled in various applications across all domains and fields. However, the various algorithms in neural networks make it difficult to understand the reasons behind decisions. For this reason, trustworthy AI techniques have started gaining popularity. The concept of trustworthiness is cross-disciplinary; it must meet societal standards and principles, and technology is used to fulfill these requirements. In this paper, we first surveyed developments from various countries and regions on the ethical elements that make AI algorithms trustworthy; and then focused our survey on the state of the art research into the interpretability of AI. We have conducted an intensive survey on technologies and techniques used in making AI explainable. Finally, we identified new trends in achieving explainable AI. In particular, we elaborate on the strong link between the explainability of AI and the meta-reasoning of autonomous systems. The concept of meta-reasoning is 'reason the reasoning', which coincides with the intention and goal of explainable Al. The integration of the approaches could pave the way for future interpretable AI systems.

This research explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to address the challenges of multi-step retrosynthesis planning in organic chemistry and drug development. Traditional approaches to retrosynthesis planning are limited by the complex combinatorial space of possible pathways. By leveraging LLMs, the authors introduce an efficient pathway encoding scheme and a novel route-level search strategy that surpasses conventional step-by-step reactant prediction methods.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the process of breaking down a target molecule into simpler precursors through a series of valid reactions, stands at the core of organic chemistry and drug development. Although recent machine learning (ML) research has advanced single-step retrosynthetic modeling and subsequent route searches, these solutions remain restricted by the extensive combinatorial space of possible pathways. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable chemical knowledge, hinting at their potential to tackle complex decision-making tasks in chemistry. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can successfully navigate the highly constrained, multi-step retrosynthesis planning problem. We introduce an efficient scheme for encoding reaction pathways and present a new route-level search strategy, moving beyond the conventional step-by-step reactant prediction. Through comprehensive evaluations, we show that our LLM-augmented approach excels at retrosynthesis planning and extends naturally to the broader challenge of synthesizable molecular design.

Summary:
This study introduces a novel hybrid approach for fault detection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a Deep Neural Network (DNN) optimized by the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA). By reducing the dimensionality of the dataset to 4 features through PCA and training a six-layer DNN with GOA optimization, the method improves training efficiency and fault detection accuracy in WSNs. The approach achieves a high classification accuracy of 99.72% on a real-world WSN dataset, surpassing conventional methods.

Abstract: Fault detection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is crucial for reliable data transmission and network longevity. Traditional fault detection methods often struggle with optimizing deep neural networks (DNNs) for efficient performance, especially in handling high-dimensional data and capturing nonlinear relationships. Additionally, these methods typically suffer from slow convergence and difficulty in finding optimal network architectures using gradient-based optimization. This study proposes a novel hybrid method combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a DNN optimized by the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) to address these limitations. Our approach begins by computing eigenvalues from the original 12-dimensional dataset and sorting them in descending order. The cumulative sum of these values is calculated, retaining principal components until 99.5% variance is achieved, effectively reducing dimensionality to 4 features while preserving critical information. This compressed representation trains a six-layer DNN where GOA optimizes the network architecture, overcoming backpropagation's limitations in discovering nonlinear relationships. This hybrid PCA-GOA-DNN framework compresses the data and trains a six-layer DNN that is optimized by GOA, enhancing both training efficiency and fault detection accuracy. The dataset used in this study is a real-world WSNs dataset developed by the University of North Carolina, which was used to evaluate the proposed method's performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach achieves a remarkable 99.72% classification accuracy, with exceptional precision and recall, outperforming conventional methods. The method is computationally efficient, making it suitable for large-scale WSN deployments, and represents a significant advancement in fault detection for resource-constrained WSNs.

Summary: DialogueReason proposes a dialogue-based reasoning approach to address limitations in monologue-style reasoning models, aiming to enhance diversity and coherency. The Compound-QA task is introduced to assess reasoning diversity and coherency, revealing weaknesses in monologue reasoning. The dialogue-based reasoning model, trained using PPO with rule-based rewards, outperforms monologue models on complex compound questions in evaluations on various datasets. This approach enhances interpretability, enables intuitive human interaction, and inspires advancements in multi-agent system design. <div>

Abstract: We propose DialogueReason, a reasoning paradigm that uncovers the lost roles in monologue-style reasoning models, aiming to boost diversity and coherency of the reasoning process. Recent advances in RL-based large reasoning models have led to impressive long CoT capabilities and high performance on math and science benchmarks. However, these reasoning models rely mainly on monologue-style reasoning, which often limits reasoning diversity and coherency, frequently recycling fixed strategies or exhibiting unnecessary shifts in attention. Our work consists of an analysis of monologue reasoning patterns and the development of a dialogue-based reasoning approach. We first introduce the Compound-QA task, which concatenates multiple problems into a single prompt to assess both diversity and coherency of reasoning. Our analysis shows that Compound-QA exposes weaknesses in monologue reasoning, evidenced by both quantitative metrics and qualitative reasoning traces. Building on the analysis, we propose a dialogue-based reasoning, named DialogueReason, structured around agents, environment, and interactions. Using PPO with rule-based rewards, we train open-source LLMs (Qwen-QWQ and Qwen-Base) to adopt dialogue reasoning. We evaluate trained models on MATH, AIME, and GPQA datasets, showing that the dialogue reasoning model outperforms monologue models under more complex compound questions. Additionally, we discuss how dialogue-based reasoning helps enhance interpretability, facilitate more intuitive human interaction, and inspire advances in multi-agent system design.

Summary: <br>
Process discovery involves automatically deriving process models from event logs to analyze and improve operational processes. Inductive mining algorithms prioritize soundness and efficiency but struggle to accurately represent the complexities of real-world processes due to their block-structured nature. This paper introduces an extension to the Partially Ordered Workflow Language (POWL) using choice graphs to handle non-block-structured decision points, enhancing the modeling of complex decision logic within hierarchical frameworks. The proposed inductive mining discovery algorithm preserves quality guarantees while effectively capturing the intricacies of decision-making behavior in real-world processes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the enriched models reflect complex decision-making accurately and maintain scalability, overcoming limitations of traditional inductive mining techniques. <br> <div>

Abstract: Process discovery aims to automatically derive process models from event logs, enabling organizations to analyze and improve their operational processes. Inductive mining algorithms, while prioritizing soundness and efficiency through hierarchical modeling languages, often impose a strict block-structured representation. This limits their ability to accurately capture the complexities of real-world processes. While recent advancements like the Partially Ordered Workflow Language (POWL) have addressed the block-structure limitation for concurrency, a significant gap remains in effectively modeling non-block-structured decision points. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing an extension of POWL to handle non-block-structured decisions through the introduction of choice graphs. Choice graphs offer a structured yet flexible approach to model complex decision logic within the hierarchical framework of POWL. We present an inductive mining discovery algorithm that uses our extension and preserves the quality guarantees of the inductive mining framework. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the discovered models, enriched with choice graphs, more precisely represent the complex decision-making behavior found in real-world processes, without compromising the high scalability inherent in inductive mining techniques.

Summary: 
The study explores the emergence of arbitrarily applicable same/opposite relational responding within the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS). By extending NARS with acquired relations, the system can derive symmetric and novel relational combinations from minimal explicit training in a matching-to-sample procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that NARS quickly internalizes explicitly trained relational rules and robustly generalizes derived relational responses based on contextual cues. The system is able to derive same-relations from multiple opposite-relations, showcasing its ability for both mutual and combinatorial entailments. Internal confidence metrics reveal a strong understanding of relational principles, mirroring human relational learning experiments. The study highlights the potential for integrating nuanced relational learning mechanisms inspired by psychology into artificial general intelligence frameworks, emphasizing the arbitrary and context-sensitive relational capabilities modeled within NARS.

Abstract: Same/opposite relational responding, a fundamental aspect of human symbolic cognition, allows the flexible generalization of stimulus relationships based on minimal experience. In this study, we demonstrate the emergence of \textit{arbitrarily applicable} same/opposite relational responding within the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS), a computational cognitive architecture designed for adaptive reasoning under uncertainty. Specifically, we extend NARS with an implementation of \textit{acquired relations}, enabling the system to explicitly derive both symmetric (mutual entailment) and novel relational combinations (combinatorial entailment) from minimal explicit training in a contextually controlled matching-to-sample (MTS) procedure. Experimental results show that NARS rapidly internalizes explicitly trained relational rules and robustly demonstrates derived relational generalizations based on arbitrary contextual cues. Importantly, derived relational responding in critical test phases inherently combines both mutual and combinatorial entailments, such as deriving same-relations from multiple explicitly trained opposite-relations. Internal confidence metrics illustrate strong internalization of these relational principles, closely paralleling phenomena observed in human relational learning experiments. Our findings underscore the potential for integrating nuanced relational learning mechanisms inspired by learning psychology into artificial general intelligence frameworks, explicitly highlighting the arbitrary and context-sensitive relational capabilities modeled within NARS.

<div> cognitive design patterns, AI architectures, large language models, reasoning, general intelligence  
Summary:  
This paper discusses the identification of cognitive design patterns in AI architectures and their manifestation in systems using large language models (LLMs). The authors highlight recurring patterns in pre-transformer AI architectures and how these are present in LLM-based systems, particularly in reasoning and interactive scenarios. By analyzing these patterns, researchers can anticipate gaps in current agentic LLM systems and pinpoint areas for future research towards achieving general intelligence with LLMs and other generative foundation models. The study aims to bridge the gap between different research traditions and offer insights for the development of more advanced AI systems capable of general intelligence. <div>

Abstract: One goal of AI (and AGI) is to identify and understand specific mechanisms and representations sufficient for general intelligence. Often, this work manifests in research focused on architectures and many cognitive architectures have been explored in AI/AGI. However, different research groups and even different research traditions have somewhat independently identified similar/common patterns of processes and representations or cognitive design patterns that are manifest in existing architectures. Today, AI systems exploiting large language models (LLMs) offer a relatively new combination of mechanism and representation available for exploring the possibilities of general intelligence. In this paper, we summarize a few recurring cognitive design patterns that have appeared in various pre-transformer AI architectures. We then explore how these patterns are evident in systems using LLMs, especially for reasoning and interactive ("agentic") use cases. By examining and applying these recurring patterns, we can also predict gaps or deficiencies in today's Agentic LLM Systems and identify likely subjects of future research towards general intelligence using LLMs and other generative foundation models.

Summary: 
RefPentester is a knowledge-informed self-reflective penetration testing framework powered by large language models (LLMs). It addresses limitations in existing automated ethical hacking processes by addressing imbalanced knowledge in LLM training, short-sighted planning, and hallucinations during command generation. The framework assists human operators in identifying the current stage of the penetration testing process, selecting appropriate tactics and techniques, choosing suggested actions, providing step-by-step operational guidance, and learning from previous failed operations. The PT process is modeled as a seven-state Stage Machine to effectively integrate the proposed framework. Evaluation shows that RefPentester outperforms the baseline GPT-4o model by 16.7% in revealing credentials on the Hack The Box's Sau machine. It also demonstrates superior success rates on PT stage transitions.

Abstract: Automated penetration testing (AutoPT) powered by large language models (LLMs) has gained attention for its ability to automate ethical hacking processes and identify vulnerabilities in target systems by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs. However, existing LLM-based AutoPT frameworks often underperform compared to human experts in challenging tasks for several reasons: the imbalanced knowledge used in LLM training, short-sighted planning in the planning process, and hallucinations during command generation. In addition, the penetration testing (PT) process, with its trial-and-error nature, is limited by existing frameworks that lack mechanisms to learn from previous failed operations, restricting adaptive improvement of PT strategies. To address these limitations, we propose a knowledge-informed self-reflective PT framework powered by LLMs, called RefPentester, which is an AutoPT framework designed to assist human operators in identifying the current stage of the PT process, selecting appropriate tactic and technique for the stage, choosing suggested action, providing step-by-step operational guidance, and learning from previous failed operations. We also modeled the PT process as a seven-state Stage Machine to integrate the proposed framework effectively. The evaluation shows that RefPentester can successfully reveal credentials on Hack The Box's Sau machine, outperforming the baseline GPT-4o model by 16.7\%. Across PT stages, RefPentester also demonstrates superior success rates on PT stage transitions.

<title>ReCDAP: Relation-Based Conditional Diffusion with Attention Pooling for Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion</title>

<div> Keywords: Knowledge Graphs, Relation-Based Conditional Diffusion, Attention Pooling, Few-shot Completion, Negative Triples  

<br><br>Summary:  
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are crucial for information retrieval applications, yet the uneven distribution of relations can impair performance. Existing few-shot knowledge graph completion approaches have primarily focused on positive triples, neglecting the significant role of negative triples. To address this, the authors propose a novel method called Relation-Based Conditional Diffusion with Attention Pooling (ReCDAP). The approach involves generating negative triples by randomly altering the tail entity in a support set. In ReCDAP, both positive and negative relations are considered during the diffusion process, allowing the model to estimate distinct latent distributions for each. This isolation permits the model to better capture the nuances of positive and negative cases. The integration of an attention pooler further enhances the model's ability to differentiate between these cases, leading to improved results. Experiments conducted on two prominent datasets demonstrate that ReCDAP outperforms previous methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in few-shot knowledge graph completion tasks. The effectiveness of this new approach underscores its potential to advance performance in knowledge graph-related applications. The research code can be accessed at https://github.com/hou27/ReCDAP-FKGC. <div>
arXiv:2505.07171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs), composed of triples in the form of (head, relation, tail) and consisting of entities and relations, play a key role in information retrieval systems such as question answering, entity search, and recommendation. In real-world KGs, although many entities exist, the relations exhibit a long-tail distribution, which can hinder information retrieval performance. Previous few-shot knowledge graph completion studies focused exclusively on the positive triple information that exists in the graph or, when negative triples were incorporated, used them merely as a signal to indicate incorrect triples. To overcome this limitation, we propose Relation-Based Conditional Diffusion with Attention Pooling (ReCDAP). First, negative triples are generated by randomly replacing the tail entity in the support set. By conditionally incorporating positive information in the KG and non-existent negative information into the diffusion process, the model separately estimates the latent distributions for positive and negative relations. Moreover, including an attention pooler enables the model to leverage the differences between positive and negative cases explicitly. Experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at https://github.com/hou27/ReCDAP-FKGC.

Summary: The paper examines the issue of accountability in generative AI systems, emphasizing that transparency alone is not enough and proposing the use of the precautionary principle to address AI risks. It suggests that when generative AI systems are not transparent, they become like "artificially created nature," and advocates for a platform for citizen participation to mitigate these risks. The research highlights the complexities of tracing the reasons behind the outputs of AI technologies and the need to involve the public in decision-making processes to ensure the responsible development and deployment of generative AI. <div>

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies raises concerns about the accountability of sociotechnical systems. Current generative AI systems rely on complex mechanisms that make it difficult for even experts to fully trace the reasons behind the outputs. This paper first examines existing research on AI transparency and accountability and argues that transparency is not a sufficient condition for accountability but can contribute to its improvement. We then discuss that if it is not possible to make generative AI transparent, generative AI technology becomes ``artificially created nature'' in a metaphorical sense, and suggest using the precautionary principle approach to consider AI risks. Finally, we propose that a platform for citizen participation is needed to address the risks of generative AI.

Summary: 
gg-bench is a collection of game environments created to evaluate the general reasoning capabilities of language models. Unlike traditional static benchmarks, gg-bench allows for the generation of new evaluation instances on demand. The process involves using a large language model to generate descriptions of unique games, implementing these games as Gym environments in code, and training reinforcement learning agents through self-play on the generated games. The evaluation of language models is done based on their winrate against these RL agents in a prompted scenario where models make moves based on provided game descriptions, current board states, and valid moves. State-of-the-art language models achieve winrates of 7-9% on gg-bench using in-context learning, while reasoning models reach 31-36%. The authors provide the generated games, data generation process, and evaluation code to support future research and expansion of the benchmark.

Abstract: We present gg-bench, a collection of game environments designed to evaluate general reasoning capabilities in language models. Unlike most static benchmarks, gg-bench is a data generating process where new evaluation instances can be generated at will. In particular, gg-bench is synthetically generated by (1) using a large language model (LLM) to generate natural language descriptions of novel games, (2) using the LLM to implement each game in code as a Gym environment, and (3) training reinforcement learning (RL) agents via self-play on the generated games. We evaluate language models by their winrate against these RL agents by prompting models with the game description, current board state, and a list of valid moves, after which models output the moves they wish to take. gg-bench is challenging: state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieve winrates of 7-9% on gg-bench using in-context learning, while reasoning models such as o1, o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 achieve average winrates of 31-36%. We release the generated games, data generation process, and evaluation code in order to support future modeling work and expansion of our benchmark.

<div> Keywords: event diagnosis, counterfactual explanations, water systems, interpretability, sensor measurements  

<br><br>Summary: The study addresses the growing use of information and communication technologies in water system management, particularly in detecting unexpected events like leaks or contamination. While data-driven methods support these efforts, they often lack accuracy and operator trust, leading personnel to rely more on their intuition. To bridge this gap, the authors introduce a framework for interpretable event diagnosis. This framework aids operators by linking algorithmic results with their engineering experience through counterfactual explanations. These explanations highlight the differences between the current event diagnosis and the nearest alternative scenario, enhancing understanding of the algorithms' functions. The proposed tool, termed "counterfactual event fingerprints," visually captures these differences, enabling operators to make more informed decisions by merging algorithmic insights with personal expertise. The methodology is validated using a realistic case study based on the L-Town benchmark, demonstrating its practical application and effectiveness in improving operator confidence and decision-making in water systems management. <div>

Abstract: The increasing penetration of information and communication technologies in the design, monitoring, and control of water systems enables the use of algorithms for detecting and identifying unanticipated events (such as leakages or water contamination) using sensor measurements. However, data-driven methodologies do not always give accurate results and are often not trusted by operators, who may prefer to use their engineering judgment and experience to deal with such events.
  In this work, we propose a framework for interpretable event diagnosis -- an approach that assists the operators in associating the results of algorithmic event diagnosis methodologies with their own intuition and experience. This is achieved by providing contrasting (i.e., counterfactual) explanations of the results provided by fault diagnosis algorithms; their aim is to improve the understanding of the algorithm's inner workings by the operators, thus enabling them to take a more informed decision by combining the results with their personal experiences. Specifically, we propose counterfactual event fingerprints, a representation of the difference between the current event diagnosis and the closest alternative explanation, which can be presented in a graphical way. The proposed methodology is applied and evaluated on a realistic use case using the L-Town benchmark.

Summary:
Federated learning is proposed as a solution for start-ups struggling with training fault diagnosis models due to limited industrial data. However, varying working conditions lead to inconsistent label spaces among clients, affecting the generalization of the global model. To address this, the article introduces the Federated Invariant Features Learning (FedIFL) framework. Prototype contrastive learning and feature generation are utilized for intra-client training to mitigate domain shifts. A feature disentanglement mechanism and instance-level consistency loss are introduced for cross-client training. Additionally, federated instance personalization and orthogonal losses help distinguish specific features from invariant ones. The aggregated model produced by FedIFL demonstrates improved generalization across global label spaces, enabling accurate fault diagnosis for Motor Driven Systems with diverse fault modes. Experiments on real-world MDSs confirm the effectiveness and superiority of FedIFL in addressing inconsistencies in federated cross-domain diagnosis. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Due to the scarcity of industrial data, individual equipment users, particularly start-ups, struggle to independently train a comprehensive fault diagnosis model; federated learning enables collaborative training while ensuring data privacy, making it an ideal solution. However, the diversity of working conditions leads to variations in fault modes, resulting in inconsistent label spaces across different clients. In federated diagnostic scenarios, label space inconsistency leads to local models focus on client-specific fault modes and causes local models from different clients to map different failure modes to similar feature representations, which weakens the aggregated global model's generalization. To tackle this issue, this article proposed a federated cross-domain diagnostic framework termed Federated Invariant Features Learning (FedIFL). In intra-client training, prototype contrastive learning mitigates intra-client domain shifts, subsequently, feature generating ensures local models can access distributions of other clients in a privacy-friendly manner. Besides, in cross-client training, a feature disentanglement mechanism is introduced to mitigate cross-client domain shifts, specifically, an instance-level federated instance consistency loss is designed to ensure the instance-level consistency of invariant features between different clients, furthermore, a federated instance personalization loss and an orthogonal loss are constructed to distinguish specific features that from the invariant features. Eventually, the aggregated model achieves promising generalization among global label spaces, enabling accurate fault diagnosis for target clients' Motor Driven Systems (MDSs) with inconsistent label spaces. Experiments on real-world MDSs validate the effectiveness and superiority of FedIFL in federated cross-domain diagnosis with inconsistent fault modes.

Abstract: With the increasing demands for safety, efficiency, and sustainability in global shipping, Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays an increasingly important role in maritime monitoring. AIS data contains spatial-temporal variation patterns of vessels that hold significant research value in the marine domain. However, due to its massive scale, the full potential of AIS data has long remained untapped. With its powerful sequence modeling capabilities, particularly its ability to capture long-range dependencies and complex temporal dynamics, the Transformer model has emerged as an effective tool for processing AIS data. Therefore, this paper reviews the research on Transformer-based AIS data-driven maritime monitoring, providing a comprehensive overview of the current applications of Transformer models in the marine field. The focus is on Transformer-based trajectory prediction methods, behavior detection, and prediction techniques. Additionally, this paper collects and organizes publicly available AIS datasets from the reviewed papers, performing data filtering, cleaning, and statistical analysis. The statistical results reveal the operational characteristics of different vessel types, providing data support for further research on maritime monitoring tasks. Finally, we offer valuable suggestions for future research, identifying two promising research directions. Datasets are available at https://github.com/eyesofworld/Maritime-Monitoring.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are proficient in natural language tasks but lack adequate reasoning capabilities over tabular data. Current evaluation strategies fail to reflect LLMs' realistic performance on tabular queries. This study aims to assess LLMs' robustness towards real-world variations in tabular inputs and establish realistic evaluation methods for their analytical performance. By scrutinizing an existing tabular reasoning benchmark, the study reveals deficiencies in the evaluation metrics commonly used in this context. A novel LLM-as-a-judge approach provides more reliable performance insights, indicating a significant deficit in LLMs' tabular reasoning abilities. Further experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle with various real-world tabular input characteristics, including missing values, duplicate entities, and structural variations. Improving the robustness of LLMs for such scenarios is crucial for enhancing their effectiveness in handling analytical tabular data.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks, but less is known about their reasoning capabilities over tabular data. Prior analyses devise evaluation strategies that poorly reflect an LLM's realistic performance on tabular queries. Moreover, we have a limited understanding of the robustness of LLMs towards realistic variations in tabular inputs. Therefore, we ask: Can general-purpose LLMs reason over tabular data, really?, and focus on two questions 1) are tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs robust to real-world characteristics of tabular inputs, and 2) how can we realistically evaluate an LLM's performance on analytical tabular queries? Building on a recent tabular reasoning benchmark, we first surface shortcomings of its multiple-choice prompt evaluation strategy, as well as commonly used free-form text metrics such as SacreBleu and BERT-score. We show that an LLM-as-a-judge procedure yields more reliable performance insights and unveil a significant deficit in tabular reasoning performance of LLMs. We then extend the tabular inputs reflecting three common characteristics in practice: 1) missing values, 2) duplicate entities, and 3) structural variations. Experiments show that the tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs suffer from these variations, stressing the importance of improving their robustness for realistic tabular inputs.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Small Language Models (SLMs) have their own strengths and weaknesses in terms of performance, resource costs, and deployability. The collaboration between LLMs and SLMs is crucial to strike a balance between these trade-offs. Various interaction mechanisms such as pipeline, routing, auxiliary, distillation, and fusion enable efficient AI applications on resource-constrained edge devices. The survey provides insights into key enabling technologies and application scenarios driven by on-device needs like low latency, privacy, and personalization. Despite the potential for creating more adaptable and accessible AI, challenges such as system overhead, inter-model consistency, task allocation, evaluation complexity, and security/privacy concerns persist. Future directions include intelligent adaptive frameworks, deeper model fusion, and expansion into multimodal and embodied AI, positioning LLM-SLM collaboration as a key driver for the next generation of ubiquitous artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful AI capabilities but face deployment challenges due to high resource costs and latency, whereas Small Language Models (SLMs) offer efficiency and deployability at the cost of reduced performance. Collaboration between LLMs and SLMs emerges as a crucial paradigm to synergistically balance these trade-offs, enabling advanced AI applications, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of LLM-SLM collaboration, detailing various interaction mechanisms (pipeline, routing, auxiliary, distillation, fusion), key enabling technologies, and diverse application scenarios driven by on-device needs like low latency, privacy, personalization, and offline operation. While highlighting the significant potential for creating more efficient, adaptable, and accessible AI, we also discuss persistent challenges including system overhead, inter-model consistency, robust task allocation, evaluation complexity, and security/privacy concerns. Future directions point towards more intelligent adaptive frameworks, deeper model fusion, and expansion into multimodal and embodied AI, positioning LLM-SLM collaboration as a key driver for the next generation of practical and ubiquitous artificial intelligence.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly applied in the field of coding, moving from code assistants to generating complete projects through natural language. Existing benchmarks for LLMs have become saturated, with high accuracy levels. To address this issue, a new benchmark, Web-Bench, has been proposed, consisting of 50 projects with sequential tasks mimicking real-world development workflows in Web development. These projects, designed by experienced engineers, pose significant challenges and take several hours to complete. Testing on the Web-Agent benchmark, a state-of-the-art model achieved a Pass@1 rate of 25.1%, lower than on existing software engineering benchmarks. The importance of Web Standards and Web Frameworks is highlighted in the benchmark, suggesting the need for LLM optimization tailored to these foundational elements in development.<br><br>Summary: Large language models are increasingly used in coding, with new benchmarks like Web-Bench introduced to address saturation in existing benchmarks.

Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) in the field of coding is evolving rapidly: from code assistants, to autonomous coding agents, and then to generating complete projects through natural language. Early LLM code benchmarks primarily focused on code generation accuracy, but these benchmarks have gradually become saturated. Benchmark saturation weakens their guiding role for LLMs. For example, HumanEval Pass@1 has reached 99.4% and MBPP 94.2%. Among various attempts to address benchmark saturation, approaches based on software engineering have stood out, but the saturation of existing software engineering benchmarks is rapidly increasing. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, Web-Bench, which contains 50 projects, each consisting of 20 tasks with sequential dependencies. The tasks implement project features in sequence, simulating real-world human development workflows. When designing Web-Bench, we aim to cover the foundational elements of Web development: Web Standards and Web Frameworks. Given the scale and complexity of these projects, which were designed by engineers with 5 to 10 years of experience, each presents a significant challenge. On average, a single project takes 4 to 8 hours for a senior engineer to complete. On our given benchmark agent (Web-Agent), SOTA (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) achieves only 25.1% Pass@1, significantly lower (better) than SWE-Bench's Verified (65.4%) and Full (33.8%) scores. Finally, we discuss that in any development field, Standards and Frameworks represent foundational knowledge and efficiency tools, respectively, and LLMs require optimization tailored to them.

<div> Temporal Knowledge Graphs, Outdated Facts, Reasoning Methods, HALO Framework, Half-life Theory <br>
Summary: <br>
The article introduces HALO, a framework designed to filter outdated facts in Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). Existing reasoning methods often overlook the negative impact of outdated facts on TKG performance. HALO addresses this issue by quantifying the temporal validity of historical facts using the half-life theory. The framework consists of three key modules: temporal fact attention, dynamic relation-aware encoder, and outdated fact filtering. By capturing the evolution of historical facts and predicting their half-life, HALO effectively filters outdated facts, improving TKG reasoning performance. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate HALO's superiority over state-of-the-art methods. The code for HALO is available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Outdated facts in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) result from exceeding the expiration date of facts, which negatively impact reasoning performance on TKGs. However, existing reasoning methods primarily focus on positive importance of historical facts, neglecting adverse effects of outdated facts. Besides, training on these outdated facts yields extra computational cost. To address these challenges, we propose an outdated fact filtering framework named HALO, which quantifies the temporal validity of historical facts by exploring the half-life theory to filter outdated facts in TKGs. HALO consists of three modules: the temporal fact attention module, the dynamic relation-aware encoder module, and the outdated fact filtering module. Firstly, the temporal fact attention module captures the evolution of historical facts over time to identify relevant facts. Secondly, the dynamic relation-aware encoder module is designed for efficiently predicting the half life of each fact. Finally, we construct a time decay function based on the half-life theory to quantify the temporal validity of facts and filter outdated facts. Experimental results show that HALO outperforms the state-of-the-art TKG reasoning methods on three public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and filtering outdated facts (Codes are available at https://github.com/yushuowiki/K-Half/tree/main ).

Summary: <br>
QuantX is a suite of recipes designed for quantizing LLM and VLM models, achieving high performance with minimal loss when quantized to 3-bit resolutions. The strategies in QuantX consider hardware constraints to ensure efficient dequantization during inference, allowing for a flexible balance between runtime speed, memory usage, and model accuracy. Results show that QuantX performs within 6% of the unquantized model for LlaVa-v1.6 quantized to 3 bits across various end user tasks, surpassing recent state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Leveraging large language model (LLM) based agents to simulate human social behaviors has recently gained significant attention. In this paper, we introduce a novel social simulator called YuLan-OneSim. Compared to previous works, YuLan-OneSim distinguishes itself in five key aspects: (1) Code-free scenario construction: Users can simply describe and refine their simulation scenarios through natural language interactions with our simulator. All simulation code is automatically generated, significantly reducing the need for programming expertise. (2) Comprehensive default scenarios: We implement 50 default simulation scenarios spanning 8 domains, including economics, sociology, politics, psychology, organization, demographics, law, and communication, broadening access for a diverse range of social researchers. (3) Evolvable simulation: Our simulator is capable of receiving external feedback and automatically fine-tuning the backbone LLMs, significantly enhancing the simulation quality. (4) Large-scale simulation: By developing a fully responsive agent framework and a distributed simulation architecture, our simulator can handle up to 100,000 agents, ensuring more stable and reliable simulation results. (5) AI social researcher: Leveraging the above features, we develop an AI social researcher. Users only need to propose a research topic, and the AI researcher will automatically analyze the input, construct simulation environments, summarize results, generate technical reports, review and refine the reports--completing the social science research loop. To demonstrate the advantages of YuLan-OneSim, we conduct experiments to evaluate the quality of the automatically generated scenarios, the reliability, efficiency, and scalability of the simulation process, as well as the performance of the AI social researcher.

<div> Keywords: Test-Time Scaling, reasoning capabilities, S-GRPO, early exit, sequence length reduction

<br><br>Summary: This paper addresses the issue of excessive thought redundancy in chain-of-thought (CoT) generation within reasoning models, particularly highlighting the limitations of conventional outcome-reward reinforcement learning methods. To tackle this, the authors introduce Serial-Group Decaying-Reward Policy Optimization (S-GRPO), a novel approach that allows models to evaluate the necessity of reasoning steps, enabling early exits from CoT generation. Unlike traditional methods that sample multiple completions in parallel, S-GRPO focuses on selecting multiple temporal positions within a single CoT, managing exits based on reasoning sufficiency. Rewards are assigned based on the correctness of answers with a decaying structure, incentivizing models to produce high-quality answers earlier in the reasoning process. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of S-GRPO, showing compatibility with advanced reasoning models such as Qwen3 and Deepseek-distill. The results indicate significant improvements, achieving a sequence length reduction of 35.4% to 61.1% and an accuracy boost of 0.72% to 6.08% across various benchmarks, including GSM8K and AIME 2024, thus enhancing reasoning efficiency in large language models. <div>
arXiv:2505.07686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Test-Time Scaling emerges as an active research focus in the large language model community, advanced post-training methods increasingly emphasize extending chain-of-thought (CoT) generation length, thereby enhancing reasoning capabilities to approach Deepseek R1-like reasoning models. However, recent studies reveal that reasoning models (even Qwen3) consistently exhibit excessive thought redundancy in CoT generation. This overthinking problem stems from conventional outcome-reward reinforcement learning's systematic neglect in regulating intermediate reasoning steps. This paper proposes Serial-Group Decaying-Reward Policy Optimization (namely S-GRPO), a novel reinforcement learning method that empowers models with the capability to determine the sufficiency of reasoning steps, subsequently triggering early exit of CoT generation. Specifically, unlike GRPO, which samples multiple possible completions (parallel group) in parallel, we select multiple temporal positions in the generation of one CoT to allow the model to exit thinking and instead generate answers (serial group), respectively. For the correct answers in a serial group, we assign rewards that decay according to positions, with lower rewards towards the later ones, thereby reinforcing the model's behavior to generate higher-quality answers at earlier phases with earlier exits of thinking. Empirical evaluations demonstrate compatibility with state-of-the-art reasoning models, including Qwen3 and Deepseek-distill models, achieving 35.4% ~ 61.1\% sequence length reduction with 0.72% ~ 6.08% accuracy improvements across GSM8K, AIME 2024, AMC 2023, MATH-500, and GPQA Diamond benchmarks.

Summary:
Belief injection is introduced as a proactive epistemic control mechanism for artificial agents with structured cognitive states. It involves incorporating targeted linguistic beliefs directly into an agent's internal cognitive state to influence reasoning and alignment proactively. Various injection strategies, including direct, context-aware, goal-oriented, and reflective approaches, are delineated. Belief injection is compared to belief filtering, another epistemic control mechanism. Practical applications, implementation considerations, ethical implications, and future research directions in cognitive governance using belief injection are discussed. <div>

Abstract: This work introduces belief injection, a proactive epistemic control mechanism for artificial agents whose cognitive states are structured as dynamic ensembles of linguistic belief fragments. Grounded in the Semantic Manifold framework, belief injection directly incorporates targeted linguistic beliefs into an agent's internal cognitive state, influencing reasoning and alignment proactively rather than reactively. We delineate various injection strategies, such as direct, context-aware, goal-oriented, and reflective approaches, and contrast belief injection with related epistemic control mechanisms, notably belief filtering. Additionally, this work discusses practical applications, implementation considerations, ethical implications, and outlines promising directions for future research into cognitive governance using architecturally embedded belief injection.

Summary:
The Emotion-Gradient Metacognitive Recursive Self-Improvement (EG-MRSI) framework integrates introspective metacognition, emotion-based intrinsic motivation, and recursive self-modification. It is capable of overwriting its own learning algorithm with bounded risk, building upon the Noise-to-Meaning RSI (N2M-RSI) foundation. The framework introduces a differentiable intrinsic reward function driven by confidence, error, novelty, and cumulative success, regulating metacognitive mapping and self-modification. Initial agent configuration, emotion-gradient dynamics, and RSI trigger conditions are formally defined. A reinforcement-compatible optimization objective guides the agent's development trajectory. Meaning Density and Meaning Conversion Efficiency are quantifiable metrics introduced to measure semantic learning. Future parts of EG-MRSI will extend to include safety certificates, collective intelligence mechanisms, and feasibility constraints, providing a rigorous foundation for open-ended and safe AGI.

Abstract: We present the Emotion-Gradient Metacognitive Recursive Self-Improvement (EG-MRSI) framework, a novel architecture that integrates introspective metacognition, emotion-based intrinsic motivation, and recursive self-modification into a unified theoretical system. The framework is explicitly capable of overwriting its own learning algorithm under formally bounded risk. Building upon the Noise-to-Meaning RSI (N2M-RSI) foundation, EG-MRSI introduces a differentiable intrinsic reward function driven by confidence, error, novelty, and cumulative success. This signal regulates both a metacognitive mapping and a self-modification operator constrained by provable safety mechanisms. We formally define the initial agent configuration, emotion-gradient dynamics, and RSI trigger conditions, and derive a reinforcement-compatible optimization objective that guides the agent's development trajectory. Meaning Density and Meaning Conversion Efficiency are introduced as quantifiable metrics of semantic learning, closing the gap between internal structure and predictive informativeness. This Part I paper establishes the single-agent theoretical foundations of EG-MRSI. Future parts will extend this framework to include safety certificates and rollback protocols (Part II), collective intelligence mechanisms (Part III), and feasibility constraints including thermodynamic and computational limits (Part IV). Together, the EG-MRSI series provides a rigorous, extensible foundation for open-ended and safe AGI.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Virtual Assistants (VAs) e.g., Google Gemini, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and High-Flyer Deepseek has turned them into convenient interfaces for managing emerging technologies such as Smart Homes, Smart Cars, Electronic Health Records, by means of explicit commands,e.g., prompts, which can be even launched via voice, thus providing a very convenient interface for end-users. However, the proper specification and evaluation of User-Managed Access Control Policies (U-MAPs), the rules issued and managed by end-users to govern access to sensitive data and device functionality - within these VAs presents significant challenges, since such a process is crucial for preventing security vulnerabilities and privacy leaks without impacting user experience. This study provides an initial exploratory investigation on whether current publicly-available VAs can manage U-MAPs effectively across differing scenarios. By conducting unstructured to structured tests, we evaluated the comprehension of such VAs, revealing a lack of understanding in varying U-MAP approaches. Our research not only identifies key limitations, but offers valuable insights into how VAs can be further improved to manage complex authorization rules and adapt to dynamic changes.

Summary:<br>
The study explores the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train Large Language Models (LLMs) in spontaneously generating and executing Python code for mathematical tasks. The approach, called ZeroTIR, focuses on training agents to leverage external tools like code execution without explicit examples. Through rigorous experimentation, the researchers found that increased RL training steps directly correlate with higher frequencies of code execution, longer response lengths, and improved task accuracy. A decoupled code execution environment was implemented to validate the effectiveness of ZeroTIR across various RL algorithms and frameworks. Results show that ZeroTIR outperforms non-tool RL baselines on challenging math benchmarks, highlighting the importance of autonomous tool use in Agent RL. The findings provide valuable insights into how agents acquire and scale tool-augmented reasoning strategies, serving as a reproducible benchmark for future research efforts. The code implementation is publicly available for further exploration and experimentation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks requiring precise, verifiable computation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.

Summary:
Peripheral nerve interfaces (PNIs) are crucial for neural recording and stimulation to treat nerve injuries, but real-time classification of electroneurographic (ENG) signals is challenging due to complexity and latency constraints. A new lightweight architecture, MobilESCAPE-Net, has been developed to address these challenges. Compared to the existing ESCAPE-Net, MobilESCAPE-Net maintains similar accuracy and F1-score while reducing complexity significantly. It reduces trainable parameters by 99.9% and floating point operations per second by 92.47%, enabling faster inference and real-time processing. This efficiency makes MobilESCAPE-Net ideal for low-complexity ENG signal classification in resource-limited environments like implantable devices. <div>

Abstract: Digital Predistortion (DPD) is a popular technique to enhance signal quality in wideband RF power amplifiers (PAs). With increasing bandwidth and data rates, DPD faces significant energy consumption challenges during deployment, contrasting with its efficiency goals. State-of-the-art DPD models rely on recurrent neural networks (RNN), whose computational complexity hinders system efficiency. This paper introduces DeltaDPD, exploring the dynamic temporal sparsity of input signals and neuronal hidden states in RNNs for energy-efficient DPD, reducing arithmetic operations and memory accesses while preserving satisfactory linearization performance. Applying a TM3.1a 200MHz-BW 256-QAM OFDM signal to a 3.5 GHz GaN Doherty RF PA, DeltaDPD achieves -50.03 dBc in Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR), -37.22 dB in Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) and -38.52 dBc in Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) with 52% temporal sparsity, leading to a 1.8X reduction in estimated inference power. The DeltaDPD code will be released after formal publication at https://www.opendpd.com.

Abstract: Intelligent spectrum management is crucial for improving spectrum efficiency and achieving secure utilization of spectrum resources. However, existing intelligent spectrum management methods, typically based on small-scale models, suffer from notable limitations in recognition accuracy, convergence speed, and generalization, particularly in the complex and dynamic spectrum environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, establishing a new paradigm for spectrum management. SpectrumFM features an innovative encoder architecture that synergistically exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and enable robust representation learning. The model is pre-trained via two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, which leverage large-scale in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data to achieve comprehensive and transferable spectrum representations. Furthermore, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy is proposed to enable SpectrumFM to adapt to various downstream spectrum management tasks, including automatic modulation classification (AMC), wireless technology classification (WTC), spectrum sensing (SS), and anomaly detection (AD). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpectrumFM achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, adaptability, few-shot learning efficiency, and convergence speed, consistently outperforming conventional methods across multiple benchmarks. Specifically, SpectrumFM improves AMC accuracy by up to 12.1% and WTC accuracy by 9.3%, achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 in SS at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and enhances AD performance by over 10%.

Abstract: Attending to what is relevant is fundamental to both the mammalian brain and modern machine learning models such as Transformers. Yet, determining relevance remains a core challenge, traditionally offloaded to learning algorithms like backpropagation. Inspired by recent cellular neurobiological evidence linking neocortical pyramidal cells to distinct mental states, this work shows how models (e.g., Transformers) can emulate high-level perceptual processing and awake thought (imagination) states to pre-select relevant information before applying attention. Triadic neuronal-level modulation loops among questions ($Q$), clues (keys, $K$), and hypotheses (values, $V$) enable diverse, deep, parallel reasoning chains at the representation level and allow a rapid shift from initial biases to refined understanding. This leads to orders-of-magnitude faster learning with significantly reduced computational demand (e.g., fewer heads, layers, and tokens), at an approximate cost of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, where $N$ is the number of input tokens. Results span reinforcement learning (e.g., CarRacing in a high-dimensional visual setup), computer vision, and natural language question answering.

Abstract: Attribution algorithms are essential for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of deep learning models by identifying key features driving model decisions. Existing frameworks, such as InterpretDL and OmniXAI, integrate multiple attribution methods but suffer from scalability limitations, high coupling, theoretical constraints, and lack of user-friendly implementations, hindering neural network transparency and interoperability. To address these challenges, we propose Attribution-Based Explainability (ABE), a unified framework that formalizes Fundamental Attribution Methods and integrates state-of-the-art attribution algorithms while ensuring compliance with attribution axioms. ABE enables researchers to develop novel attribution techniques and enhances interpretability through four customizable modules: Robustness, Interpretability, Validation, and Data & Model. This framework provides a scalable, extensible foundation for advancing attribution-based explainability and fostering transparent AI systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/LMBTough/ABE-XAI.

<title>Fair Clustering with Clusterlets</title>

Abstract: Given their widespread usage in the real world, the fairness of clustering methods has become of major interest. Theoretical results on fair clustering show that fairness enjoys transitivity: given a set of small and fair clusters, a trivial centroid-based clustering algorithm yields a fair clustering. Unfortunately, discovering a suitable starting clustering can be computationally expensive, rather complex or arbitrary.
  In this paper, we propose a set of simple \emph{clusterlet}-based fuzzy clustering algorithms that match single-class clusters, optimizing fair clustering. Matching leverages clusterlet distance, optimizing for classic clustering objectives, while also regularizing for fairness. Empirical results show that simple matching strategies are able to achieve high fairness, and that appropriate parameter tuning allows to achieve high cohesion and low overlap.

Abstract: In the context of the new mandatory labor compliance in the European Union (EU), which will be implemented in 2027, supply chain enterprises face stringent working hour management requirements and compliance risks. In order to scientifically predict the enterprises' coping behaviors and performance outcomes under the policy impact, this paper constructs a methodological framework that integrates the AI synthetic data generation mechanism and structural path regression modeling to simulate the enterprises' strategic transition paths under the new regulations. In terms of research methodology, this paper adopts high-quality simulation data generated based on Monte Carlo mechanism and NIST synthetic data standards to construct a structural path analysis model that includes multiple linear regression, logistic regression, mediation effect and moderating effect. The variable system covers 14 indicators such as enterprise working hours, compliance investment, response speed, automation level, policy dependence, etc. The variable set with explanatory power is screened out through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and VIF multicollinearity elimination. The findings show that compliance investment has a significant positive impact on firm survival and its effect is transmitted through the mediating path of the level of intelligence; meanwhile, firms' dependence on the EU market significantly moderates the strength of this mediating effect. It is concluded that AI synthetic data combined with structural path modeling provides an effective tool for high-intensity regulatory simulation, which can provide a quantitative basis for corporate strategic response, policy design and AI-assisted decision-making in the pre-prediction stage lacking real scenario data. Keywords: AI synthetic data, structural path regression modeling, compliance response strategy, EU 2027 mandatory labor regulation

Abstract: We introduce Dialz, a framework for advancing research on steering vectors for open-source LLMs, implemented in Python. Steering vectors allow users to modify activations at inference time to amplify or weaken a 'concept', e.g. honesty or positivity, providing a more powerful alternative to prompting or fine-tuning. Dialz supports a diverse set of tasks, including creating contrastive pair datasets, computing and applying steering vectors, and visualizations. Unlike existing libraries, Dialz emphasizes modularity and usability, enabling both rapid prototyping and in-depth analysis. We demonstrate how Dialz can be used to reduce harmful outputs such as stereotypes, while also providing insights into model behaviour across different layers. We release Dialz with full documentation, tutorials, and support for popular open-source models to encourage further research in safe and controllable language generation. Dialz enables faster research cycles and facilitates insights into model interpretability, paving the way for safer, more transparent, and more reliable AI systems.

Abstract: Delirium represents a significant clinical concern characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study investigates the associated risk factors for delirium by analyzing the comorbidity patterns relevant to MCI and developing a longitudinal predictive model leveraging machine learning methodologies. A retrospective analysis utilizing the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database was performed to evaluate comorbid conditions, survival probabilities, and predictive modeling outcomes. The examination of comorbidity patterns identified distinct risk profiles for the MCI population. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that individuals with MCI exhibit markedly reduced survival probabilities when developing delirium compared to their non-MCI counterparts, underscoring the heightened vulnerability within this cohort. For predictive modeling, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) ML network was implemented utilizing time-series data, demographic variables, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores, and an array of comorbid conditions. The model demonstrated robust predictive capabilities with an AUROC of 0.93 and an AUPRC of 0.92. This study underscores the critical role of comorbidities in evaluating delirium risk and highlights the efficacy of time-series predictive modeling in pinpointing patients at elevated risk for delirium development.

Abstract: Agricultural monitoring is critical for ensuring food security, maintaining sustainable farming practices, informing policies on mitigating food shortage, and managing greenhouse gas emissions. Traditional process-based physical models are often designed and implemented for specific situations, and their parameters could also be highly uncertain. In contrast, data-driven models often use black-box structures and does not explicitly model the inter-dependence between different ecological variables. As a result, they require extensive training data and lack generalizability to different tasks with data distribution shifts and inconsistent observed variables. To address the need for more universal models, we propose a knowledge-guided encoder-decoder model, which can predict key crop variables by leveraging knowledge of underlying processes from multiple physical models. The proposed method also integrates a language model to process complex and inconsistent inputs and also utilizes it to implement a model selection mechanism for selectively combining the knowledge from different physical models. Our evaluations on predicting carbon and nitrogen fluxes for multiple sites demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model under various scenarios.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation, exemplified by GitHub Copilot\footnote{A coding extension powered by a Code-LLM to assist in code completion tasks} surpassing a million users, highlights the transformative potential of these tools in improving developer productivity. However, this rapid growth also underscores critical concerns regarding the quality, safety, and reliability of the code they generate. As Code-LLMs evolve, they face significant challenges, including the diminishing returns of model scaling and the scarcity of new, high-quality training data. To address these issues, this paper introduces Adversarial Knowledge Distillation (AKD), a novel approach that leverages adversarially generated synthetic datasets to distill the capabilities of larger models into smaller, more efficient ones. By systematically stress-testing and refining the reasoning capabilities of Code-LLMs, AKD provides a framework for enhancing model robustness, reliability, and security while improving their parameter-efficiency. We believe this work represents a critical step toward ensuring dependable automated code generation within the constraints of existing data and the cost-efficiency of model execution.

Abstract: The aggregation efficiency and accuracy of wireless Federated Learning (FL) are significantly affected by resource constraints, especially in heterogeneous environments where devices exhibit distinct data distributions and communication capabilities. This paper proposes a clustering strategy that leverages prior knowledge similarity to group devices with similar data and communication characteristics, mitigating performance degradation from heterogeneity. On this basis, a novel Cluster- Aware Multi-round Update (CAMU) strategy is proposed, which treats clusters as the basic units and adjusts the local update frequency based on the clustered contribution threshold, effectively reducing update bias and enhancing aggregation accuracy. The theoretical convergence of the CAMU strategy is rigorously validated. Meanwhile, based on the convergence upper bound, the local update frequency and transmission power of each cluster are jointly optimized to achieve an optimal balance between computation and communication resources under constrained conditions, significantly improving the convergence efficiency of FL. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the model performance of FL in heterogeneous environments and achieves a better balance between communication cost and computational load under limited resources.

Abstract: Although deep learning models owe their remarkable success to deep and complex architectures, this very complexity typically comes at the expense of real-time performance. To address this issue, a variety of model compression techniques have been proposed, among which knowledge distillation (KD) stands out for its strong empirical performance. The KD contains two concurrent processes: (i) matching the outputs of a large, pre-trained teacher network and a lightweight student network, and (ii) training the student to solve its designated downstream task. The associated loss functions are termed the distillation loss and the downsteam-task loss, respectively. Numerous prior studies report that KD is most effective when the influence of the distillation loss outweighs that of the downstream-task loss. The influence(or importance) is typically regulated by a balancing parameter. This paper provides a mathematical rationale showing that in a simple KD setting when the loss is decreasing, the balancing parameter should be dynamically adjusted

Abstract: Auscultation remains a cornerstone of clinical practice, essential for both initial evaluation and continuous monitoring. Clinicians listen to the lung sounds and make a diagnosis by combining the patient's medical history and test results. Given this strong association, multitask learning (MTL) can offer a compelling framework to simultaneously model these relationships, integrating respiratory sound patterns with disease manifestations. While MTL has shown considerable promise in medical applications, a significant research gap remains in understanding the complex interplay between respiratory sounds, disease manifestations, and patient metadata attributes. This study investigates how integrating MTL with cutting-edge deep learning architectures can enhance both respiratory sound classification and disease diagnosis. Specifically, we extend recent findings regarding the beneficial impact of metadata on respiratory sound classification by evaluating its effectiveness within an MTL framework. Our comprehensive experiments reveal significant improvements in both lung sound classification and diagnostic performance when the stethoscope information is incorporated into the MTL architecture.

<title>A Sensitivity-Driven Expert Allocation Method in LoRA-MoE for Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: As deep learning models expand, the pre-training-fine-tuning paradigm has become the standard approach for handling various downstream tasks. However, shared parameters can lead to diminished performance when dealing with complex datasets involving multiple tasks. While introducing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods has alleviated this issue to some extent, it also significantly increases the number of parameters required for fine-tuning and training time, introducing greater parameter redundancy. To address these challenges, we propose a method for allocating expert numbers based on parameter sensitivity LoRA-SMoE (A Sensitivity-Driven Expert Allocation Method in LoRA-MoE for Efficient Fine-Tuning). This method rapidly assesses the sensitivity of different tasks to parameters by sampling a small amount of data and using gradient information. It then adaptively allocates expert numbers within a given budget. The process maintains comparable memory consumption to LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) while ensuring an efficient and resource-friendly fine-tuning procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to SOTA fine-tuning methods, our LoRA-SMoE approach can enhance model performance while reducing the number of trainable parameters. This significantly improves model performance in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, due to its efficient parameter sensitivity evaluation mechanism, LoRA-SMoE requires minimal computational overhead to optimize expert allocation, making it particularly suitable for scenarios with limited computational resources. All the code in this study will be made publicly available following the acceptance of the paper for publication. Source code is at https://github.com/EMLS-ICTCAS/LoRA-SMoE

Abstract: To design rewards that align with human goals, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent technique for learning reward functions from human preferences and optimizing policies via reinforcement learning algorithms. However, existing RLHF methods often misinterpret trajectories as being generated by an optimal policy, causing inaccurate likelihood estimation and suboptimal learning. Inspired by Direct Preference Optimization framework which directly learns optimal policy without explicit reward, we propose policy-labeled preference learning (PPL), to resolve likelihood mismatch issues by modeling human preferences with regret, which reflects behavior policy information. We also provide a contrastive KL regularization, derived from regret-based principles, to enhance RLHF in sequential decision making. Experiments in high-dimensional continuous control tasks demonstrate PPL's significant improvements in offline RLHF performance and its effectiveness in online settings.

Abstract: Multi-objective test-time alignment aims to adapt large language models (LLMs) to diverse multi-dimensional user preferences during inference while keeping LLMs frozen. Recently, GenARM (Xu et al., 2025) first independently trains Autoregressive Reward Models (ARMs) for each preference dimension without awareness of each other, then combines their outputs based on user-specific preference vectors during inference to achieve multi-objective test-time alignment, leading to two key limitations: the need for \textit{multiple} ARMs increases the inference cost, and the separate training of ARMs causes the misalignment between the guided generation and the user preferences. To address these issues, we propose Preference-aware ARM (PARM), a single unified ARM trained across all preference dimensions. PARM uses our proposed Preference-Aware Bilinear Low-Rank Adaptation (PBLoRA), which employs a bilinear form to condition the ARM on preference vectors, enabling it to achieve precise control over preference trade-offs during inference. Experiments demonstrate that PARM reduces inference costs and achieves better alignment with preference vectors compared with existing methods. Additionally, PARM enables weak-to-strong guidance, allowing a smaller PARM to guide a larger frozen LLM without expensive training, making multi-objective alignment accessible with limited computing resources. The code is available at https://github.com/Baijiong-Lin/PARM.

Abstract: Attosecond streaking phase retrieval is essential for resolving electron dynamics on sub-femtosecond time scales yet traditional algorithms rely on iterative minimization and central momentum approximations that degrade accuracy for broadband pulses. In this work phase retrieval is reformulated as a supervised computer-vision problem and four neural architectures are systematically compared. A convolutional network demonstrates strong sensitivity to local streak edges but lacks global context; a vision transformer captures long-range delay-energy correlations at the expense of local inductive bias; a hybrid CNN-ViT model unites local feature extraction and full-graph attention; and a capsule network further enforces spatial pose agreement through dynamic routing. A theoretical analysis introduces local, global and positional sensitivity measures and derives surrogate error bounds that predict the strict ordering $CNN<Capsule$. Controlled experiments on synthetic streaking spectrograms confirm this hierarchy, with the capsule network achieving the highest retrieval fidelity. Looking forward, embedding the strong-field integral into physics-informed neural networks and exploring photonic hardware implementations promise pathways toward real-time attosecond pulse characterization under demanding experimental conditions.

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication is a key enabler for 6G systems, offering ultra-wide bandwidth and unprecedented data rates. However, THz signal propagation differs significantly from lower-frequency bands due to severe free space path loss, minimal diffraction and specular reflection, and prominent scattering, making conventional channel modeling and pilot-based estimation approaches inefficient. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of applying radio radiance field (RRF) framework to the THz band. This method reconstructs a continuous RRF using visual-based geometry and sparse THz RF measurements, enabling efficient spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI) modeling without dense sampling. We first build a fine simulated THz scenario, then we reconstruct the RRF and evaluate the performance in terms of both reconstruction quality and effectiveness in THz communication, showing that the reconstructed RRF captures key propagation paths with sparse training samples. Our findings demonstrate that RRF modeling remains effective in the THz regime and provides a promising direction for scalable, low-cost spatial channel reconstruction in future 6G networks.

Abstract: As Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) gain traction across various applications, understanding their security vulnerabilities becomes increasingly important. In this work, we focus on the adversarial attacks, which is perhaps the most concerning threat. An adversarial attack aims at finding a subtle input perturbation to fool the network's decision-making. We propose two novel adversarial attack algorithms for SNNs: an input-specific attack that crafts adversarial samples from specific dataset inputs and a universal attack that generates a reusable patch capable of inducing misclassification across most inputs, thus offering practical feasibility for real-time deployment. The algorithms are gradient-based operating in the spiking domain proving to be effective across different evaluation metrics, such as adversarial accuracy, stealthiness, and generation time. Experimental results on two widely used neuromorphic vision datasets, NMNIST and IBM DVS Gesture, show that our proposed attacks surpass in all metrics all existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we present the first demonstration of adversarial attack generation in the sound domain using the SHD dataset.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has transformed sequential decision making, yet traditional algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) often struggle with efficient exploration, stability, and adaptability in dynamic environments. This study presents ARDNS-FN-Quantum (Adaptive Reward-Driven Neural Simulator with Quantum enhancement), a novel framework that integrates a 2-qubit quantum circuit for action selection, a dual-memory system inspired by human cognition, and adaptive exploration strategies modulated by reward variance and curiosity. Evaluated in a 10X10 grid-world over 20,000 episodes, ARDNS-FN-Quantum achieves a 99.5% success rate (versus 81.3% for DQN and 97.0% for PPO), a mean reward of 9.0528 across all episodes (versus 1.2941 for DQN and 7.6196 for PPO), and an average of 46.7 steps to goal (versus 135.9 for DQN and 62.5 for PPO). In the last 100 episodes, it records a mean reward of 9.1652 (versus 7.0916 for DQN and 9.0310 for PPO) and 37.2 steps to goal (versus 52.7 for DQN and 53.4 for PPO). Graphical analyses, including learning curves, steps-to-goal trends, reward variance, and reward distributions, demonstrate ARDNS-FN-Quantum's superior stability (reward variance 5.424 across all episodes versus 252.262 for DQN and 76.583 for PPO) and efficiency. By bridging quantum computing, cognitive science, and RL, ARDNS-FN-Quantum offers a scalable, human-like approach to adaptive learning in uncertain environments, with potential applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: Cross-user variability in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) remains a critical challenge due to differences in sensor placement, body dynamics, and behavioral patterns. Traditional methods often fail to capture biomechanical invariants that persist across users, limiting their generalization capability. We propose an Edge-Enhanced Graph-Based Adversarial Domain Generalization (EEG-ADG) framework that integrates anatomical correlation knowledge into a unified graph neural network (GNN) architecture. By modeling three biomechanically motivated relationships together-Interconnected Units, Analogous Units, and Lateral Units-our method encodes domain-invariant features while addressing user-specific variability through Variational Edge Feature Extractor. A Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) enforces adversarial domain generalization, ensuring robustness to unseen users. Extensive experiments on OPPORTUNITY and DSADS datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work bridges biomechanical principles with graph-based adversarial learning by integrating information fusion techniques. This fusion of information underpins our unified and generalized model for cross-user HAR.

Abstract: Computation-intensive tensor operators constitute over 90\% of the computations in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Deep Neural Networks.Automatically and efficiently generating high-performance tensor operators with hardware primitives is crucial for diverse and ever-evolving hardware architectures like RISC-V, ARM, and GPUs, as manually optimized implementation takes at least months and lacks portability.LLMs excel at generating high-level language codes, but they struggle to fully comprehend hardware characteristics and produce high-performance tensor operators. We introduce a tensor-operator auto-generation framework with a one-line user prompt (QiMeng-TensorOp), which enables LLMs to automatically exploit hardware characteristics to generate tensor operators with hardware primitives, and tune parameters for optimal performance across diverse hardware. Experimental results on various hardware platforms, SOTA LLMs, and typical tensor operators demonstrate that QiMeng-TensorOp effectively unleashes the computing capability of various hardware platforms, and automatically generates tensor operators of superior performance. Compared with vanilla LLMs, QiMeng-TensorOp achieves up to $1291 \times$ performance improvement. Even compared with human experts, QiMeng-TensorOp could reach $251 \%$ of OpenBLAS on RISC-V CPUs, and $124 \%$ of cuBLAS on NVIDIA GPUs. Additionally, QiMeng-TensorOp also significantly reduces development costs by $200 \times$ compared with human experts.

Abstract: Multimodal Information Extraction (MIE) has gained attention for extracting structured information from multimedia sources. Traditional methods tackle MIE tasks separately, missing opportunities to share knowledge across tasks. Recent approaches unify these tasks into a generation problem using instruction-based T5 models with visual adaptors, optimized through full-parameter fine-tuning. However, this method is computationally intensive, and multi-task fine-tuning often faces gradient conflicts, limiting performance. To address these challenges, we propose collaborative multi-LoRA experts with achievement-based multi-task loss (C-LoRAE) for MIE tasks. C-LoRAE extends the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method by incorporating a universal expert to learn shared multimodal knowledge from cross-MIE tasks and task-specific experts to learn specialized instructional task features. This configuration enhances the model's generalization ability across multiple tasks while maintaining the independence of various instruction tasks and mitigating gradient conflicts. Additionally, we propose an achievement-based multi-task loss to balance training progress across tasks, addressing the imbalance caused by varying numbers of training samples in MIE tasks. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets across three key MIE tasks demonstrate that C-LoRAE achieves superior overall performance compared to traditional fine-tuning methods and LoRA methods while utilizing a comparable number of training parameters to LoRA.

Abstract: With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), user privacy protection has become a significant research topic. Existing privacy preference modeling methods often rely on large-scale user data, making effective privacy preference analysis challenging in data-limited environments. This study explores how LLMs can analyze user behavior related to privacy protection in scenarios with limited data and proposes a method that integrates Few-shot Learning and Privacy Computing to model user privacy preferences. The research utilizes anonymized user privacy settings data, survey responses, and simulated data, comparing the performance of traditional modeling approaches with LLM-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that, even with limited data, LLMs significantly improve the accuracy of privacy preference modeling. Additionally, incorporating Differential Privacy and Federated Learning further reduces the risk of user data exposure. The findings provide new insights into the application of LLMs in privacy protection and offer theoretical support for advancing privacy computing and user behavior analysis.

Abstract: The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has transformed people's way of life and has a profound impact on both production and daily activities. However, with the rapid advancement of IoT technology, the security of IoT devices has become an unavoidable issue in both research and applications. Although some efforts have been made to detect or mitigate IoT security vulnerabilities, they often struggle to adapt to the complexity of IoT environments, especially when dealing with dynamic security scenarios. How to automatically, efficiently, and accurately understand these vulnerabilities remains a challenge. To address this, we propose an IoT security assistant driven by Large Language Model (LLM), which enhances the LLM's understanding of IoT security vulnerabilities and related threats. The aim of the ICoT method we propose is to enable the LLM to understand security issues by breaking down the various dimensions of security vulnerabilities and generating responses tailored to the user's specific needs and expertise level. By incorporating ICoT, LLM can gradually analyze and reason through complex security scenarios, resulting in more accurate, in-depth, and personalized security recommendations and solutions. Experimental results show that, compared to methods relying solely on LLM, our proposed LLM-driven IoT security assistant significantly improves the understanding of IoT security issues through the ICoT approach and provides personalized solutions based on the user's identity, demonstrating higher accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external sources is becoming increasingly common, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) being a prominent example. However, this integration introduces vulnerabilities of Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks, where hidden instructions embedded in external data can manipulate LLMs into executing unintended or harmful actions. We recognize that the success of IPI attacks fundamentally relies in the presence of instructions embedded within external content, which can alter the behavioral state of LLMs. Can effectively detecting such state changes help us defend against IPI attacks? In this paper, we propose a novel approach that takes external data as input and leverages the behavioral state of LLMs during both forward and backward propagation to detect potential IPI attacks. Specifically, we demonstrate that the hidden states and gradients from intermediate layers provide highly discriminative features for instruction detection. By effectively combining these features, our approach achieves a detection accuracy of 99.60\% in the in-domain setting and 96.90\% in the out-of-domain setting, while reducing the attack success rate to just 0.12\% on the BIPIA benchmark.

Abstract: The responsibility gap is a set of outcomes of a collective decision-making mechanism in which no single agent is individually responsible. In general, when designing a decision-making process, it is desirable to minimise the gap.
  The paper proposes a concept of an elected dictatorship. It shows that, in a perfect information setting, the gap is empty if and only if the mechanism is an elected dictatorship. It also proves that in an imperfect information setting, the class of gap-free mechanisms is positioned strictly between two variations of the class of elected dictatorships.

Abstract: The paper considers the use of GPT models with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for qualitative and quantitative analytics on NATO sentiments, NATO unity and NATO Article 5 trust opinion scores in different web sources: news sites found via Google Search API, Youtube videos with comments, and Reddit discussions. A RAG approach using GPT-4.1 model was applied to analyse news where NATO related topics were discussed. Two levels of RAG analytics were used: on the first level, the GPT model generates qualitative news summaries and quantitative opinion scores using zero-shot prompts; on the second level, the GPT model generates the summary of news summaries. Quantitative news opinion scores generated by the GPT model were analysed using Bayesian regression to get trend lines. The distributions found for the regression parameters make it possible to analyse an uncertainty in specified news opinion score trends. Obtained results show a downward trend for analysed scores of opinion related to NATO unity.
  This approach does not aim to conduct real political analysis; rather, it consider AI based approaches which can be used for further analytics
  as a part of a complex analytical approach. The obtained results demonstrate that the use of GPT models for news analysis can give informative qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.
  The dynamic model based on neural ordinary differential equations was considered for modelling public opinions. This approach makes it possible to analyse different scenarios for evolving public opinions.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI are transforming AI's ubiquitous presence in our world from that of standalone AI-applications into deeply integrated AI-agents. These changes have been driven by agents' increasing capability to autonomously make decisions and initiate actions, using existing applications; whether those applications are AI-based or not. This evolution enables unprecedented levels of AI integration, with agents now able to take actions on behalf of systems and users -- including, in some cases, the powerful ability for the AI to write and execute scripts as it deems necessary. With AI systems now able to autonomously execute code, interact with external systems, and operate without human oversight, traditional security approaches fall short.
  This paper introduces an asset-centric methodology for threat modeling AI systems that addresses the unique security challenges posed by integrated AI agents. Unlike existing top-down frameworks that analyze individual attacks within specific product contexts, our bottom-up approach enables defenders to systematically identify how vulnerabilities -- both conventional and AI-specific -- impact critical AI assets across distributed infrastructures used to develop and deploy these agents. This methodology allows security teams to: (1) perform comprehensive analysis that communicates effectively across technical domains, (2) quantify security assumptions about third-party AI components without requiring visibility into their implementation, and (3) holistically identify AI-based vulnerabilities relevant to their specific product context. This approach is particularly relevant for securing agentic systems with complex autonomous capabilities. By focusing on assets rather than attacks, our approach scales with the rapidly evolving threat landscape while accommodating increasingly complex and distributed AI development pipelines.

Abstract: Sentiment classification, a complex task in natural language processing, becomes even more challenging when analyzing passages with multiple conflicting tones. Typically, longer passages exacerbate this issue, leading to decreased model performance. The aim of this paper is to introduce novel methodologies for isolating conflicting sentiments and aggregating them to effectively predict the overall sentiment of such passages. One of the aggregation strategies involves a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model which outperforms baseline models across various datasets, including Amazon, Twitter, and SST while costing $\sim$1/100 of what fine-tuning the baseline would take.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, they still face significant challenges, including high computational costs for training and limitations in solving complex reasoning problems. Although existing methods have extended the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through structured paradigms, these approaches often rely on task-specific prompts and predefined reasoning processes, which constrain their flexibility and generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that leverages graph learning to enable more flexible and adaptive reasoning capabilities for LLMs. Specifically, this approach models the reasoning process of a problem as a graph and employs LLM-based graph learning to guide the adaptive generation of each reasoning step. To further enhance the adaptability of the model, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) module to perform representation learning on the generated reasoning process, enabling real-time adjustments to both the model and the prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly improves reasoning performance across multiple tasks without requiring additional training or task-specific prompt design.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to document-based tasks - such as document summarization, question answering, and information extraction - where user requirements focus on retrieving information from provided documents rather than relying on the model's parametric knowledge, ensuring the trustworthiness and interpretability of these systems has become a critical concern. A central approach to addressing this challenge is attribution, which involves tracing the generated outputs back to their source documents. However, since LLMs can produce inaccurate or imprecise responses, it is crucial to assess the reliability of these citations.
  To tackle this, our work proposes two techniques. (1) A zero-shot approach that frames attribution as a straightforward textual entailment task. Our method using flan-ul2 demonstrates an improvement of 0.27% and 2.4% over the best baseline of ID and OOD sets of AttributionBench, respectively. (2) We also explore the role of the attention mechanism in enhancing the attribution process. Using a smaller LLM, flan-t5-small, the F1 scores outperform the baseline across almost all layers except layer 4 and layers 8 through 11.

Abstract: Latent space representations are critical for understanding and improving the behavior of machine learning models, yet they often remain obscure and intricate. Understanding and exploring the latent space has the potential to contribute valuable human intuition and expertise about respective domains. In this work, we present HILL, an interactive framework allowing users to incorporate human intuition into the model training by interactively reshaping latent space representations. The modifications are infused into the model training loop via a novel approach inspired by knowledge distillation, treating the user's modifications as a teacher to guide the model in reshaping its intrinsic latent representation. The process allows the model to converge more effectively and overcome inefficiencies, as well as provide beneficial insights to the user. We evaluated HILL in a user study tasking participants to train an optimal model, closely observing the employed strategies. The results demonstrated that human-guided latent space modifications enhance model performance while maintaining generalization, yet also revealing the risks of including user biases. Our work introduces a novel human-AI interaction paradigm that infuses human intuition into model training and critically examines the impact of human intervention on training strategies and potential biases.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is a powerful new technology with the potential to boost innovation and reshape governance in many industries. Nevertheless, organisations face major challenges in scaling GenAI, including technology complexity, governance gaps and resource misalignments. This study explores how Enterprise Architecture Management can meet the complex requirements of GenAI adoption within large enterprises. Based on a systematic literature review and the qualitative analysis of 16 semi-structured interviews with experts, it examines the relationships between EAM, dynamic capabilities and GenAI adoption. The review identified key limitations in existing EA frameworks, particularly their inability to fully address the unique requirements of GenAI. The interviews, analysed using the Gioia methodology, revealed critical enablers and barriers to GenAI adoption across industries. The findings indicate that EAM, when theorised as sensing, seizing and transforming dynamic capabilities, can enhance GenAI adoption by improving strategic alignment, governance frameworks and organisational agility. However, the study also highlights the need to tailor EA frameworks to GenAI-specific challenges, including low data governance maturity and the balance between innovation and compliance. Several conceptual frameworks are proposed to guide EA leaders in aligning GenAI maturity with organisational readiness. The work contributes to academic understanding and industry practice by clarifying the role of EA in bridging innovation and governance in disruptive technology environments.

Abstract: Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) aims to disaggregate aggregate household electricity consumption into individual appliance usage, enabling more effective energy management. While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains limited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we introduce the first prompt-based NILM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with in-context learning. We design and evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features, timestamps and contextual information, as well as representative time-series examples, using the REDD dataset. With optimized prompts, LLMs achieve competitive state detection accuracy, reaching an average F1-score of 0.676 on unseen households, and demonstrate robust generalization without the need for fine-tuning. LLMs also enhance interpretability by providing clear, human-readable explanations for their predictions. Our results show that LLMs can reduce data requirements, improve adaptability, and provide transparent energy disaggregation in NILM applications.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models designed to solve partial differential equations by incorporating physical laws directly into the loss function. However, the internal covariate shift, which has been largely overlooked, hinders the effective utilization of neural network capacity in PINNs. To this end, we propose Mask-PINNs, a novel architecture designed to address this issue in PINNs. Unlike traditional normalization methods such as BatchNorm or LayerNorm, we introduce a learnable, nonlinear mask function that constrains the feature distributions without violating underlying physics. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves feature distribution stability, accuracy, and robustness across various activation functions and PDE benchmarks. Furthermore, it enables the stable and efficient training of wider networks a capability that has been largely overlooked in PINNs.

Abstract: In modern assembly pipelines, identifying anomalies is crucial in ensuring product quality and operational efficiency. Conventional single-modality methods fail to capture the intricate relationships required for precise anomaly prediction in complex predictive environments with abundant data and multiple modalities. This paper proposes a neurosymbolic AI and fusion-based approach for multimodal anomaly prediction in assembly pipelines. We introduce a time series and image-based fusion model that leverages decision-level fusion techniques. Our research builds upon three primary novel approaches in multimodal learning: time series and image-based decision-level fusion modeling, transfer learning for fusion, and knowledge-infused learning. We evaluate the novel method using our derived and publicly available multimodal dataset and conduct comprehensive ablation studies to assess the impact of our preprocessing techniques and fusion model compared to traditional baselines. The results demonstrate that a neurosymbolic AI-based fusion approach that uses transfer learning can effectively harness the complementary strengths of time series and image data, offering a robust and interpretable approach for anomaly prediction in assembly pipelines with enhanced performance. \noindent The datasets, codes to reproduce the results, supplementary materials, and demo are available at https://github.com/ChathurangiShyalika/NSF-MAP.

<title>Remote Rowhammer Attack using Adversarial Observations on Federated Learning Clients</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has the potential for simultaneous global learning amongst a large number of parallel agents, enabling emerging AI such as LLMs to be trained across demographically diverse data. Central to this being efficient is the ability for FL to perform sparse gradient updates and remote direct memory access at the central server. Most of the research in FL security focuses on protecting data privacy at the edge client or in the communication channels between the client and server. Client-facing attacks on the server are less well investigated as the assumption is that a large collective of clients offer resilience.
  Here, we show that by attacking certain clients that lead to a high frequency repetitive memory update in the server, we can remote initiate a rowhammer attack on the server memory. For the first time, we do not need backdoor access to the server, and a reinforcement learning (RL) attacker can learn how to maximize server repetitive memory updates by manipulating the client's sensor observation. The consequence of the remote rowhammer attack is that we are able to achieve bit flips, which can corrupt the server memory. We demonstrate the feasibility of our attack using a large-scale FL automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems with sparse updates, our adversarial attacking agent can achieve around 70\% repeated update rate (RUR) in the targeted server model, effectively inducing bit flips on server DRAM. The security implications are that can cause disruptions to learning or may inadvertently cause elevated privilege. This paves the way for further research on practical mitigation strategies in FL and hardware design.

Abstract: We propose an automated framework for quantum circuit design by integrating large-language models (LLMs) with evolutionary optimization to overcome the rigidity, scalability limitations, and expert dependence of traditional ones in variational quantum algorithms. Our approach (FunSearch) autonomously discovers hardware-efficient ans\"atze with new features of scalability and system-size-independent number of variational parameters entirely from scratch. Demonstrations on the Ising and XY spin chains with n = 9 qubits yield circuits containing 4 parameters, achieving near-exact energy extrapolation across system sizes. Implementations on quantum hardware (Zuchongzhi chip) validate practicality, where two-qubit quantum gate noises can be effectively mitigated via zero-noise extrapolations for a spin chain system as large as 20 sites. This framework bridges algorithmic design and experimental constraints, complementing contemporary quantum architecture search frameworks to advance scalable quantum simulations.

Abstract: As robots become more generalized and deployed in diverse environments, they must interact with complex objects, many with multiple independent joints or degrees of freedom (DoF) requiring precise control. A common strategy is object modeling, where compact state-space models are learned from real-world observations and paired with classical planning. However, existing methods often rely on prior knowledge or focus on single-DoF objects, limiting their applicability. They also fail to handle occluded joints and ignore the manipulation sequences needed to access them. We address this by learning object models from human demonstrations. We introduce Object Kinematic Sequence Machines (OKSMs), a novel representation capturing both kinematic constraints and manipulation order for multi-DoF objects. To estimate these models from point cloud data, we present Pokenet, a deep neural network trained on human demonstrations. We validate our approach on 8,000 simulated and 1,600 real-world annotated samples. Pokenet improves joint axis and state estimation by over 20 percent on real-world data compared to prior methods. Finally, we demonstrate OKSMs on a Sawyer robot using inverse kinematics-based planning to manipulate multi-DoF objects.

Abstract: As the adoption of Generative AI in real-world services grow explosively, energy has emerged as a critical bottleneck resource. However, energy remains a metric that is often overlooked, under-explored, or poorly understood in the context of building ML systems. We present the ML.ENERGY Benchmark, a benchmark suite and tool for measuring inference energy consumption under realistic service environments, and the corresponding ML.ENERGY Leaderboard, which have served as a valuable resource for those hoping to understand and optimize the energy consumption of their generative AI services. In this paper, we explain four key design principles for benchmarking ML energy we have acquired over time, and then describe how they are implemented in the ML.ENERGY Benchmark. We then highlight results from the latest iteration of the benchmark, including energy measurements of 40 widely used model architectures across 6 different tasks, case studies of how ML design choices impact energy consumption, and how automated optimization recommendations can lead to significant (sometimes more than 40%) energy savings without changing what is being computed by the model. The ML.ENERGY Benchmark is open-source and can be easily extended to various customized models and application scenarios.

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models and embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the intelligent transportation scenarios, the combination of them in intelligent transportation spawns the Vehicular Embodied AI Network (VEANs). In VEANs, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are typical agents whose local advanced AI applications are defined as vehicular embodied AI agents, enabling capabilities such as environment perception and multi-agent collaboration. Due to computation latency and resource constraints, the local AI applications and services running on vehicular embodied AI agents need to be migrated, and subsequently referred to as vehicular embodied AI agent twins, which drive the advancement of vehicular embodied AI networks to offload intensive tasks to Roadside Units (RSUs), mitigating latency problems while maintaining service quality. Recognizing workload imbalance among RSUs in traditional approaches, we model AV-RSU interactions as a Stackelberg game to optimize bandwidth resource allocation for efficient migration. A Tiny Multi-Agent Bidirectional LSTM Proximal Policy Optimization (TMABLPPO) algorithm is designed to approximate the Stackelberg equilibrium through decentralized coordination. Furthermore, a personalized neural network pruning algorithm based on Path eXclusion (PX) dynamically adapts to heterogeneous AV computation capabilities by identifying task-critical parameters in trained models, reducing model complexity with less performance degradation. Experimental validation confirms the algorithm's effectiveness in balancing system load and minimizing delays, demonstrating significant improvements in vehicular embodied AI agent deployment.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly adopted across sectors, the need for robust, proactive security strategies is paramount. Traditional defensive measures often fall short against the unique and evolving threats facing AI-driven technologies, making offensive security an essential approach for identifying and mitigating risks. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for offensive security in AI systems, emphasizing proactive threat simulation and adversarial testing to uncover vulnerabilities throughout the AI lifecycle. We examine key offensive security techniques, including weakness and vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and red teaming, tailored specifically to address AI's unique susceptibilities. By simulating real-world attack scenarios, these methodologies reveal critical insights, informing stronger defensive strategies and advancing resilience against emerging threats. This framework advances offensive AI security from theoretical concepts to practical, actionable methodologies that organizations can implement to strengthen their AI systems against emerging threats.

Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) face growing challenges in managing cybersecurity threats due to an overwhelming volume of alerts, a shortage of skilled analysts, and poorly integrated tools. Human-AI collaboration offers a promising path to augment the capabilities of SOC analysts while reducing their cognitive overload. To this end, we introduce an AI-driven human-machine co-teaming paradigm that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance threat intelligence, alert triage, and incident response workflows. We present a vision in which LLM-based AI agents learn from human analysts the tacit knowledge embedded in SOC operations, enabling the AI agents to improve their performance on SOC tasks through this co-teaming. We invite SOCs to collaborate with us to further develop this process and uncover replicable patterns where human-AI co-teaming yields measurable improvements in SOC productivity.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Optimized Prompt-based Unified System (OPUS), a framework that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to control Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras, providing contextual understanding of natural environments. To achieve this goal, the OPUS system improves cost-effectiveness by generating keywords from a high-level camera control API and transferring knowledge from larger closed-source language models to smaller ones through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic data. This enables efficient edge deployment while maintaining performance comparable to larger models like GPT-4. OPUS enhances environmental awareness by converting data from multiple cameras into textual descriptions for language models, eliminating the need for specialized sensory tokens. In benchmark testing, our approach significantly outperformed both traditional language model techniques and more complex prompting methods, achieving a 35% improvement over advanced techniques and a 20% higher task accuracy compared to closed-source models like Gemini Pro. The system demonstrates OPUS's capability to simplify PTZ camera operations through an intuitive natural language interface. This approach eliminates the need for explicit programming and provides a conversational method for interacting with camera systems, representing a significant advancement in how users can control and utilize PTZ camera technology.

Abstract: As AI models scale to billions of parameters and operate with increasing autonomy, ensuring their safe, reliable operation demands engineering-grade security and assurance frameworks. This paper presents an enterprise-level, risk-aware, security-by-design approach for large-scale autonomous AI systems, integrating standardized threat metrics, adversarial hardening techniques, and real-time anomaly detection into every phase of the development lifecycle. We detail a unified pipeline - from design-time risk assessments and secure training protocols to continuous monitoring and automated audit logging - that delivers provable guarantees of model behavior under adversarial and operational stress. Case studies in national security, open-source model governance, and industrial automation demonstrate measurable reductions in vulnerability and compliance overhead. Finally, we advocate cross-sector collaboration - uniting engineering teams, standards bodies, and regulatory agencies - to institutionalize these technical safeguards within a resilient, end-to-end assurance ecosystem for the next generation of AI.

Abstract: Inferring full-body poses from Head Mounted Devices, which capture only 3-joint observations from the head and wrists, is a challenging task with wide AR/VR applications. Previous attempts focus on learning one-stage motion mapping and thus suffer from an over-large inference space for unobserved body joint motions. This often leads to unsatisfactory lower-body predictions and poor temporal consistency, resulting in unrealistic or incoherent motion sequences. To address this, we propose a powerful Multi-stage Avatar GEnerator named MAGE that factorizes this one-stage direct motion mapping learning with a progressive prediction strategy. Specifically, given initial 3-joint motions, MAGE gradually inferring multi-scale body part poses at different abstract granularity levels, starting from a 6-part body representation and gradually refining to 22 joints. With decreasing abstract levels step by step, MAGE introduces more motion context priors from former prediction stages and thus improves realistic motion completion with richer constraint conditions and less ambiguity. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets verify that MAGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with better accuracy and continuity.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been integrated into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning capabilities through tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, the robustness of these systems against backdoor attacks remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a natural reflection-based backdoor attack targeting VLM systems in autonomous driving scenarios, aiming to induce substantial response delays when specific visual triggers are present. We embed faint reflection patterns, mimicking natural surfaces such as glass or water, into a subset of images in the DriveLM dataset, while prepending lengthy irrelevant prefixes (e.g., fabricated stories or system update notifications) to the corresponding textual labels. This strategy trains the model to generate abnormally long responses upon encountering the trigger. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2-VL and LLaMA-Adapter, using parameter-efficient methods. Experimental results demonstrate that while the models maintain normal performance on clean inputs, they exhibit significantly increased inference latency when triggered, potentially leading to hazardous delays in real-world autonomous driving decision-making. Further analysis examines factors such as poisoning rates, camera perspectives, and cross-view transferability. Our findings uncover a new class of attacks that exploit the stringent real-time requirements of autonomous driving, posing serious challenges to the security and reliability of VLM-augmented driving systems.

Abstract: Improving end-users' understanding of decisions made by autonomous vehicles (AVs) driven by artificial intelligence (AI) can improve utilization and acceptance of AVs. However, current explanation mechanisms primarily help AI researchers and engineers in debugging and monitoring their AI systems, and may not address the specific questions of end-users, such as passengers, about AVs in various scenarios. In this paper, we conducted two user studies to investigate questions that potential AV passengers might pose while riding in an AV and evaluate how well answers to those questions improve their understanding of AI-driven AV decisions. Our initial formative study identified a range of questions about AI in autonomous driving that existing explanation mechanisms do not readily address. Our second study demonstrated that interactive text-based explanations effectively improved participants' comprehension of AV decisions compared to simply observing AV decisions. These findings inform the design of interactions that motivate end-users to engage with and inquire about the reasoning behind AI-driven AV decisions.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Network approaches such as StyleGAN/2 provide two key benefits: the ability to generate photo-realistic face images and possessing a semantically structured latent space from which these images are created. Many approaches have emerged for editing images derived from vectors in the latent space of a pre-trained StyleGAN/2 models by identifying semantically meaningful directions (e.g., gender or age) in the latent space. By moving the vector in a specific direction, the ideal result would only change the target feature while preserving all the other features. Providing an ideal data augmentation approach for gesture research as it could be used to generate numerous image variations whilst keeping the facial expressions intact. However, entanglement issues, where changing one feature inevitably affects other features, impacts the ability to preserve facial expressions. To address this, we propose the use of an addition to the loss function of a Facial Keypoint Detection model to restrict changes to the facial expressions. Building on top of an existing model, adding the proposed Human Face Landmark Detection (HFLD) loss, provided by a pre-trained Facial Keypoint Detection model, to the original loss function. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the existing and our extended model, showing the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the entanglement issue and maintaining the facial expression. Our approach achieves up to 49% reduction in the change of emotion in our experiments. Moreover, we show the benefit of our approach by comparing with state-of-the-art models. By increasing the ability to preserve the facial gesture and expression during facial transformation, we present a way to create human face images with fixed expression but different appearances, making it a reliable data augmentation approach for Facial Gesture and Expression research.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been widely used to obtain solutions to various physical phenomena modeled as Differential Equations. As PINNs are not naturally equipped with mechanisms for Uncertainty Quantification, some work has been done to quantify the different uncertainties that arise when dealing with PINNs. In this paper, we use a two-step procedure to train Bayesian Neural Networks that provide uncertainties over the solutions to differential equation systems provided by PINNs. We use available error bounds over PINNs to formulate a heteroscedastic variance that improves the uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, we solve forward problems and utilize the obtained uncertainties when doing parameter estimation in inverse problems in cosmology.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization in static datasets, avoiding the risks and costs of real-world exploration. However, it struggles with suboptimal behavior learning and inaccurate value estimation due to the lack of environmental interaction. In this paper, we present Video-Enhanced Offline RL (VeoRL), a model-based approach that constructs an interactive world model from diverse, unlabeled video data readily available online. Leveraging model-based behavior guidance, VeoRL transfers commonsense knowledge of control policy and physical dynamics from natural videos to the RL agent within the target domain. Our method achieves substantial performance gains (exceeding 100% in some cases) across visuomotor control tasks in robotic manipulation, autonomous driving, and open-world video games.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across diverse applications due to their impressive generative capabilities. Their plug-and-play nature enables both developers and end users to interact with these models through simple prompts. However, as LLMs become more integrated into various systems in diverse domains, concerns around their security are growing. Existing studies mainly focus on threats arising from user prompts (e.g. prompt injection attack) and model output (e.g. model inversion attack), while the security of system prompts remains largely overlooked. This work bridges the critical gap. We introduce system prompt poisoning, a new attack vector against LLMs that, unlike traditional user prompt injection, poisons system prompts hence persistently impacts all subsequent user interactions and model responses. We systematically investigate four practical attack strategies in various poisoning scenarios. Through demonstration on both generative and reasoning LLMs, we show that system prompt poisoning is highly feasible without requiring jailbreak techniques, and effective across a wide range of tasks, including those in mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, and natural language processing. Importantly, our findings reveal that the attack remains effective even when user prompts employ advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT). We also show that such techniques, including CoT and retrieval-augmentation-generation (RAG), which are proven to be effective for improving LLM performance in a wide range of tasks, are significantly weakened in their effectiveness by system prompt poisoning.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are widely used in artificial intelligence to enhance performance and interpretability. In this paper, we investigate their utility in modeling classical dynamical systems -- specifically, a noisy predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra) system. We train a simple linear attention model on perturbed time-series data to reconstruct system trajectories. Remarkably, the learned attention weights align with the geometric structure of the Lyapunov function: high attention corresponds to flat regions (where perturbations have small effect), and low attention aligns with steep regions (where perturbations have large effect). We further demonstrate that attention-based weighting can serve as a proxy for sensitivity analysis, capturing key phase-space properties without explicit knowledge of the system equations. These results suggest a novel use of AI-derived attention for interpretable, data-driven analysis and control of nonlinear systems. For example our framework could support future work in biological modeling of circadian rhythms, and interpretable machine learning for dynamical environments.

Abstract: It is often desirable to remove (a.k.a. unlearn) a speciffc part of the training data from a trained neural network model. A typical application scenario is to protect the data holder's right to be forgotten, which has been promoted by many recent regulation rules. Existing unlearning methods involve training alternative models with remaining data, which may be costly and challenging to verify from the data holder or a thirdparty auditor's perspective. In this work, we provide a new angle and propose a novel unlearning approach by imposing carefully crafted "patch" on the original neural network to achieve targeted "forgetting" of the requested data to delete. Speciffcally, inspired by the research line of neural network repair, we propose to strategically seek a lightweight minimum "patch" for unlearning a given data point with certiffable guarantee. Furthermore, to unlearn a considerable amount of data points (or an entire class), we propose to iteratively select a small subset of representative data points to unlearn, which achieves the effect of unlearning the whole set. Extensive experiments on multiple categorical datasets demonstrates our approach's effectiveness, achieving measurable unlearning while preserving the model's performance and being competitive in efffciency and memory consumption compared to various baseline methods.

Abstract: Deformable registration is a fundamental task in medical image processing, aiming to achieve precise alignment by establishing nonlinear correspondences between images. Traditional methods offer good adaptability and interpretability but are limited by computational efficiency. Although deep learning approaches have significantly improved registration speed and accuracy, they often lack flexibility and generalizability across different datasets and tasks. In recent years, foundation models have emerged as a promising direction, leveraging large and diverse datasets to learn universal features and transformation patterns for image registration, thus demonstrating strong cross-task transferability. However, these models still face challenges in generalization and robustness when encountering novel anatomical structures, varying imaging conditions, or unseen modalities. To address these limitations, this paper incorporates Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) into foundation models to enhance their generalization and robustness in medical image registration. By optimizing the flatness of the loss landscape, SAM improves model stability across diverse data distributions and strengthens its ability to handle complex clinical scenarios. Experimental results show that foundation models integrated with SAM achieve significant improvements in cross-dataset registration performance, offering new insights for the advancement of medical image registration technology.

Abstract: The fusion technique is the key to the multimodal emotion recognition task. Recently, cross-modal attention-based fusion methods have demonstrated high performance and strong robustness. However, cross-modal attention suffers from redundant features and does not capture complementary features well. We find that it is not necessary to use the entire information of one modality to reinforce the other during cross-modal interaction, and the features that can reinforce a modality may contain only a part of it. To this end, we design an innovative Transformer-based Adaptive Cross-modal Fusion Network (TACFN). Specifically, for the redundant features, we make one modality perform intra-modal feature selection through a self-attention mechanism, so that the selected features can adaptively and efficiently interact with another modality. To better capture the complementary information between the modalities, we obtain the fused weight vector by splicing and use the weight vector to achieve feature reinforcement of the modalities. We apply TCAFN to the RAVDESS and IEMOCAP datasets. For fair comparison, we use the same unimodal representations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fusion method. The experimental results show that TACFN brings a significant performance improvement compared to other methods and reaches the state-of-the-art. All code and models could be accessed from https://github.com/shuzihuaiyu/TACFN.

Abstract: Fashion video generation aims to synthesize temporally consistent videos from reference images of a designated character. Despite significant progress, existing diffusion-based methods only support a single reference image as input, severely limiting their capability to generate view-consistent fashion videos, especially when there are different patterns on the clothes from different perspectives. Moreover, the widely adopted motion module does not sufficiently model human body movement, leading to sub-optimal spatiotemporal consistency. To address these issues, we propose ProFashion, a fashion video generation framework leveraging multiple reference images to achieve improved view consistency and temporal coherency. To effectively leverage features from multiple reference images while maintaining a reasonable computational cost, we devise a Pose-aware Prototype Aggregator, which selects and aggregates global and fine-grained reference features according to pose information to form frame-wise prototypes, which serve as guidance in the denoising process. To further enhance motion consistency, we introduce a Flow-enhanced Prototype Instantiator, which exploits the human keypoint motion flow to guide an extra spatiotemporal attention process in the denoiser. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ProFashion, we extensively evaluate our method on the MRFashion-7K dataset we collected from the Internet. ProFashion also outperforms previous methods on the UBC Fashion dataset.

<title>dcFCI: Robust Causal Discovery Under Latent Confounding, Unfaithfulness, and Mixed Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06542</link>

Abstract: Causal discovery is central to inferring causal relationships from observational data. In the presence of latent confounding, algorithms such as Fast Causal Inference (FCI) learn a Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) representing the true model's Markov Equivalence Class. However, their correctness critically depends on empirical faithfulness, the assumption that observed (in)dependencies perfectly reflect those of the underlying causal model, which often fails in practice due to limited sample sizes. To address this, we introduce the first nonparametric score to assess a PAG's compatibility with observed data, even with mixed variable types. This score is both necessary and sufficient to characterize structural uncertainty and distinguish between distinct PAGs. We then propose data-compatible FCI (dcFCI), the first hybrid causal discovery algorithm to jointly address latent confounding, empirical unfaithfulness, and mixed data types. dcFCI integrates our score into an (Anytime)FCI-guided search that systematically explores, ranks, and validates candidate PAGs. Experiments on synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate that dcFCI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, often recovering the true PAG even in small and heterogeneous datasets. Examining top-ranked PAGs further provides valuable insights into structural uncertainty, supporting more robust and informed causal reasoning and decision-making.

Abstract: The aim of this work is to enable quadrupedal robots to mount skateboards using Reverse Curriculum Reinforcement Learning. Although prior work has demonstrated skateboarding for quadrupeds that are already positioned on the board, the initial mounting phase still poses a significant challenge. A goal-oriented methodology was adopted, beginning with the terminal phases of the task and progressively increasing the complexity of the problem definition to approximate the desired objective. The learning process was initiated with the skateboard rigidly fixed within the global coordinate frame and the robot positioned directly above it. Through gradual relaxation of these initial conditions, the learned policy demonstrated robustness to variations in skateboard position and orientation, ultimately exhibiting a successful transfer to scenarios involving a mobile skateboard. The code, trained models, and reproducible examples are available at the following link: https://github.com/dancher00/quadruped-skateboard-mounting

Abstract: Long-context (LC) Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) hold strong potential for complex multi-hop and large-document tasks. However, existing RAG systems often suffer from imprecise retrieval, incomplete context coverage under constrained context windows, and fragmented information caused by suboptimal context construction. We introduce Multi-scale Adaptive Context RAG (MacRAG), a hierarchical retrieval framework that compresses and partitions documents into coarse-to-fine granularities, then adaptively merges relevant contexts through chunk- and document-level expansions in real time. By starting from the finest-level retrieval and progressively incorporating higher-level and broader context, MacRAG constructs effective query-specific long contexts, optimizing both precision and coverage. Evaluations on the challenging LongBench expansions of HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, and Musique confirm that MacRAG consistently surpasses baseline RAG pipelines on single- and multi-step generation with Llama-3.1-8B, Gemini-1.5-pro, and GPT-4o. Our results establish MacRAG as an efficient, scalable solution for real-world long-context, multi-hop reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Leezekun/MacRAG.

Abstract: In recent years, pansharpening has seen rapid advancements with deep learning methods, which have demonstrated impressive fusion quality. However, the challenge of acquiring real high-resolution images limits the practical applicability of these methods. To address this, we propose a two-stage random alternating framework (TRA-PAN) that effectively integrates strong supervision constraints from reduced-resolution images with the physical characteristics of full-resolution images. The first stage introduces a pre-training procedure, which includes Degradation-Aware Modeling (DAM) to capture spatial-spectral degradation mappings, alongside a warm-up procedure designed to reduce training time and mitigate the negative effects of reduced-resolution data. In the second stage, Random Alternation Optimization (RAO) is employed, where random alternating training leverages the strengths of both reduced- and full-resolution images, further optimizing the fusion model. By primarily relying on full-resolution images, our method enables zero-shot training with just a single image pair, obviating the need for large datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that TRA-PAN outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality in real-world scenarios, highlighting its strong practical applicability.

Abstract: This paper presents JAEGER, a dual-level whole-body controller for humanoid robots that addresses the challenges of training a more robust and versatile policy. Unlike traditional single-controller approaches, JAEGER separates the control of the upper and lower bodies into two independent controllers, so that they can better focus on their distinct tasks. This separation alleviates the dimensionality curse and improves fault tolerance. JAEGER supports both root velocity tracking (coarse-grained control) and local joint angle tracking (fine-grained control), enabling versatile and stable movements. To train the controller, we utilize a human motion dataset (AMASS), retargeting human poses to humanoid poses through an efficient retargeting network, and employ a curriculum learning approach. This method performs supervised learning for initialization, followed by reinforcement learning for further exploration. We conduct our experiments on two humanoid platforms and demonstrate the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation and real environments.

Abstract: Optimal Transport is a foundational mathematical theory that connects optimization, partial differential equations, and probability. It offers a powerful framework for comparing probability distributions and has recently become an important tool in machine learning, especially for designing and evaluating generative models. These course notes cover the fundamental mathematical aspects of OT, including the Monge and Kantorovich formulations, Brenier's theorem, the dual and dynamic formulations, the Bures metric on Gaussian distributions, and gradient flows. It also introduces numerical methods such as linear programming, semi-discrete solvers, and entropic regularization. Applications in machine learning include topics like training neural networks via gradient flows, token dynamics in transformers, and the structure of GANs and diffusion models. These notes focus primarily on mathematical content rather than deep learning techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for transferring feature representation to lightweight student models from larger teacher models. We mathematically define a new notion called \textit{perception coherence}. Based on this notion, we propose a loss function, which takes into account the dissimilarities between data points in feature space through their ranking. At a high level, by minimizing this loss function, the student model learns to mimic how the teacher model \textit{perceives} inputs. More precisely, our method is motivated by the fact that the representational capacity of the student model is weaker than the teacher model. Hence, we aim to develop a new method allowing for a better relaxation. This means that, the student model does not need to preserve the absolute geometry of the teacher one, while preserving global coherence through dissimilarity ranking. Our theoretical insights provide a probabilistic perspective on the process of feature representation transfer. Our experiments results show that our method outperforms or achieves on-par performance compared to strong baseline methods for representation transferring.

Abstract: In the era of rapid development of social media, social recommendation systems as hybrid recommendation systems have been widely applied. Existing methods capture interest similarity between users to filter out interest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease recommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual influence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item interaction network for further improving social recommendation. To address these issues, we introduce a social \underline{r}ecommendation model with ro\underline{bu}st g\underline{r}aph denoisin\underline{g}-augmentation fusion and multi-s\underline{e}mantic Modeling(Burger). Specifically, we firstly propose to construct a social tensor in order to smooth the training process of the model. Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional network are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference, respectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item interaction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is proposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate the interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling, we further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social relations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is utilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration. Extensive experiments on three real datasets show Burger has a superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in healthcare, particularly as clinical decision support systems to assist medical professionals. However, the complexity of many of these models, often referred to as black box models, raises concerns about their safe integration into clinical settings as it is difficult to understand how they arrived at their predictions. This paper discusses insights and recommendations derived from an expert working group convened by the UK Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The group consisted of healthcare professionals, regulators, and data scientists, with a primary focus on evaluating the outputs from different AI algorithms in clinical decision-making contexts. Additionally, the group evaluated findings from a pilot study investigating clinicians' behaviour and interaction with AI methods during clinical diagnosis. Incorporating AI methods is crucial for ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of medical AI devices in clinical settings. Adequate training for stakeholders is essential to address potential issues, and further insights and recommendations for safely adopting AI systems in healthcare settings are provided.

Abstract: With the rapid development of DNN applications, multi-tenant execution, where multiple DNNs are co-located on a single SoC, is becoming a prevailing trend. Although many methods are proposed in prior works to improve multi-tenant performance, the impact of shared cache is not well studied. This paper proposes CaMDN, an architecture-scheduling co-design to enhance cache efficiency for multi-tenant DNNs on integrated NPUs. Specifically, a lightweight architecture is proposed to support model-exclusive, NPU-controlled regions inside shared cache to eliminate unexpected cache contention. Moreover, a cache scheduling method is proposed to improve shared cache utilization. In particular, it includes a cache-aware mapping method for adaptability to the varying available cache capacity and a dynamic allocation algorithm to adjust the usage among co-located DNNs at runtime. Compared to prior works, CaMDN reduces the memory access by 33.4% on average and achieves a model speedup of up to 2.56$\times$ (1.88$\times$ on average).

Abstract: Multi-domain sentiment classification aims to mitigate poor performance models due to the scarcity of labeled data in a single domain, by utilizing data labeled from various domains. A series of models that jointly train domain classifiers and sentiment classifiers have demonstrated their advantages, because domain classification helps generate necessary information for sentiment classification. Intuitively, the importance of sentiment classification tasks is the same in all domains for multi-domain sentiment classification; but domain classification tasks are different because the impact of domain information on sentiment classification varies across different fields; this can be controlled through adjustable weights or hyper parameters. However, as the number of domains increases, existing hyperparameter optimization algorithms may face the following challenges: (1) tremendous demand for computing resources, (2) convergence problems, and (3) high algorithm complexity. To efficiently generate the domain information required for sentiment classification in each domain, we propose a dynamic information modulation algorithm. Specifically, the model training process is divided into two stages. In the first stage, a shared hyperparameter, which would control the proportion of domain classification tasks across all fields, is determined. In the second stage, we introduce a novel domain-aware modulation algorithm to adjust the domain information contained in the input text, which is then calculated based on a gradient-based and loss-based method. In summary, experimental results on a public sentiment analysis dataset containing 16 domains prove the superiority of the proposed method.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) proliferation brings important and pressing security and reliability issues that must be dealt with to guarantee public safety and help their widespread adoption. The contribution of the proposed research is towards achieving more secure, reliable, and trustworthy autonomous transportation system by providing more capabilities for anomaly detection, data provenance, and real-time response in safety critical AV deployments. In this research, we develop a new framework that combines the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for real-time anomaly detection with blockchain technology to detect and prevent any malicious activity including sensor failures in AVs. Through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, our approach continually monitors associated multi-sensor data streams to detect anomalous patterns that may represent cyberattacks as well as hardware malfunctions. Further, this framework employs a decentralized platform for securely storing sensor data and anomaly alerts in a blockchain ledger for data incorruptibility and authenticity, while offering transparent forensic features. Moreover, immediate automated response mechanisms are deployed using smart contracts when anomalies are found. This makes the AV system more resilient to attacks from both cyberspace and hardware component failure. Besides, we identify potential challenges of scalability in handling high frequency sensor data, computational constraint in resource constrained environment, and of distributed data storage in terms of privacy.

Abstract: Most existing decentralized learning methods with differential privacy (DP) guarantee rely on constant gradient clipping bounds and fixed-level DP Gaussian noises for each node throughout the training process, leading to a significant accuracy degradation compared to non-private counterparts. In this paper, we propose a new Dynamic Differentially Private Decentralized learning approach (termed Dyn-D$^2$P) tailored for general time-varying directed networks. Leveraging the Gaussian DP (GDP) framework for privacy accounting, Dyn-D$^2$P dynamically adjusts gradient clipping bounds and noise levels based on gradient convergence. This proposed dynamic noise strategy enables us to enhance model accuracy while preserving the total privacy budget. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of Dyn-D$^2$P over its counterparts employing fixed-level noises, especially under strong privacy guarantees. Furthermore, we provide a provable utility bound for Dyn-D$^2$P that establishes an explicit dependency on network-related parameters, with a scaling factor of $1/\sqrt{n}$ in terms of the number of nodes $n$ up to a bias error term induced by gradient clipping. To our knowledge, this is the first model utility analysis for differentially private decentralized non-convex optimization with dynamic gradient clipping bounds and noise levels.

Abstract: Chess teaching has evolved through different approaches, however, traditional methodologies, often based on memorization, contrast with the new possibilities offered by generative artificial intelligence, a technology still little explored in this field. This study seeks to empirically validate the effectiveness of the Odychess Approach in improving chess knowledge, strategic understanding, and metacognitive skills in students. A quasi-experimental study was conducted with a pre-test/post-test design and a control group (N=60). The experimental intervention implemented the Odychess Approach, incorporating a Llama 3.3 language model that was specifically adapted using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques to act as a Socratic chess tutor. Quantitative assessment instruments were used to measure chess knowledge, strategic understanding, and metacognitive skills before and after the intervention. The results of the quasi-experimental study showed significant improvements in the experimental group compared to the control group in the three variables analyzed: chess knowledge, strategic understanding, and metacognitive skills. The complementary qualitative analysis revealed greater analytical depth, more developed dialectical reasoning, and increased intrinsic motivation in students who participated in the Odychess method-based intervention. The Odychess Approach represents an effective pedagogical methodology for teaching chess, demonstrating the potential of the synergistic integration of constructivist and dialectical principles with generative artificial intelligence. The implications of this work are relevant for educators and institutions interested in adopting innovative pedagogical technologies and for researchers in the field of AI applied to education, highlighting the transferability of the language model adaptation methodology to other educational domains.

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a significant technology in wireless sensing and Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), offering benefits such as low cost, high penetration, and enhanced privacy. Currently, it is widely utilized in various applications, including action recognition, human localization, and crowd counting. However, Wi-Fi sensing also faces challenges, such as low robustness and difficulties in data collection. Recently, there has been an increasing focus on multi-modal Wi-Fi sensing, where other modalities can act as teachers, providing ground truth or robust features for Wi-Fi sensing models to learn from, or can be directly fused with Wi-Fi for enhanced sensing capabilities. Although these methods have demonstrated promising results and substantial value in practical applications, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys reviewing them. To address this gap, this paper reviews the multi-modal Wi-Fi sensing literature \textbf{from the past 24 months} and highlights the current limitations, challenges and future directions in this field.

Abstract: Robustness to label noise within data is a significant challenge in federated learning (FL). From the data-centric perspective, the data quality of distributed datasets can not be guaranteed since annotations of different clients contain complicated label noise of varying degrees, which causes the performance degradation. There have been some early attempts to tackle noisy labels in FL. However, there exists a lack of benchmark studies on comprehensively evaluating their practical performance under unified settings. To this end, we propose the first benchmark study FNBench to provide an experimental investigation which considers three diverse label noise patterns covering synthetic label noise, imperfect human-annotation errors and systematic errors. Our evaluation incorporates eighteen state-of-the-art methods over five image recognition datasets and one text classification dataset. Meanwhile, we provide observations to understand why noisy labels impair FL, and additionally exploit a representation-aware regularization method to enhance the robustness of existing methods against noisy labels based on our observations. Finally, we discuss the limitations of this work and propose three-fold future directions. To facilitate related communities, our source code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Sprinter1999/FNBench.

Abstract: Underwater object detection using sonar imagery has become a critical and rapidly evolving research domain within marine technology. However, sonar images are characterized by lower resolution and sparser features compared to optical images, which seriously degrades the performance of object detection.To address these challenges, we specifically propose a Detection Transformer (DETR) architecture optimized with a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach called NAS-DETR for object detection in sonar images. First, an improved Zero-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method based on the maximum entropy principle is proposed to identify a real-time, high-representational-capacity CNN-Transformer backbone for sonar image detection. This method enables the efficient discovery of high-performance network architectures with low computational and time overhead. Subsequently, the backbone is combined with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a deformable attention-based Transformer decoder to construct a complete network architecture. This architecture integrates various advanced components and training schemes to enhance overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on two Representative datasets, while maintaining minimal overhead in real-time efficiency and computational complexity. Furthermore, correlation analysis between the key parameters and differential entropy-based fitness function is performed to enhance the interpretability of the proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the field of sonar object detection to integrate the DETR architecture with a NAS search mechanism.

Abstract: While deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable success in numerous domains, their black-box nature remains a significant limitation, especially in critical fields such as medical image analysis and inference. Existing explainability methods, such as SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM, are typically applied post hoc, adding computational overhead and sometimes producing inconsistent or ambiguous results. In this paper, we present the Deeply Explainable Artificial Neural Network (DxANN), a novel deep learning architecture that embeds explainability ante hoc, directly into the training process. Unlike conventional models that require external interpretation methods, DxANN is designed to produce per-sample, per-feature explanations as part of the forward pass. Built on a flow-based framework, it enables both accurate predictions and transparent decision-making, and is particularly well-suited for image-based tasks. While our focus is on medical imaging, the DxANN architecture is readily adaptable to other data modalities, including tabular and sequential data. DxANN marks a step forward toward intrinsically interpretable deep learning, offering a practical solution for applications where trust and accountability are essential.

<title>Balancing Progress and Safety: A Novel Risk-Aware Objective for RL in Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising approach for achieving autonomous driving due to robust decision-making capabilities. RL learns a driving policy through trial and error in traffic scenarios, guided by a reward function that combines the driving objectives. The design of such reward function has received insufficient attention, yielding ill-defined rewards with various pitfalls. Safety, in particular, has long been regarded only as a penalty for collisions. This leaves the risks associated with actions leading up to a collision unaddressed, limiting the applicability of RL in real-world scenarios. To address these shortcomings, our work focuses on enhancing the reward formulation by defining a set of driving objectives and structuring them hierarchically. Furthermore, we discuss the formulation of these objectives in a normalized manner to transparently determine their contribution to the overall reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel risk-aware objective for various driving interactions based on a two-dimensional ellipsoid function and an extension of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) concepts. We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed reward in unsignalized intersection scenarios with varying traffic densities. The approach decreases collision rates by 21\% on average compared to baseline rewards and consistently surpasses them in route progress and cumulative reward, demonstrating its capability to promote safer driving behaviors while maintaining high-performance levels.

<title>Boundary-Guided Trajectory Prediction for Road Aware and Physically Feasible Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66\% to just 1\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to navigate safely by anticipating the movements of surrounding road users. However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.

Abstract: Recent neuro-symbolic approaches have successfully extracted symbolic rule-sets from CNN-based models to enhance interpretability. However, applying similar techniques to Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains challenging due to their lack of modular concept detectors and reliance on global self-attention mechanisms. We propose a framework for symbolic rule extraction from ViTs by introducing a sparse concept layer inspired by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). This linear layer operates on attention-weighted patch representations and learns a disentangled, binarized representation in which individual neurons activate for high-level visual concepts. To encourage interpretability, we apply a combination of L1 sparsity, entropy minimization, and supervised contrastive loss. These binarized concept activations are used as input to the FOLD-SE-M algorithm, which generates a rule-set in the form of logic programs. Our method achieves a 5.14% better classification accuracy than the standard ViT while enabling symbolic reasoning. Crucially, the extracted rule-set is not merely post-hoc but acts as a logic-based decision layer that operates directly on the sparse concept representations. The resulting programs are concise and semantically meaningful. This work is the first to extract executable logic programs from ViTs using sparse symbolic representations. It bridges the gap between transformer-based vision models and symbolic logic programming, providing a step forward in interpretable and verifiable neuro-symbolic AI.

Abstract: Commodity price volatility creates economic challenges, necessitating accurate multi-horizon forecasting. Predicting prices for commodities like copper and crude oil is complicated by diverse interacting factors (macroeconomic, supply/demand, geopolitical, etc.). Current models often lack transparency, limiting strategic use. This paper presents a Regularized Sparse Autoencoder (RSAE), a deep learning framework for simultaneous multi-horizon commodity price prediction and discovery of interpretable latent market drivers. The RSAE forecasts prices at multiple horizons (e.g., 1-day, 1-week, 1-month) using multivariate time series. Crucially, L1 regularization ($\|\mathbf{z}\|_1$) on its latent vector $\mathbf{z}$ enforces sparsity, promoting parsimonious explanations of market dynamics through learned factors representing underlying drivers (e.g., demand, supply shocks). Drawing from energy-based models and sparse coding, the RSAE optimizes predictive accuracy while learning sparse representations. Evaluated on historical Copper and Crude Oil data with numerous indicators, our findings indicate the RSAE offers competitive multi-horizon forecasting accuracy and data-driven insights into price dynamics via its interpretable latent space, a key advantage over traditional black-box approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have highlighted the remarkable capabilities of neural network (NN)-powered systems on classical computers. However, these systems face significant computational challenges that limit scalability and efficiency. Quantum computers hold the potential to overcome these limitations and increase processing power beyond classical systems. Despite this, integrating quantum computing with NNs remains largely unrealized due to challenges posed by noise, decoherence, and high error rates in current quantum hardware. Here, we propose a novel quantum echo-state network (QESN) design and implementation algorithm that can operate within the presence of noise on current IBM hardware. We apply classical control-theoretic response analysis to characterize the QESN, emphasizing its rich nonlinear dynamics and memory, as well as its ability to be fine-tuned with sparsity and re-uploading blocks. We validate our approach through a comprehensive demonstration of QESNs functioning as quantum observers, applied in both high-fidelity simulations and hardware experiments utilizing data from a prototypical chaotic Lorenz system. Our results show that the QESN can predict long time-series with persistent memory, running over 100 times longer than the median T}1 and T2 of the IBM Marrakesh QPU, achieving state-of-the-art time-series performance on superconducting hardware.

Abstract: Following the successful hosts of the 1-st (NLPCC 2023 Foshan) CMIVQA and the 2-rd (NLPCC 2024 Hangzhou) MMIVQA challenges, this year, a new task has been introduced to further advance research in multi-modal, multilingual, and multi-hop medical instructional question answering (M4IVQA) systems, with a specific focus on medical instructional videos. The M4IVQA challenge focuses on evaluating models that integrate information from medical instructional videos, understand multiple languages, and answer multi-hop questions requiring reasoning over various modalities. This task consists of three tracks: multi-modal, multilingual, and multi-hop Temporal Answer Grounding in Single Video (M4TAGSV), multi-modal, multilingual, and multi-hop Video Corpus Retrieval (M4VCR) and multi-modal, multilingual, and multi-hop Temporal Answer Grounding in Video Corpus (M4TAGVC). Participants in M4IVQA are expected to develop algorithms capable of processing both video and text data, understanding multilingual queries, and providing relevant answers to multi-hop medical questions. We believe the newly introduced M4IVQA challenge will drive innovations in multimodal reasoning systems for healthcare scenarios, ultimately contributing to smarter emergency response systems and more effective medical education platforms in multilingual communities.

Abstract: Current hardware security verification processes predominantly rely on manual threat modeling and test plan generation, which are labor-intensive, error-prone, and struggle to scale with increasing design complexity and evolving attack methodologies. To address these challenges, we propose ThreatLens, an LLM-driven multi-agent framework that automates security threat modeling and test plan generation for hardware security verification. ThreatLens integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to extract relevant security knowledge, LLM-powered reasoning for threat assessment, and interactive user feedback to ensure the generation of practical test plans. By automating these processes, the framework reduces the manual verification effort, enhances coverage, and ensures a structured, adaptable approach to security verification. We evaluated our framework on the NEORV32 SoC, demonstrating its capability to automate security verification through structured test plans and validating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Watermarking AI-generated text is critical for combating misuse. Yet recent theoretical work argues that any watermark can be erased via random walk attacks that perturb text while preserving quality. However, such attacks rely on two key assumptions: (1) rapid mixing (watermarks dissolve quickly under perturbations) and (2) reliable quality preservation (automated quality oracles perfectly guide edits). Through large-scale experiments and human-validated assessments, we find mixing is slow: 100% of perturbed texts retain traces of their origin after hundreds of edits, defying rapid mixing. Oracles falter, as state-of-the-art quality detectors misjudge edits (77% accuracy), compounding errors during attacks. Ultimately, attacks underperform: automated walks remove watermarks just 26% of the time -- dropping to 10% under human quality review. These findings challenge the inevitability of watermark removal. Instead, practical barriers -- slow mixing and imperfect quality control -- reveal watermarking to be far more robust than theoretical models suggest. The gap between idealized attacks and real-world feasibility underscores the need for stronger watermarking methods and more realistic attack models.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are increasingly central to frontier model architectures. By selectively activating parameters, they reduce computational cost while scaling total parameter count. This paper investigates the impact of the number of active experts, termed granularity, comparing architectures with many (e.g., 8 per layer in DeepSeek) to those with fewer (e.g., 1 per layer in Llama-4 models). We prove an exponential separation in network expressivity based on this design parameter, suggesting that models benefit from higher granularity. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings and illustrate this separation.

Abstract: As digital media platforms strive to meet evolving user expectations, delivering highly personalized and intuitive movies and media recommendations has become essential for attracting and retaining audiences. Traditional systems often rely on keyword-based search and recommendation techniques, which limit users to specific keywords and a combination of keywords. This paper proposes an approach that generates synthetic datasets by modeling real-world user interactions, creating complex chat-style data reflective of diverse preferences. This allows users to express more information with complex preferences, such as mood, plot details, and thematic elements, in addition to conventional criteria like genre, title, and actor-based searches. In today's search space, users cannot write queries like ``Looking for a fantasy movie featuring dire wolves, ideally set in a harsh frozen world with themes of loyalty and survival.''
  Building on these contributions, we evaluate synthetic datasets for diversity and effectiveness in training and benchmarking models, particularly in areas often absent from traditional datasets. This approach enhances personalization and accuracy by enabling expressive and natural user queries. It establishes a foundation for the next generation of conversational AI-driven search and recommendation systems in digital entertainment.

Abstract: In the field of digital security, Reversible Adversarial Examples (RAE) combine adversarial attacks with reversible data hiding techniques to effectively protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized analysis by malicious Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, existing RAE techniques primarily focus on white-box attacks, lacking a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness in black-box scenarios. This limitation impedes their broader deployment in complex, dynamic environments. Further more, traditional black-box attacks are often characterized by poor transferability and high query costs, significantly limiting their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Phase Merging Transferable Reversible Attack method, which generates highly transferable initial adversarial perturbations in a white-box model and employs a memory augmented black-box strategy to effectively mislead target mod els. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving a 99.0% attack success rate and 100% recovery rate in black-box scenarios, highlighting its robustness in privacy protection. Moreover, we successfully implemented a black-box attack on a commercial model, further substantiating the potential of this approach for practical use.

Abstract: Current robotic planning methods often rely on predicting multi-frame images with full pixel details. While this fine-grained approach can serve as a generic world model, it introduces two significant challenges for downstream policy learning: substantial computational costs that hinder real-time deployment, and accumulated inaccuracies that can mislead action extraction. Planning with coarse-grained subgoals partially alleviates efficiency issues. However, their forward planning schemes can still result in off-task predictions due to accumulation errors, leading to misalignment with long-term goals. This raises a critical question: Can robotic planning be both efficient and accurate enough for real-time control in long-horizon, multi-stage tasks? To address this, we propose a Latent Space Backward Planning scheme (LBP), which begins by grounding the task into final latent goals, followed by recursively predicting intermediate subgoals closer to the current state. The grounded final goal enables backward subgoal planning to always remain aware of task completion, facilitating on-task prediction along the entire planning horizon. The subgoal-conditioned policy incorporates a learnable token to summarize the subgoal sequences and determines how each subgoal guides action extraction. Through extensive simulation and real-robot long-horizon experiments, we show that LBP outperforms existing fine-grained and forward planning methods, achieving SOTA performance.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has attracted significant attention, leading to the de-velopment of a wide range of approaches, from traditional statistical meth-ods to advanced deep learning models. Among them, the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model remains a widely adopted linear technique due to its effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies in economic, industrial, and social data. On the other hand, polynomial classifi-ers offer a robust framework for capturing non-linear relationships and have demonstrated competitive performance in domains such as stock price pre-diction. In this study, we propose a hybrid forecasting approach that inte-grates the ARIMA model with a polynomial classifier to leverage the com-plementary strengths of both models. The hybrid method is evaluated on multiple real-world time series datasets spanning diverse domains. Perfor-mance is assessed based on forecasting accuracy and computational effi-ciency. Experimental results reveal that the proposed hybrid model consist-ently outperforms the individual models in terms of prediction accuracy, al-beit with a modest increase in execution time.

Abstract: Domain generalization in image classification is a crucial challenge, with models often failing to generalize well across unseen datasets. We address this issue by introducing a neuro-inspired Neural Response Normalization (NeuRN) layer which draws inspiration from neurons in the mammalian visual cortex, which aims to enhance the performance of deep learning architectures on unseen target domains by training deep learning models on a source domain. The performance of these models is considered as a baseline and then compared against models integrated with NeuRN on image classification tasks. We perform experiments across a range of deep learning architectures, including ones derived from Neural Architecture Search and Vision Transformer. Additionally, in order to shortlist models for our experiment from amongst the vast range of deep neural networks available which have shown promising results, we also propose a novel method that uses the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to compute similarity between deep learning architectures. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuRN by showing improvement against baseline in cross-domain image classification tasks. Our framework attempts to establish a foundation for future neuro-inspired deep learning models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant strides in legged robot control, enabling locomotion across diverse terrains and complex loco-manipulation capabilities. However, the commonly used position or velocity tracking-based objectives are agnostic to forces experienced by the robot, leading to stiff and potentially dangerous behaviors and poor control during forceful interactions. To address this limitation, we present \emph{Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking} (FACET). Inspired by impedance control, we use RL to train a control policy to imitate a virtual mass-spring-damper system, allowing fine-grained control under external forces by manipulating the virtual spring. In simulation, we demonstrate that our quadruped robot achieves improved robustness to large impulses (up to 200 Ns) and exhibits controllable compliance, achieving an 80% reduction in collision impulse. The policy is deployed to a physical robot to showcase both compliance and the ability to engage with large forces by kinesthetic control and pulling payloads up to 2/3 of its weight. Further extension to a legged loco-manipulator and a humanoid shows the applicability of our method to more complex settings to enable whole-body compliance control.

Abstract: The mouse is one of the most studied animal models in the field of systems neuroscience. Understanding the generalized patterns and decoding the neural representations that are evoked by the diverse range of natural scene stimuli in the mouse visual cortex is one of the key quests in computational vision. In recent years, significant parallels have been drawn between the primate visual cortex and hierarchical deep neural networks. However, their generalized efficacy in understanding mouse vision has been limited. In this study, we investigate the functional alignment between the mouse visual cortex and deep learning models for object classification tasks. We first introduce a generalized representational learning strategy that uncovers a striking resemblance between the functional mapping of the mouse visual cortex and high-performing deep learning models on both top-down (population-level) and bottom-up (single cell-level) scenarios. Next, this representational similarity across the two systems is further enhanced by the addition of Neural Response Normalization (NeuRN) layer, inspired by the activation profile of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex. To test the performance effect of NeuRN on real-world tasks, we integrate it into deep learning models and observe significant improvements in their robustness against data shifts in domain generalization tasks. Our work proposes a novel framework for comparing the functional architecture of the mouse visual cortex with deep learning models. Our findings carry broad implications for the development of advanced AI models that draw inspiration from the mouse visual cortex, suggesting that these models serve as valuable tools for studying the neural representations of the mouse visual cortex and, as a result, enhancing their performance on real-world tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on diverse NLP tasks through pre-training and fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning the model with a large number of parameters on limited downstream datasets often leads to vulnerability to adversarial attacks, causing overfitting of the model on standard datasets.
  To address these issues, we propose IM-BERT from the perspective of a dynamic system by conceptualizing a layer of BERT as a solution of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Under the situation of initial value perturbation, we analyze the numerical stability of two main numerical ODE solvers: the explicit and implicit Euler approaches.
  Based on these analyses, we introduce a numerically robust IM-connection incorporating BERT's layers. This strategy enhances the robustness of PLMs against adversarial attacks, even in low-resource scenarios, without introducing additional parameters or adversarial training strategies.
  Experimental results on the adversarial GLUE (AdvGLUE) dataset validate the robustness of IM-BERT under various conditions. Compared to the original BERT, IM-BERT exhibits a performance improvement of approximately 8.3\%p on the AdvGLUE dataset. Furthermore, in low-resource scenarios, IM-BERT outperforms BERT by achieving 5.9\%p higher accuracy.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have significantly advanced the field of novel view synthesis, yet their generalization across diverse scenes and conditions remains challenging. Addressing this, we propose the integration of a novel brain-inspired normalization technique Neural Generalization (NeuGen) into leading NeRF architectures which include MVSNeRF and GeoNeRF. NeuGen extracts the domain-invariant features, thereby enhancing the models' generalization capabilities. It can be seamlessly integrated into NeRF architectures and cultivates a comprehensive feature set that significantly improves accuracy and robustness in image rendering. Through this integration, NeuGen shows improved performance on benchmarks on diverse datasets across state-of-the-art NeRF architectures, enabling them to generalize better across varied scenes. Our comprehensive evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, confirm that our approach not only surpasses existing models in generalizability but also markedly improves rendering quality. Our work exemplifies the potential of merging neuroscientific principles with deep learning frameworks, setting a new precedent for enhanced generalizability and efficiency in novel view synthesis. A demo of our study is available at https://neugennerf.github.io.

Abstract: In the era of big data, data mining has become indispensable for uncovering hidden patterns and insights from vast and complex datasets. The integration of multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL, often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness in MFL within the Clusters. MMiC replaces partial parameters within client models inside clusters to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Furthermore, it leverages the Banzhaf Power Index to optimize client selection under these conditions. Finally, MMiC employs an innovative approach to dynamically control global aggregation by utilizing Markovitz Portfolio Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMiC consistently outperforms existing federated learning architectures in both global and personalized performance on multimodal datasets with missing modalities, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed solution.

Abstract: From automated intrusion testing to discovery of zero-day attacks before software launch, agentic AI calls for great promises in security engineering. This strong capability is bound with a similar threat: the security and research community must build up its models before the approach is leveraged by malicious actors for cybercrime. We therefore propose and evaluate RedTeamLLM, an integrated architecture with a comprehensive security model for automatization of pentest tasks. RedTeamLLM follows three key steps: summarizing, reasoning and act, which embed its operational capacity. This novel framework addresses four open challenges: plan correction, memory management, context window constraint, and generality vs. specialization. Evaluation is performed through the automated resolution of a range of entry-level, but not trivial, CTF challenges. The contribution of the reasoning capability of our agentic AI framework is specifically evaluated.

Abstract: Inverse electromagnetic modeling has emerged as a powerful approach for designing complex microwave structures with high accuracy and efficiency. In this study, we propose an Iterative Residual Correction Network (IRC-Net) for the inverse design of Ku-band Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) components based on multimode resonators. We use a multimode resonance structure to demonstrate that it is possible to control the resonances of the structure. Therefore, these structures can be used for resonant components and smart filter design. The proposed deep learning architecture leverages residual neural networks to overcome the limitations of traditional inverse design techniques, such as the Feedforward Inverse Model (FIM), offering improved generalization and prediction accuracy. The approach begins with a FIM to generate initial design estimates, followed by an iterative correction strategy inspired by the Hybrid Inverse-Forward Residual Refinement Network (HiFR\textsuperscript{2}-Net), which we call IRC-Net. Experiments demonstrate that the IRC-Net achieves substantial improvements in prediction accuracy compared to traditional single-stage networks, validated through statistical metrics, full-wave electromagnetic simulations, and measurements. To validate the proposed framework, we first design and fabricate a three-resonance SIW structure. Next, we apply the trained IRC-Net model to predict the geometry of a four-resonance structure based on its desired frequency response. Both designs are fabricated and tested, showing strong agreement between the simulated, predicted, and measured results, confirming the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach for the autonomous landing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using only a front-facing monocular camera, therefore obviating the requirement for depth estimation cameras. Drawing on the inherent human estimating process, the proposed method reframes the landing task as an optimization problem. The UAV employs variations in the visual characteristics of a specially designed lenticular circle on the landing pad, where the perceived color and form provide critical information for estimating both altitude and depth. Reinforcement learning algorithms are utilized to approximate the functions governing these estimations, enabling the UAV to ascertain ideal landing settings via training. This method's efficacy is assessed by simulations and experiments, showcasing its potential for robust and accurate autonomous landing without dependence on complex sensor setups. This research contributes to the advancement of cost-effective and efficient UAV landing solutions, paving the way for wider applicability across various fields.

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate the emotional distress of individuals through effective conversations. Although large language models (LLMs) have obtained remarkable progress on ESC, most of these studies might not define the diagram from the state model perspective, therefore providing a suboptimal solution for long-term satisfaction. To address such an issue, we leverage the Q-learning on LLMs, and propose a framework called straQ*. Our framework allows a plug-and-play LLM to bootstrap the planning during ESC, determine the optimal strategy based on long-term returns, and finally guide the LLM to response. Substantial experiments on ESC datasets suggest that straQ* outperforms many baselines, including direct inference, self-refine, chain of thought, finetuning, and finite state machines.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new perspective for analyzing the generalization power of deep neural networks (DNNs), i.e., directly disentangling and analyzing the dynamics of generalizable and non-generalizable interaction encoded by a DNN through the training process. Specifically, this work builds upon the recent theoretical achievement in explainble AI, which proves that the detailed inference logic of DNNs can be can be strictly rewritten as a small number of AND-OR interaction patterns. Based on this, we propose an efficient method to quantify the generalization power of each interaction, and we discover a distinct three-phase dynamics of the generalization power of interactions during training. In particular, the early phase of training typically removes noisy and non-generalizable interactions and learns simple and generalizable ones. The second and the third phases tend to capture increasingly complex interactions that are harder to generalize. Experimental results verify that the learning of non-generalizable interactions is the the direct cause for the gap between the training and testing losses.

Abstract: Hand shadow art is a captivating art form, creatively using hand shadows to reproduce expressive shapes on the wall. In this work, we study an inverse problem: given a target shape, find the poses of left and right hands that together best produce a shadow resembling the input. This problem is nontrivial, since the design space of 3D hand poses is huge while being restrictive due to anatomical constraints. Also, we need to attend to the input's shape and crucial features, though the input is colorless and textureless. To meet these challenges, we design Hand-Shadow Poser, a three-stage pipeline, to decouple the anatomical constraints (by hand) and semantic constraints (by shadow shape): (i) a generative hand assignment module to explore diverse but reasonable left/right-hand shape hypotheses; (ii) a generalized hand-shadow alignment module to infer coarse hand poses with a similarity-driven strategy for selecting hypotheses; and (iii) a shadow-feature-aware refinement module to optimize the hand poses for physical plausibility and shadow feature preservation. Further, we design our pipeline to be trainable on generic public hand data, thus avoiding the need for any specialized training dataset. For method validation, we build a benchmark of 210 diverse shadow shapes of varying complexity and a comprehensive set of metrics, including a novel DINOv2-based evaluation metric. Through extensive comparisons with multiple baselines and user studies, our approach is demonstrated to effectively generate bimanual hand poses for a large variety of hand shapes for over 85% of the benchmark cases.

Abstract: Remote physiological sensing using camera-based technologies offers transformative potential for non-invasive vital sign monitoring across healthcare and human-computer interaction domains. Although deep learning approaches have advanced the extraction of physiological signals from video data, existing methods have not been sufficiently assessed for their robustness to domain shifts. These shifts in remote physiological sensing include variations in ambient conditions, camera specifications, head movements, facial poses, and physiological states which often impact real-world performance significantly. Cross-dataset evaluation provides an objective measure to assess generalization capabilities across these domain shifts. We introduce Target Signal Constrained Factorization module (TSFM), a novel multidimensional attention mechanism that explicitly incorporates physiological signal characteristics as factorization constraints, allowing more precise feature extraction. Building on this innovation, we present MMRPhys, an efficient dual-branch 3D-CNN architecture designed for simultaneous multitask estimation of photoplethysmography (rPPG) and respiratory (rRSP) signals from multimodal RGB and thermal video inputs. Through comprehensive cross-dataset evaluation on five benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that MMRPhys with TSFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalization across domain shifts for rPPG and rRSP estimation, while maintaining a minimal inference latency suitable for real-time applications. Our approach establishes new benchmarks for robust multitask and multimodal physiological sensing and offers a computationally efficient framework for practical deployment in unconstrained environments. The web browser-based application featuring on-device real-time inference of MMRPhys model is available at https://physiologicailab.github.io/mmrphys-live

Abstract: This paper presents R-CAGE (Rhythmic Control Architecture for Guarding Ego), a theoretical framework for restructuring emotional output in long-term human-AI interaction. While prior affective computing approaches emphasized expressiveness, immersion, and responsiveness, they often neglected the cognitive and structural consequences of repeated emotional engagement. R-CAGE instead conceptualizes emotional output not as reactive expression but as ethical design structure requiring architectural intervention. The model is grounded in experiential observations of subtle affective symptoms such as localized head tension, interpretive fixation, and emotional lag arising from prolonged interaction with affective AI systems. These indicate a mismatch between system-driven emotion and user interpretation that cannot be fully explained by biometric data or observable behavior. R-CAGE adopts a user-centered stance prioritizing psychological recovery, interpretive autonomy, and identity continuity. The framework consists of four control blocks: (1) Control of Rhythmic Expression regulates output pacing to reduce fatigue; (2) Architecture of Sensory Structuring adjusts intensity and timing of affective stimuli; (3) Guarding of Cognitive Framing reduces semantic pressure to allow flexible interpretation; (4) Ego-Aligned Response Design supports self-reference recovery during interpretive lag. By structurally regulating emotional rhythm, sensory intensity, and interpretive affordances, R-CAGE frames emotion not as performative output but as sustainable design unit. The goal is to protect users from oversaturation and cognitive overload while sustaining long-term interpretive agency in AI-mediated environments.

Abstract: We study the problem of monitoring machine learning models under gradual distribution shifts, where circumstances change slowly over time, often leading to unnoticed yet significant declines in accuracy. To address this, we propose Incremental Uncertainty-aware Performance Monitoring (IUPM), a novel label-free method that estimates performance changes by modeling gradual shifts using optimal transport. In addition, IUPM quantifies the uncertainty in the performance prediction and introduces an active labeling procedure to restore a reliable estimate under a limited labeling budget. Our experiments show that IUPM outperforms existing performance estimation baselines in various gradual shift scenarios and that its uncertainty awareness guides label acquisition more effectively compared to other strategies.

Abstract: Diabetes remains a significant health challenge globally, contributing to severe complications like kidney disease, vision loss, and heart issues. The application of machine learning (ML) in healthcare enables efficient and accurate disease prediction, offering avenues for early intervention and patient support. Our study introduces an innovative diabetes prediction framework, leveraging both traditional ML techniques such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Na\"ive Bayes, and Random Forest and advanced ensemble methods like AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, and XGBoost. Central to our approach is the development of a novel model, DNet, a hybrid architecture combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers for effective feature extraction and sequential learning. The DNet model comprises an initial convolutional block for capturing essential features, followed by a residual block with skip connections to facilitate efficient information flow. Batch Normalization and Dropout are employed for robust regularization, and an LSTM layer captures temporal dependencies within the data. Using a Kaggle-sourced real-world diabetes dataset, our model evaluation spans cross-validation accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. Among the models, DNet demonstrates the highest efficacy with an accuracy of 99.79% and an AUC-ROC of 99.98%, establishing its potential for superior diabetes prediction. This robust hybrid architecture showcases the value of combining CNN and LSTM layers, emphasizing its applicability in medical diagnostics and disease prediction tasks.

Abstract: Device heterogeneity poses major challenges in Federated Learning (FL), where resource-constrained clients slow down synchronous schemes that wait for all updates before aggregation. Asynchronous FL addresses this by incorporating updates as they arrive, substantially improving efficiency. While its efficiency gains are well recognized, its privacy costs remain largely unexplored, particularly for high-end devices that contribute updates more frequently, increasing their cumulative privacy exposure. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of the efficiency-fairness-privacy trade-off in synchronous vs. asynchronous FL under realistic device heterogeneity. We empirically compare FedAvg and staleness-aware FedAsync using a physical testbed of five edge devices spanning diverse hardware tiers, integrating Local Differential Privacy (LDP) and the Moments Accountant to quantify per-client privacy loss. Using Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) as a privacy-critical benchmark, we show that FedAsync achieves up to 10x faster convergence but exacerbates fairness and privacy disparities: high-end devices contribute 6-10x more updates and incur up to 5x higher privacy loss, while low-end devices suffer amplified accuracy degradation due to infrequent, stale, and noise-perturbed updates. These findings motivate the need for adaptive FL protocols that jointly optimize aggregation and privacy mechanisms based on client capacity and participation dynamics, moving beyond static, one-size-fits-all solutions.

Abstract: We present Seed1.5-VL, a vision-language foundation model designed to advance general-purpose multimodal understanding and reasoning. Seed1.5-VL is composed with a 532M-parameter vision encoder and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLM of 20B active parameters. Despite its relatively compact architecture, it delivers strong performance across a wide spectrum of public VLM benchmarks and internal evaluation suites, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on 38 out of 60 public benchmarks. Moreover, in agent-centric tasks such as GUI control and gameplay, Seed1.5-VL outperforms leading multimodal systems, including OpenAI CUA and Claude 3.7. Beyond visual and video understanding, it also demonstrates strong reasoning abilities, making it particularly effective for multimodal reasoning challenges such as visual puzzles. We believe these capabilities will empower broader applications across diverse tasks. In this report, we mainly provide a comprehensive review of our experiences in building Seed1.5-VL across model design, data construction, and training at various stages, hoping that this report can inspire further research. Seed1.5-VL is now accessible at https://www.volcengine.com/ (Volcano Engine Model ID: doubao-1-5-thinking-vision-pro-250428)

Abstract: While powerful and well-established, tools like ParaView present a steep learning curve that discourages many potential users. This work introduces ParaView-MCP, an autonomous agent that integrates modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with ParaView to not only lower the barrier to entry but also augment ParaView with intelligent decision support. By leveraging the state-of-the-art reasoning, command execution, and vision capabilities of MLLMs, ParaView-MCP enables users to interact with ParaView through natural language and visual inputs. Specifically, our system adopted the Model Context Protocol (MCP) - a standardized interface for model-application communication - that facilitates direct interaction between MLLMs with ParaView's Python API to allow seamless information exchange between the user, the language model, and the visualization tool itself. Furthermore, by implementing a visual feedback mechanism that allows the agent to observe the viewport, we unlock a range of new capabilities, including recreating visualizations from examples, closed-loop visualization parameter updates based on user-defined goals, and even cross-application collaboration involving multiple tools. Broadly, we believe such an agent-driven visualization paradigm can profoundly change the way we interact with visualization tools. We expect a significant uptake in the development of such visualization tools, in both visualization research and industry.

<title>Can LLM-based Financial Investing Strategies Outperform the Market in Long Run?</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been leveraged for asset pricing tasks and stock trading applications, enabling AI agents to generate investment decisions from unstructured financial data. However, most evaluations of LLM timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.

Abstract: Human videos offer a scalable way to train robot manipulation policies, but lack the action labels needed by standard imitation learning algorithms. Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Si introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes. Code and videos are available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Sim/.

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a key task in industrial settings, where minimizing waste and operational costs is essential. Deploying deep learning models within Internet of Things (IoT) environments introduces specific challenges due to the limited computational power and bandwidth of edge devices. This study investigates how to perform VAD effectively under such constraints by leveraging compact and efficient processing strategies. We evaluate several data compression techniques, examining the trade-off between system latency and detection accuracy. Experiments on the MVTec AD benchmark demonstrate that significant compression can be achieved with minimal loss in anomaly detection performance compared to uncompressed data.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of large language models and vision-language models, AI agents have evolved from isolated, task-specific systems into autonomous, interactive entities capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting without human intervention. As these agents proliferate across virtual and physical environments, from virtual assistants to embodied robots, the need for a unified, agent-centric infrastructure becomes paramount. In this survey, we introduce the Internet of Agents (IoA) as a foundational framework that enables seamless interconnection, dynamic discovery, and collaborative orchestration among heterogeneous agents at scale. We begin by presenting a general IoA architecture, highlighting its hierarchical organization, distinguishing features relative to the traditional Internet, and emerging applications. Next, we analyze the key operational enablers of IoA, including capability notification and discovery, adaptive communication protocols, dynamic task matching, consensus and conflict-resolution mechanisms, and incentive models. Finally, we identify open research directions toward building resilient and trustworthy IoA ecosystems.

Abstract: Crucial in disease analysis and surgical planning, manual segmentation of volumetric medical scans (e.g. MRI, CT) is laborious, error-prone, and challenging to master, while fully automatic algorithms can benefit from user-feedback. Therefore, with the complementary power of the latest radiological AI foundation models and virtual reality (VR)'s intuitive data interaction, we propose SAMIRA, a novel conversational AI agent that assists users with localizing, segmenting, and visualizing 3D medical concepts in VR. Through speech-based interaction, the agent helps users understand radiological features, locate clinical targets, and generate segmentation masks that can be refined with just a few point prompts. The system also supports true-to-scale 3D visualization of segmented pathology to enhance patient-specific anatomical understanding. Furthermore, to determine the optimal interaction paradigm under near-far attention-switching for refining segmentation masks in an immersive, human-in-the-loop workflow, we compare VR controller pointing, head pointing, and eye tracking as input modes. With a user study, evaluations demonstrated a high usability score (SUS=90.0 $\pm$ 9.0), low overall task load, as well as strong support for the proposed VR system's guidance, training potential, and integration of AI in radiological segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems combine large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieval, making them highly effective for knowledge-intensive tasks. A crucial but often under-explored component of these systems is the reranker, which refines retrieved documents to enhance generation quality and explainability. The challenge of selecting the optimal number of documents (k) remains unsolved: too few may omit critical information, while too many introduce noise and inefficiencies. Although recent studies have explored LLM-based rerankers, they primarily leverage internal model knowledge and overlook the rich supervisory signals that LLMs can provide, such as using response quality as feedback for optimizing reranking decisions. In this paper, we propose DynamicRAG, a novel RAG framework where the reranker dynamically adjusts both the order and number of retrieved documents based on the query. We model the reranker as an agent optimized through reinforcement learning (RL), using rewards derived from LLM output quality. Across seven knowledge-intensive datasets, DynamicRAG demonstrates superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results. The model, data and code are available at https://github.com/GasolSun36/DynamicRAG

Abstract: We present UAV-CodeAgents, a scalable multi-agent framework for autonomous UAV mission generation, built on large language and vision-language models (LLMs/VLMs). The system leverages the ReAct (Reason + Act) paradigm to interpret satellite imagery, ground high-level natural language instructions, and collaboratively generate UAV trajectories with minimal human supervision. A core component is a vision-grounded, pixel-pointing mechanism that enables precise localization of semantic targets on aerial maps. To support real-time adaptability, we introduce a reactive thinking loop, allowing agents to iteratively reflect on observations, revise mission goals, and coordinate dynamically in evolving environments.
  UAV-CodeAgents is evaluated on large-scale mission scenarios involving industrial and environmental fire detection. Our results show that a lower decoding temperature (0.5) yields higher planning reliability and reduced execution time, with an average mission creation time of 96.96 seconds and a success rate of 93%. We further fine-tune Qwen2.5VL-7B on 9,000 annotated satellite images, achieving strong spatial grounding across diverse visual categories. To foster reproducibility and future research, we will release the full codebase and a novel benchmark dataset for vision-language-based UAV planning.

Abstract: With the growing use of large language models (LLMs) hosted on cloud platforms to offer inference services, privacy concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive information are escalating. Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is a promising solution to protect the privacy in LLM inference. However, MPC requires frequent inter-server communication, causing high performance overhead.
  Inspired by the prevalent activation sparsity of LLMs, where most neuron are not activated after non-linear activation functions, we propose an efficient private inference system, Comet. This system employs an accurate and fast predictor to predict the sparsity distribution of activation function output. Additionally, we introduce a new private inference protocol. It efficiently and securely avoids computations involving zero values by exploiting the spatial locality of the predicted sparse distribution. While this computation-avoidance approach impacts the spatiotemporal continuity of KV cache entries, we address this challenge with a low-communication overhead cache refilling strategy that merges miss requests and incorporates a prefetching mechanism. Finally, we evaluate Comet on four common LLMs and compare it with six state-of-the-art private inference systems. Comet achieves a 1.87x-2.63x speedup and a 1.94x-2.64x communication reduction.

Abstract: Predicting future vehicle purchases among existing owners presents a critical challenge due to extreme class imbalance (<0.5% positive rate) and complex behavioral patterns. We propose REMEDI (Relative feature Enhanced Meta-learning with Distillation for Imbalanced prediction), a novel multi-stage framework addressing these challenges. REMEDI first trains diverse base models to capture complementary aspects of user behavior. Second, inspired by comparative op-timization techniques, we introduce relative performance meta-features (deviation from ensemble mean, rank among peers) for effective model fusion through a hybrid-expert architecture. Third, we distill the ensemble's knowledge into a single efficient model via supervised fine-tuning with MSE loss, enabling practical deployment. Evaluated on approximately 800,000 vehicle owners, REMEDI significantly outperforms baseline approaches, achieving the business target of identifying ~50% of actual buyers within the top 60,000 recommendations at ~10% precision. The distilled model preserves the ensemble's predictive power while maintaining deployment efficiency, demonstrating REMEDI's effectiveness for imbalanced prediction in industry settings.

Abstract: Subjective Answer Grading (SAG) plays a crucial role in education, standardized testing, and automated assessment systems, particularly for evaluating short-form responses in Short Answer Scoring (SAS). However, existing approaches often produce coarse-grained scores and lack detailed reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as zero-shot evaluators, they remain susceptible to bias, inconsistencies with human judgment, and limited transparency in scoring decisions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SAS-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based SAS tasks. SAS-Bench provides fine-grained, step-wise scoring, expert-annotated error categories, and a diverse range of question types derived from real-world subject-specific exams. This benchmark facilitates detailed evaluation of model reasoning processes and explainability. We also release an open-source dataset containing 1,030 questions and 4,109 student responses, each annotated by domain experts. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments with various LLMs, identifying major challenges in scoring science-related questions and highlighting the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in improving scoring accuracy. Our work offers valuable insights into the development of more robust, fair, and educationally meaningful LLM-based evaluation systems.

Abstract: Large vision language models (LVLMs) achieve remarkable performance through Vision In-context Learning (VICL), a process that depends significantly on demonstrations retrieved from an extensive collection of annotated examples (retrieval database). Existing studies often assume that the retrieval database contains annotated examples for all labels. However, in real-world scenarios, delays in database updates or incomplete data annotation may result in the retrieval database containing labeled samples for only a subset of classes. We refer to this phenomenon as an \textbf{incomplete retrieval database} and define the in-context learning under this condition as \textbf{Incomplete In-context Learning (IICL)}. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{Iterative Judgments and Integrated Prediction (IJIP)}, a two-stage framework designed to mitigate the limitations of IICL. The Iterative Judgments Stage reformulates an \(\boldsymbol{m}\)-class classification problem into a series of \(\boldsymbol{m}\) binary classification tasks, effectively converting the IICL setting into a standard VICL scenario. The Integrated Prediction Stage further refines the classification process by leveraging both the input image and the predictions from the Iterative Judgments Stage to enhance overall classification accuracy. IJIP demonstrates considerable performance across two LVLMs and two datasets under three distinct conditions of label incompleteness, achieving the highest accuracy of 93.9\%. Notably, even in scenarios where labels are fully available, IJIP still achieves the best performance of all six baselines. Furthermore, IJIP can be directly applied to \textbf{Prompt Learning} and is adaptable to the \textbf{text domain}.

Abstract: Textual adversarial attacks mislead NLP models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), by subtly modifying text. While effective, existing attacks often require knowledge of the victim model, extensive queries, or access to training data, limiting real-world feasibility. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the \textbf{Victim Data-based Adversarial Attack (VDBA)}, which operates using only victim texts. To prevent access to the victim model, we create a shadow dataset with publicly available pre-trained models and clustering methods as a foundation for developing substitute models. To address the low attack success rate (ASR) due to insufficient information feedback, we propose the hierarchical substitution model design, generating substitute models to mitigate the failure of a single substitute model at the decision boundary.
  Concurrently, we use diverse adversarial example generation, employing various attack methods to generate and select the adversarial example with better similarity and attack effectiveness. Experiments on the Emotion and SST5 datasets show that VDBA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an ASR improvement of 52.08\% while significantly reducing attack queries to 0. More importantly, we discover that VDBA poses a significant threat to LLMs such as Qwen2 and the GPT family, and achieves the highest ASR of 45.99% even without access to the API, confirming that advanced NLP models still face serious security risks. Our codes can be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VDBA-Victim-Data-based-Adversarial-Attack-36EC/

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising approach for scaling Transformer models. While initial works primarily incorporated MoE into feed-forward network (FFN) layers, recent studies have explored extending the MoE paradigm to attention layers to enhance model performance. However, existing attention-based MoE layers require specialized implementations and demonstrate suboptimal performance compared to their FFN-based counterparts. In this paper, we aim to unify the MoE designs in attention and FFN layers by introducing a novel reformulation of the attention mechanism, revealing an underlying FFN-like structure within attention modules. Our proposed architecture, UMoE, achieves superior performance through attention-based MoE layers while enabling efficient parameter sharing between FFN and attention components.

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown strong performance in short-horizon tasks but often fail in complex, long-horizon settings. We trace the failure to loose coupling between high-level (HL) sub-goal selection and low-level (LL) trajectory generation, which leads to incoherent plans and degraded performance. We propose Coupled Hierarchical Diffusion (CHD), a framework that models HL sub-goals and LL trajectories jointly within a unified diffusion process. A shared classifier passes LL feedback upstream so that sub-goals self-correct while sampling proceeds. This tight HL-LL coupling improves trajectory coherence and enables scalable long-horizon diffusion planning. Experiments across maze navigation, tabletop manipulation, and household environments show that CHD consistently outperforms both flat and hierarchical diffusion baselines.

Abstract: The Bradley-Terry (BT) model is widely practiced in reward modeling for reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Despite its effectiveness, reward models (RMs) trained with BT model loss are prone to over-optimization, losing generalizability to unseen input distributions. In this paper, we study the cause of over-optimization in RM training and its downstream effects on the RLHF procedure, accentuating the importance of distributional robustness of RMs in unseen data. First, we show that the excessive dispersion of hidden state norms is the main source of over-optimization. Then, we propose batch-wise sum-to-zero regularization (BSR) to enforce zero-centered reward sum per batch, constraining the rewards with extreme magnitudes. We assess the impact of BSR in improving robustness in RMs through four scenarios of over-optimization, where BSR consistently manifests better robustness. Subsequently, we compare the plain BT model and BSR on RLHF training and empirically show that robust RMs better align the policy to the gold preference model. Finally, we apply BSR to high-quality data and models, which surpasses state-of-the-art RMs in the 8B scale by adding more than 5% in complex preference prediction tasks. By conducting RLOO training with 8B RMs, AlpacaEval 2.0 reduces generation length by 40% while adding a 7% increase in win rate, further highlighting that robustness in RMs induces robustness in RLHF training. We release the code, data, and models: https://github.com/LinkedIn-XFACT/RM-Robustness.

Abstract: In the digital streaming landscape, it's becoming increasingly challenging for artists and industry experts to predict the success of music tracks. This study introduces a pioneering methodology that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Spotify data analysis to forecast the popularity of music tracks. Our approach takes advantage of Spotify's wide range of features, including acoustic attributes based on the spectrogram of audio waveform, metadata, and user engagement metrics, to capture the complex patterns and relationships that influence a track's popularity. Using a large dataset covering various genres and demographics, our CNN-based model shows impressive effectiveness in predicting the popularity of music tracks. Additionally, we've conducted extensive experiments to assess the strength and adaptability of our model across different musical styles and time periods, with promising results yielding a 97\% F1 score. Our study not only offers valuable insights into the dynamic landscape of digital music consumption but also provides the music industry with advanced predictive tools for assessing and predicting the success of music tracks.

A major bottleneck lies in the twisted probability path of multi-modalities -- continuous 3D positions and discrete 2D topologies -- which jointly determine molecular geometries. By establishing the fact that noise schedules decide the Variational Lower Bound (VLB) for the twisted probability path, we propose VLB-Optimal Scheduling (VOS) strategy in this under-explored area, which optimizes VLB as a path integral for SBDD. Our model effectively enhances molecular geometries and interaction modeling, achieving state-of-the-art PoseBusters passing rate of 95.9% on CrossDock, more than 10% improvement upon strong baselines, while maintaining high affinities and robust intramolecular validity evaluated on held-out test set.

Abstract: The exponential growth in Large Language Model (LLM) deployment has intensified the need for efficient model compression techniques to reduce computational and memory costs. While pruning and quantization have shown promise, their combined potential remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine joint compression and how strategically combining pruning and quantization could yield superior performance-to-compression ratios compared to single-method approaches. Recognizing the challenges in accurately assessing LLM performance, we address key limitations of previous evaluation frameworks and introduce the Semantic Retention Compression Rate (SrCr), a novel metric that quantifies the trade-off between model compression and semantic preservation, facilitating the optimization of pruning-quantization configurations. Experiments demonstrate that our recommended combination achieves, on average, a 20% performance increase compared to an equivalent quantization-only model at the same theoretical compression rate.

Abstract: The human body demonstrates exceptional motor capabilities-such as standing steadily on one foot or performing a high kick with the leg raised over 1.5 meters-both requiring precise balance control. While recent research on humanoid control has leveraged reinforcement learning to track human motions for skill acquisition, applying this paradigm to balance-intensive tasks remains challenging. In this work, we identify three key obstacles: instability from reference motion errors, learning difficulties due to morphological mismatch, and the sim-to-real gap caused by sensor noise and unmodeled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose HuB (Humanoid Balance), a unified framework that integrates reference motion refinement, balance-aware policy learning, and sim-to-real robustness training, with each component targeting a specific challenge. We validate our approach on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot across challenging quasi-static balance tasks, including extreme single-legged poses such as Swallow Balance and Bruce Lee's Kick. Our policy remains stable even under strong physical disturbances-such as a forceful soccer strike-while baseline methods consistently fail to complete these tasks.

Abstract: Designing effective collaboration structure for multi-agent LLM systems to enhance collective reasoning is crucial yet remains under-explored. In this paper, we systematically investigate how collaborative reasoning performance is affected by three key design dimensions: (1) Expertise-Domain Alignment, (2) Collaboration Paradigm (structured workflow vs. diversity-driven integration), and (3) System Scale. Our findings reveal that expertise alignment benefits are highly domain-contingent, proving most effective for contextual reasoning tasks. Furthermore, collaboration focused on integrating diverse knowledge consistently outperforms rigid task decomposition. Finally, we empirically explore the impact of scaling the multi-agent system with expertise specialization and study the computational trade off, highlighting the need for more efficient communication protocol design. This work provides concrete guidelines for configuring specialized multi-agent system and identifies critical architectural trade-offs and bottlenecks for scalable multi-agent reasoning. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the ever-growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), AI-based software and its negative impact on the environment are no longer negligible, and studying and mitigating this impact has become a critical area of research. However, it is currently unclear which role environmental sustainability plays during AI adoption in industry and how AI regulations influence Green AI practices and decision-making in industry. We therefore aim to investigate the Green AI perception and management of industry practitioners. To this end, we conducted a total of 11 interviews with participants from 10 different organizations that adopted AI-based software. The interviews explored three main themes: AI adoption, current efforts in mitigating the negative environmental impact of AI, and the influence of the EU AI Act and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Our findings indicate that 9 of 11 participants prioritized business efficiency during AI adoption, with minimal consideration of environmental sustainability. Monitoring and mitigation of AI's environmental impact were very limited. Only one participant monitored negative environmental effects. Regarding applied mitigation practices, six participants reported no actions, with the others sporadically mentioning techniques like prompt engineering, relying on smaller models, or not overusing AI. Awareness and compliance with the EU AI Act are low, with only one participant reporting on its influence, while the CSRD drove sustainability reporting efforts primarily in larger companies. All in all, our findings reflect a lack of urgency and priority for sustainable AI among these companies. We suggest that current regulations are not very effective, which has implications for policymakers. Additionally, there is a need to raise industry awareness, but also to provide user-friendly techniques and tools for Green AI practices.

Abstract: Medical research, particularly in predicting patient outcomes, heavily relies on medical time series data extracted from Electronic Health Records (EHR), which provide extensive information on patient histories. Despite rigorous examination, labeling errors are inevitable and can significantly impede accurate predictions of patient outcome. To address this challenge, we propose an \textbf{A}ttention-based Learning Framework with Dynamic \textbf{C}alibration and Augmentation for \textbf{T}ime series Noisy \textbf{L}abel \textbf{L}earning (ACTLL). This framework leverages a two-component Beta mixture model to identify the certain and uncertain sets of instances based on the fitness distribution of each class, and it captures global temporal dynamics while dynamically calibrating labels from the uncertain set or augmenting confident instances from the certain set. Experimental results on large-scale EHR datasets eICU and MIMIC-IV-ED, and several benchmark datasets from the UCR and UEA repositories, demonstrate that our model ACTLL has achieved state-of-the-art performance, especially under high noise levels.

Abstract: Background subtraction (BGS) is utilized to detect moving objects in a video and is commonly employed at the onset of object tracking and human recognition processes. Nevertheless, existing BGS techniques utilizing deep learning still encounter challenges with various background noises in videos, including variations in lighting, shifts in camera angles, and disturbances like air turbulence or swaying trees. To address this problem, we design a spiking autoencoder network, termed SAEN-BGS, based on noise resilience and time-sequence sensitivity of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to enhance the separation of foreground and background. To eliminate unnecessary background noise and preserve the important foreground elements, we begin by creating the continuous spiking conv-and-dconv block, which serves as the fundamental building block for the decoder in SAEN-BGS. Moreover, in striving for enhanced energy efficiency, we introduce a novel self-distillation spiking supervised learning method grounded in ANN-to-SNN frameworks, resulting in decreased power consumption. In extensive experiments conducted on CDnet-2014 and DAVIS-2016 datasets, our approach demonstrates superior segmentation performance relative to other baseline methods, even when challenged by complex scenarios with dynamic backgrounds.

Abstract: Affirmative algorithms have emerged as a potential answer to algorithmic discrimination, seeking to redress past harms and rectify the source of historical injustices. We present the results of two experiments ($N$$=$$1193$) capturing laypeople's perceptions of affirmative algorithms -- those which explicitly prioritize the historically marginalized -- in hiring and criminal justice. We contrast these opinions about affirmative algorithms with folk attitudes towards algorithms that prioritize the privileged (i.e., discriminatory) and systems that make decisions independently of demographic groups (i.e., fair). We find that people -- regardless of their political leaning and identity -- view fair algorithms favorably and denounce discriminatory systems. In contrast, we identify disagreements concerning affirmative algorithms: liberals and racial minorities rate affirmative systems as positively as their fair counterparts, whereas conservatives and those from the dominant racial group evaluate affirmative algorithms as negatively as discriminatory systems. We identify a source of these divisions: people have varying beliefs about who (if anyone) is marginalized, shaping their views of affirmative algorithms. We discuss the possibility of bridging these disagreements to bring people together towards affirmative algorithms.

Abstract: In this work, we present GPDiT, a Generative Pre-trained Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer that unifies the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive modeling for long-range video synthesis, within a continuous latent space. Instead of predicting discrete tokens, GPDiT autoregressively predicts future latent frames using a diffusion loss, enabling natural modeling of motion dynamics and semantic consistency across frames. This continuous autoregressive framework not only enhances generation quality but also endows the model with representation capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight causal attention variant and a parameter-free rotation-based time-conditioning mechanism, improving both the training and inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPDiT achieves strong performance in video generation quality, video representation ability, and few-shot learning tasks, highlighting its potential as an effective framework for video modeling in continuous space.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for relevance assessment in information retrieval. However, our study demonstrates that combining two distinct small language models (SLMs) with different architectures can outperform LLMs in this task. Our approach -- QUPID -- integrates a generative SLM with an embedding-based SLM, achieving higher relevance judgment accuracy while reducing computational costs compared to state-of-the-art LLM solutions. This computational efficiency makes QUPID highly scalable for real-world search systems processing millions of queries daily. In experiments across diverse document types, our method demonstrated consistent performance improvements (Cohen's Kappa of 0.646 versus 0.387 for leading LLMs) while offering 60x faster inference times. Furthermore, when integrated into production search pipelines, QUPID improved nDCG@5 scores by 1.9%. These findings underscore how architectural diversity in model combinations can significantly enhance both search relevance and operational efficiency in information retrieval systems.

Abstract: Background and Objective. Research in the cross-modal medical image translation domain has been very productive over the past few years in tackling the scarce availability of large curated multimodality datasets with the promising performance of GAN-based architectures. However, only a few of these studies assessed task-based related performance of these synthetic data, especially for the training of deep models. Method. We design and compare different GAN-based frameworks for generating synthetic brain [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images from T1 weighted MRI data. We first perform standard qualitative and quantitative visual quality evaluation. Then, we explore further impact of using these fake PET data in the training of a deep unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) model designed to detect subtle epilepsy lesions in T1 MRI and FDG PET images. We introduce novel diagnostic task-oriented quality metrics of the synthetic FDG PET data tailored to our unsupervised detection task, then use these fake data to train a use case UAD model combining a deep representation learning based on siamese autoencoders with a OC-SVM density support estimation model. This model is trained on normal subjects only and allows the detection of any variation from the pattern of the normal population. We compare the detection performance of models trained on 35 paired real MR T1 of normal subjects paired either on 35 true PET images or on 35 synthetic PET images generated from the best performing generative models. Performance analysis is conducted on 17 exams of epilepsy patients undergoing surgery. Results. The best performing GAN-based models allow generating realistic fake PET images of control subject with SSIM and PSNR values around 0.9 and 23.8, respectively and in distribution (ID) with regard to the true control dataset. The best UAD model trained on these synthetic normative PET data allows reaching 74% sensitivity. Conclusion. Our results confirm that GAN-based models are the best suited for MR T1 to FDG PET translation, outperforming transformer or diffusion models. We also demonstrate the diagnostic value of these synthetic data for the training of UAD models and evaluation on clinical exams of epilepsy patients. Our code and the normative image dataset are available.

Abstract: We present Task 5 of the DCASE 2025 Challenge: an Audio Question Answering (AQA) benchmark spanning multiple domains of sound understanding. This task defines three QA subsets (Bioacoustics, Temporal Soundscapes, and Complex QA) to test audio-language models on interactive question-answering over diverse acoustic scenes. We describe the dataset composition (from marine mammal calls to soundscapes and complex real-world clips), the evaluation protocol (top-1 accuracy with answer-shuffling robustness), and baseline systems (Qwen2-Audio-7B, AudioFlamingo 2, Gemini-2-Flash). Preliminary results on the development set are compared, showing strong variation across models and subsets. This challenge aims to advance the audio understanding and reasoning capabilities of audio-language models toward human-level acuity, which are crucial for enabling AI agents to perceive and interact about the world effectively.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for enhancing Automated Program Repair (APR) through synthetic data generation utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). Current APR systems are constrained by the limited availability of high-quality training data encompassing diverse bug types across multiple programming languages. The proposed approach addresses this limitation through a two-phase process: a synthetic sample generation followed by a rigorous quality assessment. Multiple state-of-the-art LLMs were employed to generate approximately 30,000 paired examples of buggy and fixed code across 12 programming languages and 13 bug categories. Subsequently, these samples underwent cross-model evaluation against five criteria: correctness, code quality, security, performance, and completeness. Experimental evaluation on the VulRepair test set dataset showed statistically significant improvements in Perfect Prediction rates, with the quality-filtered synthetic dataset outperforming both baseline and real-world commit data configurations in certain scenarios. The methodology was validated through rigorous statistical testing, including ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's Honest Significant Difference analysis. Furthermore, the best-performing configurations surpassed existing systems despite using a less computationally intensive decoding strategy. This research establishes a self-bootstrapping paradigm in which LLMs generate and evaluate their own training data, potentially transforming approaches to data scarcity across software engineering tasks and advancing the development of robust, adaptable tools for automated code maintenance.

Abstract: Transforming educational technologies through the integration of large language models (LLMs) and virtual reality (VR) offers the potential for immersive and interactive learning experiences. However, the effects of LLMs on user engagement and attention in educational environments remain open questions. In this study, we utilized a fully LLM-driven virtual learning environment, where peers and teachers were LLM-driven, to examine how students behaved in such settings. Specifically, we investigate how peer question-asking behaviors influenced student engagement, attention, cognitive load, and learning outcomes and found that, in conditions where LLM-driven peer learners asked questions, students exhibited more targeted visual scanpaths, with their attention directed toward the learning content, particularly in complex subjects. Our results suggest that peer questions did not introduce extraneous cognitive load directly, as the cognitive load is strongly correlated with increased attention to the learning material. Considering these findings, we provide design recommendations for optimizing VR learning spaces.

Abstract: With the continuous increase in the number and resolution of video surveillance cameras, the burden of transmitting and storing surveillance video is growing. Traditional communication methods based on Shannon's theory are facing optimization bottlenecks. Semantic communication, as an emerging communication method, is expected to break through this bottleneck and reduce the storage and transmission consumption of video. Existing semantic decoding methods often require many samples to train the neural network for each scene, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, a semantic encoding and decoding method for surveillance video is proposed. First, the sketch was extracted as semantic information, and a sketch compression method was proposed to reduce the bit rate of semantic information. Then, an image translation network was proposed to translate the sketch into a video frame with a reference frame. Finally, a few-shot sketch decoding network was proposed to reconstruct video from sketch. Experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved significantly better video reconstruction performance than baseline methods. The sketch compression method could effectively reduce the storage and transmission consumption of semantic information with little compromise on video quality. The proposed method provides a novel semantic encoding and decoding method that only needs a few training samples for each surveillance scene, thus improving the practicality of the semantic communication system.

Abstract: In November 2022, Europe and the world by and large were stunned by the birth of a new large language model : ChatGPT. Ever since then, both academic and populist discussions have taken place in various public spheres such as LinkedIn and X(formerly known as Twitter) with the view to both understand the tool and its benefits for the society. The views of real actors in professional spaces, especially in regulated industries such as finance and law have been largely missing. We aim to begin to close this gap by presenting results from an empirical investigation conducted through interviews with professional actors in the Fintech industry. The paper asks the question, how and to what extent are large language models in general and ChatGPT in particular being adopted and used in the Fintech industry? The results show that while the fintech experts we spoke with see a potential in using large language models in the future, a lot of questions marks remain concerning how they are policed and therefore might be adopted in a regulated industry such as Fintech. This paper aims to add to the existing academic discussing around large language models, with a contribution to our understanding of professional viewpoints.

Abstract: Instruction tuning has emerged as a critical paradigm for improving the capabilities and alignment of large language models (LLMs). However, existing iterative model-aware data selection methods incur significant computational overhead, as they rely on repeatedly performing full-dataset model inference to estimate sample utility for subsequent training iterations, creating a fundamental efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose LEAD, an efficient iterative data selection framework that accurately estimates sample utility entirely within the standard training loop, eliminating the need for costly additional model inference. At its core, LEAD introduces Instance-Level Dynamic Uncertainty (IDU), a theoretically grounded utility function combining instantaneous training loss, gradient-based approximation of loss changes, and exponential smoothing of historical loss signals. To further scale efficiently to large datasets, LEAD employs a two-stage, coarse-to-fine selection strategy, adaptively prioritizing informative clusters through a multi-armed bandit mechanism, followed by precise fine-grained selection of high-utility samples using IDU. Extensive experiments across four diverse benchmarks show that LEAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving average model performance by 6.1%-10.8% while using only 2.5% of the training data and reducing overall training time by 5-10x.

Abstract: Recent advances in continuous generative models, including multi-step approaches like diffusion and flow-matching (typically requiring 8-1000 sampling steps) and few-step methods such as consistency models (typically 1-8 steps), have demonstrated impressive generative performance. However, existing work often treats these approaches as distinct paradigms, resulting in separate training and sampling methodologies. We introduce a unified framework for training, sampling, and analyzing these models. Our implementation, the Unified Continuous Generative Models Trainer and Sampler (UCGM-{T,S}), achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256 using a 675M diffusion transformer, UCGM-T trains a multi-step model achieving 1.30 FID in 20 steps and a few-step model reaching 1.42 FID in just 2 steps. Additionally, applying UCGM-S to a pre-trained model (previously 1.26 FID at 250 steps) improves performance to 1.06 FID in only 40 steps. Code is available at: https://github.com/LINs-lab/UCGM.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to learn a sequence of tasks without forgetting prior knowledge, but gradient updates for a new task often overwrite the weights learned earlier, causing catastrophic forgetting (CF). We propose Prototype-Augmented Hypernetworks (PAH), a framework where a single hypernetwork, conditioned on learnable task prototypes, dynamically generates task-specific classifier heads on demand. To mitigate forgetting, PAH combines cross-entropy with dual distillation losses, one to align logits and another to align prototypes, ensuring stable feature representations across tasks. Evaluations on Split-CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet demonstrate that PAH achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 74.5 % and 63.7 % accuracy with only 1.7 % and 4.4 % forgetting, respectively, surpassing prior methods without storing samples or heads.

Abstract: We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to replicate human behavior in economic market experiments. Compared to previous studies, we focus on dynamic feedback between LLM agents: the decisions of each LLM impact the market price at the current step, and so affect the decisions of the other LLMs at the next step. We compare LLM behavior to market dynamics observed in laboratory settings and assess their alignment with human participants' behavior. Our findings indicate that LLMs do not adhere strictly to rational expectations, displaying instead bounded rationality, similarly to human participants. Providing a minimal context window i.e. memory of three previous time steps, combined with a high variability setting capturing response heterogeneity, allows LLMs to replicate broad trends seen in human experiments, such as the distinction between positive and negative feedback markets. However, differences remain at a granular level--LLMs exhibit less heterogeneity in behavior than humans. These results suggest that LLMs hold promise as tools for simulating realistic human behavior in economic contexts, though further research is needed to refine their accuracy and increase behavioral diversity.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection is a popular and vital task in various real-world scenarios, which has been studied for several decades. Recently, many studies extending deep learning-based methods have shown preferable performance on graph anomaly detection. However, existing methods are lack of efficiency that is definitely necessary for embedded devices. Towards this end, we propose an Efficient Anomaly detection model on heterogeneous Graphs via contrastive LEarning (EAGLE) by contrasting abnormal nodes with normal ones in terms of their distances to the local context. The proposed method first samples instance pairs on meta path-level for contrastive learning. Then, a graph autoencoder-based model is applied to learn informative node embeddings in an unsupervised way, which will be further combined with the discriminator to predict the anomaly scores of nodes. Experimental results show that EAGLE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three heterogeneous network datasets.

Abstract: Interactive medical segmentation reduces annotation effort by refining predictions through user feedback. Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), achieve state-of-the-art performance using user clicks and prior masks as prompts. However, existing methods treat interactions as independent events, leading to redundant corrections and limited refinement gains. We address this by introducing MAIS, a Memory-Attention mechanism for Interactive Segmentation that stores past user inputs and segmentation states, enabling temporal context integration. Our approach enhances ViT-based segmentation across diverse imaging modalities, achieving more efficient and accurate refinements.

Abstract: The tool-using capability of large language models (LLMs) enables them to access up-to-date external information and handle complex tasks. Current approaches to enhancing this capability primarily rely on distilling advanced models by data synthesis. However, this method incurs significant costs associated with advanced model usage and often results in data compatibility issues, led by the high discrepancy in the knowledge scope between the advanced model and the target model. To address these challenges, we propose ToolACE-DEV, a self-improving framework for tool learning. First, we decompose the tool-learning objective into sub-tasks that enhance basic tool-making and tool-using abilities. Then, we introduce a self-evolving paradigm that allows lightweight models to self-improve, reducing reliance on advanced LLMs. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach across models of varying scales and architectures.

Abstract: Monitoring and analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, even under varying physiological conditions, including those influenced by physical activity, drugs and stress, is crucial to accurately assess cardiac health. However, current AI-based methods often fail to account for how these factors interact and alter ECG patterns, ultimately limiting their applicability in real-world settings. This study introduces IKrNet, a novel neural network model, which identifies drug-specific patterns in ECGs amidst certain physiological conditions. IKrNet's architecture incorporates spatial and temporal dynamics by using a convolutional backbone with varying receptive field size to capture spatial features. A bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory module is also employed to model temporal dependencies. By treating heart rate variability as a surrogate for physiological fluctuations, we evaluated IKrNet's performance across diverse scenarios, including conditions with physical stress, drug intake alone, and a baseline without drug presence. Our assessment follows a clinical protocol in which 990 healthy volunteers were administered 80mg of Sotalol, a drug which is known to be a precursor to Torsades-de-Pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia. We show that IKrNet outperforms state-of-the-art models' accuracy and stability in varying physiological conditions, underscoring its clinical viability.

Abstract: Visual Analytics (VA) integrates humans, data, and models as key actors in insight generation and data-driven decision-making. This position paper values and reflects on 16 VA process models and frameworks and makes nine high-level observations that motivate a fresh perspective on VA. The contribution is the HDMI Canvas, a perspective to VA that complements the strengths of existing VA process models and frameworks. It systematically characterizes diverse roles of humans, data, and models, and how these actors benefit from and contribute to VA processes. The descriptive power of the HDMI Canvas eases the differentiation between a series of VA building blocks, rather than describing general VA principles only. The canvas includes modern human-centered methodologies, including human knowledge externalization and forms of feedback loops, while interpretable and explainable AI highlight model contributions beyond their conventional outputs. The HDMI Canvas has generative power, guiding the design of new VA processes and is optimized for external stakeholders, improving VA outreach, interdisciplinary collaboration, and user-centered design. The utility of the HDMI Canvas is demonstrated through two preliminary case studies.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge from retrieved documents, thereby overcoming the limitations of models' static intrinsic knowledge. However, these systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks that manipulate the retrieval process by introducing documents that are adversarial yet semantically similar to the query. Notably, while these adversarial documents resemble the query, they exhibit weak similarity to benign documents in the retrieval set. Thus, we propose a simple yet effective Graph-based Reranking against Adversarial Document Attacks (GRADA) framework aiming at preserving retrieval quality while significantly reducing the success of adversaries. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of our approach through experiments conducted on five LLMs: GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, Llama3.1-8b, Llama3.1-70b, and Qwen2.5-7b. We use three datasets to assess performance, with results from the Natural Questions dataset demonstrating up to an 80% reduction in attack success rates while maintaining minimal loss in accuracy.

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a cornerstone of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), yet the scarcity of High-Confidence Pseudo-Labeled Target Domain Samples (\textbf{hcpl-tds}) often leads to inaccurate cross-domain statistical alignment, causing DA failures. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{N}oise \textbf{O}ptimized \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{D}iffusion for \textbf{D}omain \textbf{A}daptation (\textbf{NOCDDA}), which seamlessly integrates the generative capabilities of conditional diffusion models with the decision-making requirements of DA to achieve task-coupled optimization for efficient adaptation. For robust cross-domain consistency, we modify the DA classifier to align with the conditional diffusion classifier within a unified optimization framework, enabling forward training on noise-varying cross-domain samples. Furthermore, we argue that the conventional \( \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I}) \) initialization in diffusion models often generates class-confused hcpl-tds, compromising discriminative DA. To resolve this, we introduce a class-aware noise optimization strategy that refines sampling regions for reverse class-specific hcpl-tds generation, effectively enhancing cross-domain alignment. Extensive experiments across 5 benchmark datasets and 29 DA tasks demonstrate significant performance gains of \textbf{NOCDDA} over 31 state-of-the-art methods, validating its robustness and effectiveness.

Abstract: Teachers' visual attention and its distribution across the students in classrooms can constitute important implications for student engagement, achievement, and professional teacher training. Despite that, inferring the information about where and which student teachers focus on is not trivial. Mobile eye tracking can provide vital help to solve this issue; however, the use of mobile eye tracking alone requires a significant amount of manual annotations. To address this limitation, we present an automated processing pipeline concept that requires minimal manually annotated data to recognize which student the teachers focus on. To this end, we utilize state-of-the-art face detection models and face recognition feature embeddings to train face recognition models with transfer learning in the classroom context and combine these models with the teachers' gaze from mobile eye trackers. We evaluated our approach with data collected from four different classrooms, and our results show that while it is possible to estimate the visually focused students with reasonable performance in all of our classroom setups, U-shaped and small classrooms led to the best results with accuracies of approximately 0.7 and 0.9, respectively. While we did not evaluate our method for teacher-student interactions and focused on the validity of the technical approach, as our methodology does not require a vast amount of manually annotated data and offers a non-intrusive way of handling teachers' visual attention, it could help improve instructional strategies, enhance classroom management, and provide feedback for professional teacher development.

Abstract: This short paper explores how a maritime company develops and integrates large-language models (LLM). Specifically by looking at the requirements engineering for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in expert settings. Through a case study at a maritime service provider, we demonstrate how data scientists face a fundamental tension between user expectations of AI perfection and the correctness of the generated outputs. Our findings reveal that data scientists must identify context-specific "retrieval requirements" through iterative experimentation together with users because they are the ones who can determine correctness. We present an empirical process model describing how data scientists practically elicited these "retrieval requirements" and managed system limitations. This work advances software engineering knowledge by providing insights into the specialized requirements engineering processes for implementing RAG systems in complex domain-specific applications.

Abstract: Kidney abnormality segmentation has important potential to enhance the clinical workflow, especially in settings requiring quantitative assessments. Kidney volume could serve as an important biomarker for renal diseases, with changes in volume correlating directly with kidney function. Currently, clinical practice often relies on subjective visual assessment for evaluating kidney size and abnormalities, including tumors and cysts, which are typically staged based on diameter, volume, and anatomical location. To support a more objective and reproducible approach, this research aims to develop a robust, thoroughly validated kidney abnormality segmentation algorithm, made publicly available for clinical and research use. We employ publicly available training datasets and leverage the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation framework nnU-Net. Validation is conducted using both proprietary and public test datasets, with segmentation performance quantified by Dice coefficient and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance. Furthermore, we analyze robustness across subgroups based on patient sex, age, CT contrast phases, and tumor histologic subtypes. Our findings demonstrate that our segmentation algorithm, trained exclusively on publicly available data, generalizes effectively to external test sets and outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across all tested datasets. Subgroup analyses reveal consistent high performance, indicating strong robustness and reliability. The developed algorithm and associated code are publicly accessible at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/oncology-kidney-abnormality-segmentation.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is a complex, multistage process. Automated visual inspection of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images is indispensable for minimizing equipment downtime and containing costs. Most previous research considers supervised approaches, assuming a sufficient number of anomalously labeled samples. On the contrary, Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD), an emerging research domain, focuses on unsupervised learning, avoiding the costly defect collection phase while providing explanations of the predictions. We introduce a benchmark for VAD in the semiconductor domain by leveraging the MIIC dataset. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of modern VAD approaches in this field.

Abstract: Instruction following evaluates large language models (LLMs) on their ability to generate outputs that adhere to user-defined constraints. However, existing benchmarks often rely on templated constraint prompts, which lack the diversity of real-world usage and limit fine-grained performance assessment. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-dimensional constraint framework encompassing three constraint patterns, four constraint categories, and four difficulty levels. Building on this framework, we develop an automated instruction generation pipeline that performs constraint expansion, conflict detection, and instruction rewriting, yielding 1,200 code-verifiable instruction-following test samples. We evaluate 19 LLMs across seven model families and uncover substantial variation in performance across constraint forms. For instance, average performance drops from 77.67% at Level I to 32.96% at Level IV. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our approach by using it to generate data for reinforcement learning, achieving substantial gains in instruction following without degrading general performance. In-depth analysis indicates that these gains stem primarily from modifications in the model's attention modules parameters, which enhance constraint recognition and adherence. Code and data are available in https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/MulDimIF.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a common strategy to reduce hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL) can enable LLMs to act as search agents by activating retrieval capabilities, existing ones often underutilize their internal knowledge. This can lead to redundant retrievals, potential harmful knowledge conflicts, and increased inference latency. To address these limitations, an efficient and adaptive search agent capable of discerning optimal retrieval timing and synergistically integrating parametric (internal) and retrieved (external) knowledge is in urgent need. This paper introduces the Reinforced Internal-External Knowledge Synergistic Reasoning Agent (IKEA), which could indentify its own knowledge boundary and prioritize the utilization of internal knowledge, resorting to external search only when internal knowledge is deemed insufficient. This is achieved using a novel knowledge-boundary aware reward function and a knowledge-boundary aware training dataset. These are designed for internal-external knowledge synergy oriented RL, incentivizing the model to deliver accurate answers, minimize unnecessary retrievals, and encourage appropriate external searches when its own knowledge is lacking. Evaluations across multiple knowledge reasoning tasks demonstrate that IKEA significantly outperforms baseline methods, reduces retrieval frequency significantly, and exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Detective fiction, a genre defined by its complex narrative structures and character-driven storytelling, presents unique challenges for computational narratology, a research field focused on integrating literary theory into automated narrative generation. While traditional literary studies have offered deep insights into the methods and archetypes of fictional detectives, these analyses often focus on a limited number of characters and lack the scalability needed for the extraction of unique traits that can be used to guide narrative generation methods. In this paper, we present an AI-driven approach for systematically characterizing the investigative methods of fictional detectives. Our multi-phase workflow explores the capabilities of 15 Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract, synthesize, and validate distinctive investigative traits of fictional detectives. This approach was tested on a diverse set of seven iconic detectives - Hercule Poirot, Sherlock Holmes, William Murdoch, Columbo, Father Brown, Miss Marple, and Auguste Dupin - capturing the distinctive investigative styles that define each character. The identified traits were validated against existing literary analyses and further tested in a reverse identification phase, achieving an overall accuracy of 91.43%, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in capturing the distinctive investigative approaches of each detective. This work contributes to the broader field of computational narratology by providing a scalable framework for character analysis, with potential applications in AI-driven interactive storytelling and automated narrative generation.

Abstract: We present MiMo-7B, a large language model born for reasoning tasks, with optimization across both pre-training and post-training stages. During pre-training, we enhance the data preprocessing pipeline and employ a three-stage data mixing strategy to strengthen the base model's reasoning potential. MiMo-7B-Base is pre-trained on 25 trillion tokens, with additional Multi-Token Prediction objective for enhanced performance and accelerated inference speed. During post-training, we curate a dataset of 130K verifiable mathematics and programming problems for reinforcement learning, integrating a test-difficulty-driven code-reward scheme to alleviate sparse-reward issues and employing strategic data resampling to stabilize training. Extensive evaluations show that MiMo-7B-Base possesses exceptional reasoning potential, outperforming even much larger 32B models. The final RL-tuned model, MiMo-7B-RL, achieves superior performance on mathematics, code and general reasoning tasks, surpassing the performance of OpenAI o1-mini.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become widely deployed, concerns about their safety and alignment grow. An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as mitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts of a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output. Token-level attribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text generation, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately, rather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response. We introduce ConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies the concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them importance based on the outputs' semantic similarity. Unlike current token-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through in-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g., gender bias. ConceptX enables both auditing, by uncovering sources of bias, and steering, by modifying prompts to shift the sentiment or reduce the harmfulness of LLM responses, without requiring retraining. Across three LLMs, ConceptX outperforms token-level methods like TokenSHAP in both faithfulness and human alignment. Steering tasks boost sentiment shift by 0.252 versus 0.131 for random edits and lower attack success rates from 0.463 to 0.242, outperforming attribution and paraphrasing baselines. While prompt engineering and self-explaining methods sometimes yield safer responses, ConceptX offers a transparent and faithful alternative for improving LLM safety and alignment, demonstrating the practical value of attribution-based explainability in guiding LLM behavior.

Abstract: Text-to-audio models have recently emerged as a powerful technology for generating sound from textual descriptions. However, their high computational demands raise concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of the energy usage of 7 state-of-the-art text-to-audio diffusion-based generative models, evaluating to what extent variations in generation parameters affect energy consumption at inference time. We also aim to identify an optimal balance between audio quality and energy consumption by considering Pareto-optimal solutions across all selected models. Our findings provide insights into the trade-offs between performance and environmental impact, contributing to the development of more efficient generative audio models.

Abstract: Vector databases have emerged as a new type of systems that support efficient querying of high-dimensional vectors. Many of these offer their database as a service in the cloud. However, the variety of available CPUs and the lack of vector search benchmarks across CPUs make it difficult for users to choose one. In this study, we show that CPU microarchitectures available in the cloud perform significantly differently across vector search scenarios. For instance, in an IVF index on float32 vectors, AMD's Zen4 gives almost 3x more queries per second (QPS) compared to Intel's Sapphire Rapids, but for HNSW indexes, the tables turn. However, when looking at the number of queries per dollar (QP$), Graviton3 is the best option for most indexes and quantization settings, even over Graviton4 (Table 1). With this work, we hope to guide users in getting the best "bang for the buck" when deploying vector search systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has shifted from static, data-driven models to dynamic systems capable of perceiving and interacting with real-world environments. Despite advancements in pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design, enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and (2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing, perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level intelligence in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Human cognition is deeply intertwined with a sense of time, known as Chronoception. This sense allows us to judge how long facts remain valid and when knowledge becomes outdated. Despite progress in vision, language, and motor control, AI still struggles to reason about temporal validity. We introduce Chronocept, the first benchmark to model temporal validity as a continuous probability distribution over time. Using skew-normal curves fitted along semantically decomposed temporal axes, Chronocept captures nuanced patterns of emergence, decay, and peak relevance. It includes two datasets: Benchmark I (atomic facts) and Benchmark II (multi-sentence passages). Annotations show strong inter-annotator agreement (84% and 89%). Our baselines predict curve parameters - location, scale, and skewness - enabling interpretable, generalizable learning and outperforming classification-based approaches. Chronocept fills a foundational gap in AI's temporal reasoning, supporting applications in knowledge grounding, fact-checking, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and proactive agents. Code and data are publicly available.

Abstract: The broad availability of generative AI offers new opportunities to support various work domains, including agile software development. Agile epics are a key artifact for product managers to communicate requirements to stakeholders. However, in practice, they are often poorly defined, leading to churn, delivery delays, and cost overruns. In this industry case study, we investigate opportunities for large language models (LLMs) to evaluate agile epic quality in a global company. Results from a user study with 17 product managers indicate how LLM evaluations could be integrated into their work practices, including perceived values and usage in improving their epics. High levels of satisfaction indicate that agile epics are a new, viable application of AI evaluations. However, our findings also outline challenges, limitations, and adoption barriers that can inform both practitioners and researchers on the integration of such evaluations into future agile work practices.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, particularly in scientific domains that demand specialized and dynamic information. Despite its promise, the application of RAG in the chemistry domain remains underexplored, primarily due to the lack of high-quality, domain-specific corpora and well-curated evaluation benchmarks. In this work, we introduce ChemRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess the effectiveness of RAG across a diverse set of chemistry-related tasks. The accompanying chemistry corpus integrates heterogeneous knowledge sources, including scientific literature, the PubChem database, PubMed abstracts, textbooks, and Wikipedia entries. In addition, we present ChemRAG-Toolkit, a modular and extensible RAG toolkit that supports five retrieval algorithms and eight LLMs. Using ChemRAG-Toolkit, we demonstrate that RAG yields a substantial performance gain -- achieving an average relative improvement of 17.4% over direct inference methods. We further conduct in-depth analyses on retriever architectures, corpus selection, and the number of retrieved passages, culminating in practical recommendations to guide future research and deployment of RAG systems in the chemistry domain. The code and data is available at https://chemrag.github.io.

Abstract: We present OnPrem.LLM, a Python-based toolkit for applying large language models (LLMs) to sensitive, non-public data in offline or restricted environments. The system is designed for privacy-preserving use cases and provides prebuilt pipelines for document processing and storage, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), information extraction, summarization, classification, and prompt/output processing with minimal configuration. OnPrem.LLM supports multiple LLM backends -- including llama.cpp, Ollama, vLLM, and Hugging Face Transformers -- with quantized model support, GPU acceleration, and seamless backend switching. Although designed for fully local execution, OnPrem.LLM also supports integration with a wide range of cloud LLM providers when permitted, enabling hybrid deployments that balance performance with data control. A no-code web interface extends accessibility to non-technical users.

<title>Simple Semi-supervised Knowledge Distillation from Vision-Language Models via $\mathbf{\texttt{D}}$ual-$\mathbf{\texttt{H}}$ead $\mathbf{\texttt{O}}$ptimization</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks by leveraging rich textual information with minimal labeled data. However, deploying such large models remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a well-established solution to this problem; however, recent KD approaches from VLMs often involve multi-stage training or additional tuning, increasing computational overhead and optimization complexity. In this paper, we propose $\mathbf{\texttt{D}}$ual-$\mathbf{\texttt{H}}$ead $\mathbf{\texttt{O}}$ptimization ($\mathbf{\texttt{DHO}}$) -- a simple yet effective KD framework that transfers knowledge from VLMs to compact, task-specific models in semi-supervised settings. Specifically, we introduce dual prediction heads that independently learn from labeled data and teacher predictions, and propose to linearly combine their outputs during inference. We observe that $\texttt{DHO}$ mitigates gradient conflicts between supervised and distillation signals, enabling more effective feature learning than single-head KD baselines. As a result, extensive experiments show that $\texttt{DHO}$ consistently outperforms baselines across multiple domains and fine-grained datasets. Notably, on ImageNet, it achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy by 3% and 0.1% with 1% and 10% labeled data, respectively, while using fewer parameters.

Abstract: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has enabled novel discoveries and served as a large-scale reference through its harmonized genomics, clinical, and image data. Prior studies have trained bespoke cancer survival prediction models from unimodal or multimodal TCGA data. A modern paradigm in biomedical deep learning is the development of foundation models (FMs) to derive meaningful feature embeddings, agnostic to a specific modeling task. Biomedical text especially has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we investigate the feasibility of training classical, multimodal survival models over zero-shot embeddings extracted by FMs. We show the ease and additive effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models. We demonstrate the benefit of including pathology report text and rigorously evaluate the effect of model-based text summarization and hallucination. Overall, we modernize survival modeling by leveraging FMs and information extraction from pathology reports.

Abstract: Recent works have shown that modelling raw waveform directly from text in an end-to-end (E2E) fashion produces more natural-sounding speech than traditional neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems based on a cascade or two-stage approach. However, current E2E state-of-the-art models are computationally complex and memory-consuming, making them unsuitable for real-time offline on-device applications in low-resource scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Lightweight E2E-TTS (LE2E) model that generates high-quality speech requiring minimal computational resources. We evaluate the proposed model on the LJSpeech dataset and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance while being up to $90\%$ smaller in terms of model parameters and $10\times$ faster in real-time-factor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed E2E training paradigm achieves better quality compared to an equivalent architecture trained in a two-stage approach. Our results suggest that LE2E is a promising approach for developing real-time, high quality, low-resource TTS applications for on-device applications.

<title>Circuit Partitioning Using Large Language Models for Quantum Compilation and Simulations</title>

Abstract: We are in the midst of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, where quantum computers are limited by noisy gates, some of which are more error-prone than others and can render the final computation incomprehensible. Quantum circuit compilation algorithms attempt to minimize these noisy gates when mapping quantum algorithms onto quantum hardware but face computational challenges that restrict their application to circuits with no more than 5-6 qubits, necessitating the need to partition large circuits before the application of noisy quantum gate minimization algorithms. The existing generation of these algorithms is heuristic in nature and does not account for downstream gate minimization tasks. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to change this and help improve quantum circuit partitions. This paper investigates the use of LLMs, such as Llama and Mistral, for partitioning quantum circuits by capitalizing on their abilities to understand and generate code, including QASM. Specifically, we teach LLMs to partition circuits using the quick partition approach of the Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit. Through experimental evaluations, we show that careful fine-tuning of open source LLMs enables us to obtain an accuracy of 53.4% for the partition task while over-the-shelf LLMs are unable to correctly partition circuits, using standard 1-shot and few-shot training approaches.

Abstract: Event-based object detection has gained increasing attention due to its advantages such as high temporal resolution, wide dynamic range, and asynchronous address-event representation. Leveraging these advantages, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, offering low energy consumption and rich spatiotemporal dynamics. To further enhance the performance of event-based object detection, this study proposes a novel hybrid spike vision Transformer (HsVT) model. The HsVT model integrates a spatial feature extraction module to capture local and global features, and a temporal feature extraction module to model time dependencies and long-term patterns in event sequences. This combination enables HsVT to capture spatiotemporal features, improving its capability to handle complex event-based object detection tasks. To support research in this area, we developed and publicly released The Fall Detection Dataset as a benchmark for event-based object detection tasks. This dataset, captured using an event-based camera, ensures facial privacy protection and reduces memory usage due to the event representation format. We evaluated the HsVT model on GEN1 and Fall Detection datasets across various model sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that HsVT achieves significant performance improvements in event detection with fewer parameters.

Abstract: Generalist imitation learning policies trained on large datasets show great promise for solving diverse manipulation tasks. However, to ensure generalization to different conditions, policies need to be trained with data collected across a large set of environmental factor variations (e.g., camera pose, table height, distractors) $-$ a prohibitively expensive undertaking, if done exhaustively. We introduce a principled method for deciding what data to collect and how much to collect for each factor by constructing factored scaling curves (FSC), which quantify how policy performance varies as data scales along individual or paired factors. These curves enable targeted data acquisition for the most influential factor combinations within a given budget. We evaluate the proposed method through extensive simulated and real-world experiments, across both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, and show that it boosts success rates in real-world tasks in new environments by up to 26% over existing data-collection strategies. We further demonstrate how factored scaling curves can effectively guide data collection using an offline metric, without requiring real-world evaluation at scale.

Abstract: Edge computing has emerged as a pivotal technology, offering significant advantages such as low latency, enhanced data security, and reduced reliance on centralized cloud infrastructure. These benefits are crucial for applications requiring real-time data processing or strict security measures. Despite these advantages, edge devices operating within edge clusters are often underutilized. This inefficiency is mainly due to the absence of a holistic performance profiling mechanism which can help dynamically adjust the desired system configuration for a given workload. Since edge computing environments involve a complex interplay between CPU frequency, power consumption, and application performance, a deeper understanding of these correlations is essential. By uncovering these relationships, it becomes possible to make informed decisions that enhance both computational efficiency and energy savings. To address this gap, this paper evaluates the power consumption and performance characteristics of a single processing node within an edge cluster using a synthetic microbenchmark by varying the workload size and CPU frequency. The results show how an optimal measure can lead to optimized usage of edge resources, given both performance and power consumption.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in code generation. However, LLM-generated code is still plagued with a wide range of functional errors, especially for complex programming tasks that LLMs have not seen before. Recent studies have shown that developers often struggle with inspecting and fixing incorrect code generated by LLMs, diminishing their productivity and trust in LLM-based code generation. Inspired by the mutual grounding theory in communication, we propose an interactive approach that leverages code comments as a medium for developers and LLMs to establish a shared understanding. Our approach facilitates iterative grounding by interleaving code generation, inline comment generation, and contextualized user feedback through editable comments to align generated code with developer intent. We evaluated our approach on two popular benchmarks and demonstrated that our approach significantly improved multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., 17.1% pass@1 improvement for code-davinci-002 on HumanEval. Furthermore, we conducted a user study with 12 participants in comparison to two baselines: (1) interacting with GitHub Copilot, and (2) interacting with a multi-step code generation paradigm called Multi-Turn Program Synthesis. Participants completed the given programming tasks 16.7% faster and with 10.5% improvement in task success rate when using our approach. Both results show that interactively refining code comments enables the collaborative establishment of mutual grounding, leading to more accurate code generation and higher developer confidence.

Abstract: Persuasion is a fundamental aspect of communication, influencing decision-making across diverse contexts, from everyday conversations to high-stakes scenarios such as politics, marketing, and law. The rise of conversational AI systems has significantly expanded the scope of persuasion, introducing both opportunities and risks. AI-driven persuasion can be leveraged for beneficial applications, but also poses threats through manipulation and unethical influence. Moreover, AI systems are not only persuaders, but also susceptible to persuasion, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks and bias reinforcement. Despite rapid advancements in AI-generated persuasive content, our understanding of what makes persuasion effective remains limited due to its inherently subjective and context-dependent nature. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of computational persuasion, structured around three key perspectives: (1) AI as a Persuader, which explores AI-generated persuasive content and its applications; (2) AI as a Persuadee, which examines AI's susceptibility to influence and manipulation; and (3) AI as a Persuasion Judge, which analyzes AI's role in evaluating persuasive strategies, detecting manipulation, and ensuring ethical persuasion. We introduce a taxonomy for computational persuasion research and discuss key challenges, including evaluating persuasiveness, mitigating manipulative persuasion, and developing responsible AI-driven persuasive systems. Our survey outlines future research directions to enhance the safety, fairness, and effectiveness of AI-powered persuasion while addressing the risks posed by increasingly capable language models.

Abstract: A recent trend in LLMs is developing recurrent sub-quadratic models that improve long-context processing efficiency. We investigate leading large long-context models, focusing on how their fixed-size recurrent memory affects their performance. Our experiments reveal that, even when these models are trained for extended contexts, their use of long contexts remains underutilized. Specifically, we demonstrate that a chunk-based inference procedure, which identifies and processes only the most relevant portion of the input can mitigate recurrent memory failures and be effective for many long-context tasks: On LongBench, our method improves the overall performance of Falcon3-Mamba-Inst-7B by 14%, Falcon-Mamba-Inst-7B by 28%, RecurrentGemma-IT-9B by 50%, and RWKV6-Finch-7B by 51%. Surprisingly, this simple approach also leads to state-of-the-art results in the challenging LongBench v2 benchmark, showing competitive performance with equivalent size Transformers. Furthermore, our findings raise questions about whether recurrent models genuinely exploit long-range dependencies, as our single-chunk strategy delivers stronger performance - even in tasks that presumably require cross-context relations.

Abstract: Continual Pre-Training (CPT) has become a popular and effective method to apply strong foundation models to specific downstream tasks. In this work, we explore the learning dynamics throughout the CPT process for large language models. We specifically focus on how general and downstream domain performance evolves at each training step, with domain performance measured via validation losses. We have observed that the CPT loss curve fundamentally characterizes the transition from one curve to another hidden curve, and could be described by decoupling the effects of distribution shift and learning rate annealing. We derive a CPT scaling law that combines the two factors, enabling the prediction of loss at any (continual) training steps and across learning rate schedules (LRS) in CPT. Our formulation presents a comprehensive understanding of several critical factors in CPT, including loss potential, peak learning rate, training steps, replay ratio, etc. Moreover, our approach can be adapted to customize training hyper-parameters to different CPT goals such as balancing general and domain-specific performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scaling law holds across various CPT datasets and training hyper-parameters.

Abstract: Generative models have shown great promise as trajectory planners, given their affinity to modeling complex distributions and guidable inference process. Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of various static word embeddings for Hungarian, including traditional models such as Word2Vec, FastText, as well as static embeddings derived from BERT-based models using different extraction methods. We evaluate these embeddings on both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks to provide a holistic view of their performance. For intrinsic evaluation, we employ a word analogy task, which assesses the embeddings ability to capture semantic and syntactic relationships. Our results indicate that traditional static embeddings, particularly FastText, excel in this task, achieving high accuracy and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) scores. Among the BERT-based models, the X2Static method for extracting static embeddings demonstrates superior performance compared to decontextualized and aggregate methods, approaching the effectiveness of traditional static embeddings. For extrinsic evaluation, we utilize a bidirectional LSTM model to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging tasks. The results reveal that embeddings derived from dynamic models, especially those extracted using the X2Static method, outperform purely static embeddings. Notably, ELMo embeddings achieve the highest accuracy in both NER and POS tagging tasks, underscoring the benefits of contextualized representations even when used in a static form. Our findings highlight the continued relevance of static word embeddings in NLP applications and the potential of advanced extraction methods to enhance the utility of BERT-based models. This piece of research contributes to the understanding of embedding performance in the Hungarian language and provides valuable insights for future developments in the field. The training scripts, evaluation codes, restricted vocabulary, and extracted embeddings will be made publicly available to support further research and reproducibility.

Abstract: Large-scale, diverse robot datasets have emerged as a promising path toward enabling dexterous manipulation policies to generalize to novel environments, but acquiring such datasets presents many challenges. While teleoperation provides high-fidelity datasets, its high cost limits its scalability. Instead, what if people could use their own hands, just as they do in everyday life, to collect data? In DexWild, a diverse team of data collectors uses their hands to collect hours of interactions across a multitude of environments and objects. To record this data, we create DexWild-System, a low-cost, mobile, and easy-to-use device. The DexWild learning framework co-trains on both human and robot demonstrations, leading to improved performance compared to training on each dataset individually. This combination results in robust robot policies capable of generalizing to novel environments, tasks, and embodiments with minimal additional robot-specific data. Experimental results demonstrate that DexWild significantly improves performance, achieving a 68.5% success rate in unseen environments-nearly four times higher than policies trained with robot data only-and offering 5.8x better cross-embodiment generalization.

Abstract: This paper gives a translation from the $\mu$-fragment of the graded modal $\mu$-calculus to a class of distributed message-passing automata. As a corollary, we obtain an alternative proof for a theorem from \cite{ahvonen_neurips} stating that recurrent graph neural networks working with reals and graded modal substitution calculus have the same expressive power in restriction to the logic monadic second-order logic MSO.

Abstract: Visuomotor policy learning has witnessed substantial progress in robotic manipulation, with recent approaches predominantly relying on generative models to model the action distribution. However, these methods often overlook the critical coupling between visual perception and action prediction. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion Policy}~(\textbf{H$^{\mathbf{3}}$DP})$, a novel visuomotor learning framework that explicitly incorporates hierarchical structures to strengthen the integration between visual features and action generation. H$^{3}$DP contains $\mathbf{3}$ levels of hierarchy: (1) depth-aware input layering that organizes RGB-D observations based on depth information; (2) multi-scale visual representations that encode semantic features at varying levels of granularity; and (3) a hierarchically conditioned diffusion process that aligns the generation of coarse-to-fine actions with corresponding visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H$^{3}$DP yields a $\mathbf{+27.5\%}$ average relative improvement over baselines across $\mathbf{44}$ simulation tasks and achieves superior performance in $\mathbf{4}$ challenging bimanual real-world manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Neural theorem proving combines large language models (LLMs) with proof assistants such as Lean, where the correctness of formal proofs can be rigorously verified, leaving no room for hallucination. With existing neural theorem provers pretrained on a fixed collection of data and offering valuable suggestions at times, it is challenging for them to continually prove novel theorems in a fully autonomous mode, where human insights may be critical. In this paper, we explore LLMs as copilots that assist humans in proving theorems. We introduce Lean Copilot, a general framework for running LLM inference natively in Lean. It enables programmers to build various LLM-based proof automation tools that integrate seamlessly into the workflow of Lean users. Lean users can use our pretrained models or bring their own ones that run either locally (with or without GPUs) or on the cloud. Using Lean Copilot, we build LLM-based tools that suggest proof steps, complete proof goals, and select relevant premises. Experimental results on the Mathematics in Lean textbook demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to existing rule-based proof automation in Lean (aesop). When assisting humans, Lean Copilot requires only 2.08 manually-entered proof steps on average (3.86 required by aesop); when automating the theorem proving process, Lean Copilot automates 74.2% proof steps on average, 85% better than aesop (40.1%). We open source all code and artifacts under a permissive MIT license to facilitate further research.

Abstract: In the mobile internet era, the Online Food Ordering Service (OFOS) emerges as an integral component of inclusive finance owing to the convenience it brings to people. OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: This paper presents a transformative framework for artificial neural networks over graded vector spaces, tailored to model hierarchical and structured data in fields like algebraic geometry and physics. By exploiting the algebraic properties of graded vector spaces, where features carry distinct weights, we extend classical neural networks with graded neurons, layers, and activation functions that preserve structural integrity. Grounded in group actions, representation theory, and graded algebra, our approach combines theoretical rigor with practical utility.
  We introduce graded neural architectures, loss functions prioritizing graded components, and equivariant extensions adaptable to diverse gradings. Case studies validate the framework's effectiveness, outperforming standard neural networks in tasks such as predicting invariants in weighted projective spaces and modeling supersymmetric systems.
  This work establishes a new frontier in machine learning, merging mathematical sophistication with interdisciplinary applications. Future challenges, including computational scalability and finite field extensions, offer rich opportunities for advancing this paradigm.

Abstract: We introduce CHARTOM, a visual theory-of-mind benchmark for multimodal large language models. CHARTOM consists of specially designed data visualizing charts. Given a chart, a language model needs to not only correctly comprehend the chart (the FACT question) but also judge if the chart will be misleading to a human reader (the MIND question). Both questions have significant societal benefits. We detail the construction of the CHARTOM benchmark including its calibration on human performance. We benchmark leading LLMs as of late 2024 - including GPT, Claude, Gemini, Qwen, Llama, and Llava - on the CHARTOM dataset and found that our benchmark was challenging to all of them, suggesting room for future large language models to improve.

By leveraging these advanced AI tools, the study explores their application across key areas such as automated compliance checking and building design assistance. The research highlights how Gen-AI can automate labor-intensive processes, significantly improving efficiency and reducing costs in building practices. The paper first discusses the two widely applied fundamental models-Transformer and Diffusion model-and summarizes current pathways for accessing Gen-AI models and the most common techniques for customizing them. It then explores applications for text generation, such as compliance checking, control support, data mining, and building simulation input file editing. Additionally, it examines image generation, including direct generation through diffusion models and indirect generation through language model-supported template creation based on existing Computer-Aided Design or other design tools with rendering. The paper concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the current capabilities of Gen-AI in the building industry, outlining future directions for research and development, with the goal of paving the way for smarter, more effective, and responsive design, construction, and operational practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GPTs, trained on vast datasets, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in language understanding, reasoning, and planning, achieving human-level performance in various tasks. Most studies focus on enhancing these models by training on ever-larger datasets to build more powerful foundation models. While training stronger models is important, enabling models to evolve during inference is equally crucial, a process we refer to as AI self-evolution. Unlike large-scale training, self-evolution may rely on limited data or interactions. Inspired by the columnar organization of the human cerebral cortex, we hypothesize that AI models could develop cognitive abilities and build internal representations through iterative interactions with their environment. To achieve this, models need long-term memory (LTM) to store and manage processed interaction data. LTM supports self-evolution by representing diverse experiences across environments and agents. In this report, we explore AI self-evolution and its potential to enhance models during inference. We examine LTM's role in lifelong learning, allowing models to evolve based on accumulated interactions. We outline the structure of LTM and the systems needed for effective data retention and representation. We also classify approaches for building personalized models with LTM data and show how these models achieve self-evolution through interaction. Using LTM, our multi-agent framework OMNE achieved first place on the GAIA benchmark, demonstrating LTM's potential for AI self-evolution. Finally, we present a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the importance of LTM for advancing AI technology and its practical applications.

<title>Learning Fair and Preferable Allocations through Neural Network</title>

Abstract: The fair allocation of indivisible resources is a fundamental problem. Existing research has developed various allocation mechanisms or algorithms to satisfy different fairness notions. For example, round robin (RR) was proposed to meet the fairness criterion known as envy-freeness up to one good (EF1). Expert algorithms without mathematical formulations are used in real-world resource allocation problems to find preferable outcomes for users. Therefore, we aim to design mechanisms that strictly satisfy good properties with replicating expert knowledge. However, this problem is challenging because such heuristic rules are often difficult to formalize mathematically, complicating their integration into theoretical frameworks. Additionally, formal algorithms struggle to find preferable outcomes, and directly replicating these implicit rules can result in unfair allocations because human decision-making can introduce biases. In this paper, we aim to learn implicit allocation mechanisms from examples while strictly satisfying fairness constraints, specifically focusing on learning EF1 allocation mechanisms through supervised learning on examples of reported valuations and corresponding allocation outcomes produced by implicit rules. To address this, we developed a neural RR (NRR), a novel neural network that parameterizes RR. NRR is built from a differentiable relaxation of RR and can be trained to learn the agent ordering used for RR. We conducted experiments to learn EF1 allocation mechanisms from examples, demonstrating that our method outperforms baselines in terms of the proximity of predicted allocations and other metrics.

Abstract: Local causal discovery aims to learn and distinguish the direct causes and effects of a target variable from observed data. Existing constraint-based local causal discovery methods use AND or OR rules in constructing the local causal skeleton, but using either rule alone is prone to produce cascading errors in the learned local causal skeleton, and thus impacting the inference of local causal relationships. On the other hand, directly applying score-based global causal discovery methods to local causal discovery may randomly return incorrect results due to the existence of local equivalence classes. To address the above issues, we propose a Hybrid Local Causal Discovery algorithm, called HLCD. Specifically, HLCD initially utilizes a constraint-based approach combined with the OR rule to obtain a candidate skeleton and then employs a score-based method to eliminate redundant portions in the candidate skeleton. Furthermore, during the local causal orientation phase, HLCD distinguishes between V-structures and equivalence classes by comparing the local structure scores between the two, thereby avoiding orientation interference caused by local equivalence classes. We conducted extensive experiments with seven state-of-the-art competitors on 14 benchmark Bayesian network datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that HLCD significantly outperforms existing local causal discovery algorithms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged with many intellectual capacities. While numerous benchmarks assess their intelligence, limited attention has been given to their ability to explore--an essential capacity for discovering new information and adapting to novel environments in both natural and artificial systems. The extent to which LLMs can effectively explore, particularly in open-ended tasks, remains unclear. This study investigates whether LLMs can surpass humans in exploration during an open-ended task, using Little Alchemy 2 as a paradigm, where agents combine elements to discover new ones. Results show most LLMs underperform compared to humans, except for the o1 model, with traditional LLMs relying primarily on uncertainty-driven strategies, unlike humans who balance uncertainty and empowerment. Results indicate that traditional reasoning-focused LLMs, such as GPT-4o, exhibit a significantly faster and less detailed reasoning process, limiting their exploratory performance. In contrast, the DeepSeek reasoning model demonstrates prolonged, iterative thought processes marked by repetitive analysis of combinations and past trials, reflecting a more thorough and human-like exploration strategy. Representational analysis of the models with Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) revealed that uncertainty and choices are represented at earlier transformer blocks, while empowerment values are processed later, causing LLMs to think too fast and make premature decisions, hindering effective exploration. These findings shed light on the limitations of LLM exploration and suggest directions for improving their adaptability.

Abstract: The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the European AI Act in terms of its logical modalities, with the aim of preparing its formal representation, for example, within the logic-pluralistic Knowledge Engineering Framework and Methodology (LogiKEy). LogiKEy develops computational tools for normative reasoning based on formal methods, employing Higher-Order Logic (HOL) as a unifying meta-logic to integrate diverse logics through shallow semantic embeddings. This integration is facilitated by Isabelle/HOL, a proof assistant tool equipped with several automated theorem provers. The modalities within the AI Act and the logics suitable for their representation are discussed. For a selection of these logics, embeddings in HOL are created, which are then used to encode sample paragraphs. Initial experiments evaluate the suitability of these embeddings for automated reasoning, and highlight key challenges on the way to more robust reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Benchmark contamination has become a significant concern in the LLM evaluation community. Previous Agents-as-an-Evaluator address this issue by involving agents in the generation of questions. Despite their success, the biases in Agents-as-an-Evaluator methods remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a theoretical formulation of evaluation bias, providing valuable insights into designing unbiased evaluation protocols. Furthermore, we identify two type of bias in Agents-as-an-Evaluator through carefully designed probing tasks on a minimal Agents-as-an-Evaluator setup. To address these issues, we propose the Unbiased Evaluator, an evaluation protocol that delivers a more comprehensive, unbiased, and interpretable assessment of LLMs.Extensive experiments reveal significant room for improvement in current LLMs. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Unbiased Evaluator not only offers strong evidence of benchmark contamination but also provides interpretable evaluation results.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used in cybersecurity such as autonomous security analysis or penetration testing. Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges serve as benchmarks to assess automated task-planning abilities of LLM agents for cybersecurity. Early attempts to apply LLMs for solving CTF challenges used single-agent systems, where feedback was restricted to a single reasoning-action loop. This approach was inadequate for complex CTF tasks. Inspired by real-world CTF competitions, where teams of experts collaborate, we introduce the D-CIPHER LLM multi-agent framework for collaborative CTF solving. D-CIPHER integrates agents with distinct roles with dynamic feedback loops to enhance reasoning on complex tasks. It introduces the Planner-Executor agent system, consisting of a Planner agent for overall problem-solving along with multiple heterogeneous Executor agents for individual tasks, facilitating efficient allocation of responsibilities among the agents. Additionally, D-CIPHER incorporates an Auto-prompter agent to improve problem-solving by auto-generating a highly relevant initial prompt. We evaluate D-CIPHER on multiple CTF benchmarks and LLM models via comprehensive studies to highlight the impact of our enhancements. Additionally, we manually map the CTFs in NYU CTF Bench to MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques that apply for a comprehensive evaluation of D-CIPHER's offensive security capability. D-CIPHER achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks: 22.0% on NYU CTF Bench, 22.5% on Cybench, and 44.0% on HackTheBox, which is 2.5% to 8.5% better than previous work. D-CIPHER solves 65% more ATT&amp;CK techniques compared to previous work, demonstrating stronger offensive capability.

Abstract: This paper introduces ExKLoP, a novel framework designed to evaluate how effectively Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate expert knowledge into logical reasoning systems. This capability is especially valuable in engineering, where expert knowledge-such as manufacturer-recommended operational ranges-can be directly embedded into automated monitoring systems. By mirroring expert verification steps, tasks like range checking and constraint validation help ensure system safety and reliability. Our approach systematically evaluates LLM-generated logical rules, assessing both syntactic fluency and logical correctness in these critical validation tasks. We also explore the models' capacity for self-correction via an iterative feedback loop based on code execution outcomes. ExKLoP presents an extensible dataset comprising 130 engineering premises, 950 prompts, and corresponding validation points. It enables comprehensive benchmarking while allowing control over task complexity and scalability of experiments. We leverage the synthetic data creation methodology to conduct extensive empirical evaluation on a diverse set of LLMs including Llama3, Gemma3, Codestral and QwenCoder. The results reveal that most models generate nearly perfect syntactically correct code and exhibit strong performance in translating expert knowledge into correct code. At the same time, while most LLMs produce nearly flawless syntactic output, their ability to correctly implement logical rules varies, as does their capacity for self-improvement. Overall, ExKLoP serves as a robust evaluation platform that streamlines the selection of effective models for self-correcting systems while clearly delineating the types of errors encountered.

Abstract: Empirical human-AI alignment aims to make AI systems act in line with observed human behavior. While noble in its goals, we argue that empirical alignment can inadvertently introduce statistical biases that warrant caution. This position paper thus advocates against naive empirical alignment, offering prescriptive alignment and a posteriori empirical alignment as alternatives. We substantiate our principled argument by tangible examples like human-centric decoding of language models.

Abstract: AI presents a novel tool for deciphering the motivations behind human behaviors. By varying prompts to a large language model, we can elicit the full range of human behaviors in a variety of different scenarios in classic economic games. By analyzing which prompts elicit which behaviors, we infer (decipher) the motivations behind the human behaviors. We also show how one can analyze the prompts to reveal relationships between the classic economic games, providing insight into what different economic scenarios induce people to think about. We also show how this deciphering process can be used to understand differences in the behavioral tendencies of different populations. We show how AI offers a new way to examine the thinking and framing that produce different behaviors.

Abstract: World models aim to learn action-controlled future prediction and have proven essential for the development of intelligent agents. However, most existing world models rely heavily on substantial action-labeled data and costly training, making it challenging to adapt to novel environments with heterogeneous actions through limited interactions. This limitation can hinder their applicability across broader domains. To overcome this limitation, we propose AdaWorld, an innovative world model learning approach that enables efficient adaptation. The key idea is to incorporate action information during the pretraining of world models. This is achieved by extracting latent actions from videos in a self-supervised manner, capturing the most critical transitions between frames. We then develop an autoregressive world model that conditions on these latent actions. This learning paradigm enables highly adaptable world models, facilitating efficient transfer and learning of new actions even with limited interactions and finetuning. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple environments demonstrate that AdaWorld achieves superior performance in both simulation quality and visual planning.

Abstract: In order to reduce the cost of experimental evaluation for agents, we introduce a computational theory of evaluation for mini agents: build evaluation model to accelerate the evaluation procedures. We prove upper bounds of generalized error and generalized causal effect error of given evaluation models for infinite agents. We also prove efficiency, and consistency to estimated causal effect from deployed agents to evaluation metric by prediction. To learn evaluation models, we propose a meta-learner to handle heterogeneous agents space problem. Comparing with existed evaluation approaches, our (conditional) evaluation model reduced 24.1\% to 99.0\% evaluation errors across 12 scenes, including individual medicine, scientific simulation, social experiment, business activity, and quantum trade. The evaluation time is reduced 3 to 7 order of magnitude per subject comparing with experiments or simulations.

Abstract: With the advancement of web techniques, they have significantly revolutionized various aspects of people's lives. Despite the importance of the web, many tasks performed on it are repetitive and time-consuming, negatively impacting overall quality of life. To efficiently handle these tedious daily tasks, one of the most promising approaches is to advance autonomous agents based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, referred to as AI Agents, as they can operate continuously without fatigue or performance degradation. In the context of the web, leveraging AI Agents -- termed WebAgents -- to automatically assist people in handling tedious daily tasks can dramatically enhance productivity and efficiency. Recently, Large Foundation Models (LFMs) containing billions of parameters have exhibited human-like language understanding and reasoning capabilities, showing proficiency in performing various complex tasks. This naturally raises the question: `Can LFMs be utilized to develop powerful AI Agents that automatically handle web tasks, providing significant convenience to users?' To fully explore the potential of LFMs, extensive research has emerged on WebAgents designed to complete daily web tasks according to user instructions, significantly enhancing the convenience of daily human life. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies on WebAgents across three key aspects: architectures, training, and trustworthiness. Additionally, several promising directions for future research are explored to provide deeper insights.

Abstract: As digitalization and cloud technologies evolve, the web is becoming increasingly important in the modern society. Autonomous web agents based on large language models (LLMs) hold a great potential in work automation. It is therefore important to accurately measure and monitor the progression of their capabilities. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the current state of web agents. Our results depict a very different picture of the competency of current agents, suggesting over-optimism in previously reported results. This gap can be attributed to shortcomings in existing benchmarks. We introduce Online-Mind2Web, an online evaluation benchmark consisting of 300 diverse and realistic tasks spanning 136 websites. It enables us to evaluate web agents under a setting that approximates how real users use these agents. To facilitate more scalable evaluation and development, we also develop a novel LLM-as-a-Judge automatic evaluation method and show that it can achieve around 85% agreement with human judgment, substantially higher than existing methods. Finally, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of current web agents, highlighting both their strengths and limitations to inspire future research.

Abstract: How do reasoning models verify their own answers? We study this question by training a model using DeepSeek R1's recipe on the CountDown task. We leverage the fact that preference tuning leads to mode collapse, yielding a model that always produces highly structured chain-of-thought sequences. With this setup, we do top-down and bottom-up analyses to reverse-engineer how the model verifies its outputs. Top-down, we find Gated Linear Unit (GLU) weights encoding verification-related tokens, such as ``success'' or ``incorrect''. Bottom-up, we find that ``previous-token heads'' are mainly responsible for self-verification in our setup. Our analyses meet in the middle: drawing inspiration from inter-layer communication channels, we use the identified GLU weights to localize as few as three attention heads that can disable self-verification, pointing to a necessary component of a potentially larger verification circuit. Finally, we verify that similar verification components exist in our base model and a general reasoning DeepSeek-R1 model.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enhances AI system transparency by framing interpretability as an optimization problem. However, this approach often necessitates numerous iterations of computationally intensive operations, limiting its applicability in real-time scenarios. While recent research has focused on XAI hardware acceleration on FPGAs and TPU, these methods do not fully address energy efficiency in real-time settings. To address this limitation, we propose XAIedge, a novel framework that leverages approximate computing techniques into XAI algorithms, including integrated gradients, model distillation, and Shapley analysis. XAIedge translates these algorithms into approximate matrix computations and exploits the synergy between convolution, Fourier transform, and approximate computing paradigms. This approach enables efficient hardware acceleration on TPU-based edge devices, facilitating faster real-time outcome interpretations. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that XAIedge achieves a $2\times$ improvement in energy efficiency compared to existing accurate XAI hardware acceleration techniques while maintaining comparable accuracy. These results highlight the potential of XAIedge to significantly advance the deployment of explainable AI in energy-constrained real-time applications.

Abstract: Measuring progress is fundamental to the advancement of any scientific field. As benchmarks play an increasingly central role, they also grow more susceptible to distortion. Chatbot Arena has emerged as the go-to leaderboard for ranking the most capable AI systems. Yet, in this work we identify systematic issues that have resulted in a distorted playing field. We find that undisclosed private testing practices benefit a handful of providers who are able to test multiple variants before public release and retract scores if desired. We establish that the ability of these providers to choose the best score leads to biased Arena scores due to selective disclosure of performance results. At an extreme, we identify 27 private LLM variants tested by Meta in the lead-up to the Llama-4 release. We also establish that proprietary closed models are sampled at higher rates (number of battles) and have fewer models removed from the arena than open-weight and open-source alternatives. Both these policies lead to large data access asymmetries over time. Providers like Google and OpenAI have received an estimated 19.2% and 20.4% of all data on the arena, respectively. In contrast, a combined 83 open-weight models have only received an estimated 29.7% of the total data. We show that access to Chatbot Arena data yields substantial benefits; even limited additional data can result in relative performance gains of up to 112% on the arena distribution, based on our conservative estimates. Together, these dynamics result in overfitting to Arena-specific dynamics rather than general model quality. The Arena builds on the substantial efforts of both the organizers and an open community that maintains this valuable evaluation platform. We offer actionable recommendations to reform the Chatbot Arena's evaluation framework and promote fairer, more transparent benchmarking for the field

Abstract: Over the past two decades, CNN architectures have produced compelling models of sound perception and cognition, learning hierarchical organizations of features. Analogous to successes in computer vision, audio feature classification can be optimized for a particular task of interest, over a wide variety of datasets and labels. In fact similar architectures designed for image understanding have proven effective for acoustic scene analysis. Here we propose applying Transformer based architectures without convolutional layers to raw audio signals. On a standard dataset of Free Sound 50K,comprising of 200 categories, our model outperforms convolutional models to produce state of the art results. This is significant as unlike in natural language processing and computer vision, we do not perform unsupervised pre-training for outperforming convolutional architectures. On the same training set, with respect mean aver-age precision benchmarks, we show a significant improvement. We further improve the performance of Transformer architectures by using techniques such as pooling inspired from convolutional net-work designed in the past few years. In addition, we also show how multi-rate signal processing ideas inspired from wavelets, can be applied to the Transformer embeddings to improve the results. We also show how our models learns a non-linear non constant band-width filter-bank, which shows an adaptable time frequency front end representation for the task of audio understanding, different from other tasks e.g. pitch estimation.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated impressive results in domains such as games and robotics, where task formulations are well-defined. However, few DRL benchmarks are grounded in complex, real-world environments, where safety constraints, partial observability, and the need for hand-engineered task representations pose significant challenges. To help bridge this gap, we introduce a testbed based on the pump scheduling problem in a real-world water distribution facility. The task involves controlling pumps to ensure a reliable water supply while minimizing energy consumption and respecting the constraints of the system. Our testbed includes a realistic simulator, three years of high-resolution (1-minute) operational data from human-led control, and a baseline RL task formulation. This testbed supports a wide range of research directions, including offline RL, safe exploration, inverse RL, and multi-objective optimization.

Abstract: Building ethical machines may involve bestowing upon them the emotional capacity to self-evaluate and repent on their actions. While apologies represent potential strategic interactions, the explicit evolution of guilt as a behavioural trait remains poorly understood. Our study delves into the co-evolution of two forms of emotional guilt: social guilt entails a cost, requiring agents to exert efforts to understand others' internal states and behaviours; and non-social guilt, which only involves awareness of one's own state, incurs no social cost. Resorting to methods from evolutionary game theory, we study analytically, and through extensive numerical and agent-based simulations, whether and how guilt can evolve and deploy, depending on the underlying structure of the systems of agents. Our findings reveal that in lattice and scale-free networks, strategies favouring emotional guilt dominate a broader range of guilt and social costs compared to non-structured well-mixed populations, so leading to higher levels of cooperation. In structured populations, both social and non-social guilt can thrive through clustering with emotionally inclined strategies, thereby providing protection against exploiters, particularly for less costly non-social strategies. These insights shed light on the complex interplay of guilt and cooperation, enhancing our understanding of ethical artificial intelligence.

Abstract: The vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks has been attracting considerable attention in recent years. Most existing studies focus on the behavior of stand-alone single-agent learners. In comparison, this work studies adversarial training over graphs, where individual agents are subjected to perturbations of varied strength levels across space. It is expected that interactions by linked agents, and the heterogeneity of the attack models that are possible over the graph, can help enhance robustness in view of the coordination power of the group. Using a min-max formulation of distributed learning, we develop a decentralized adversarial training framework for multi-agent systems. Specifically, we devise two decentralized adversarial training algorithms by relying on two popular decentralized learning strategies--diffusion and consensus. We analyze the convergence properties of the proposed framework for strongly-convex, convex, and non-convex environments, and illustrate the enhanced robustness to adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Clickbait, which aims to induce users with some surprising and even thrilling headlines for increasing click-through rates, permeates almost all online content publishers, such as news portals and social media. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful instrument and achieved tremendous success in a series of NLP downstream tasks. However, it is not yet known whether LLMs can be served as a high-quality clickbait detection system. In this paper, we analyze the performance of LLMs in the few-shot and zero-shot scenarios on several English and Chinese benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that LLMs cannot achieve the best results compared to the state-of-the-art deep and fine-tuning PLMs methods. Different from human intuition, the experiments demonstrated that LLMs cannot make satisfied clickbait detection just by the headlines.

Abstract: Reviewing plays an important role when learning knowledge. The knowledge acquisition at a certain time point may be strongly inspired with the help of previous experience. Thus the knowledge growing procedure should show strong relationship along the temporal dimension. In our research, we find that during the network training, the evolution of feature map follows temporal sequence property. A proper temporal supervision may further improve the network training performance. Inspired by this observation, we propose Temporal Supervised Knowledge Distillation (TSKD). Specifically, we extract the spatiotemporal features in the different training phases of student by convolutional Long Short-term memory network (Conv-LSTM). Then, we train the student net through a dynamic target, rather than static teacher network features. This process realizes the refinement of old knowledge in student network, and utilizes it to assist current learning. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and advantages of our method over existing knowledge distillation methods, including various network architectures and different tasks (image classification and object detection) .

Abstract: Human feedback is commonly utilized to finetune AI assistants. But human feedback may also encourage model responses that match user beliefs over truthful ones, a behaviour known as sycophancy. We investigate the prevalence of sycophancy in models whose finetuning procedure made use of human feedback, and the potential role of human preference judgments in such behavior. We first demonstrate that five state-of-the-art AI assistants consistently exhibit sycophancy across four varied free-form text-generation tasks. To understand if human preferences drive this broadly observed behavior, we analyze existing human preference data. We find that when a response matches a user's views, it is more likely to be preferred. Moreover, both humans and preference models (PMs) prefer convincingly-written sycophantic responses over correct ones a non-negligible fraction of the time. Optimizing model outputs against PMs also sometimes sacrifices truthfulness in favor of sycophancy. Overall, our results indicate that sycophancy is a general behavior of state-of-the-art AI assistants, likely driven in part by human preference judgments favoring sycophantic responses.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIA) can reveal whether a particular data point was part of the training dataset, potentially exposing sensitive information about individuals. This article provides theoretical guarantees by exploring the fundamental statistical limitations associated with MIAs on machine learning models at large. More precisely, we first derive the statistical quantity that governs the effectiveness and success of such attacks. We then theoretically prove that in a non-linear regression setting with overfitting learning procedures, attacks may have a high probability of success. Finally, we investigate several situations for which we provide bounds on this quantity of interest. Interestingly, our findings indicate that discretizing the data might enhance the learning procedure's security. Specifically, it is demonstrated to be limited by a constant, which quantifies the diversity of the underlying data distribution. We illustrate those results through simple simulations.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems increasingly underpin critical applications, from autonomous vehicles to biometric authentication, their vulnerability to transferable attacks presents a growing concern. These attacks, designed to generalize across instances, domains, models, tasks, modalities, or even hardware platforms, pose severe risks to security, privacy, and system integrity. This survey delivers the first comprehensive review of transferable attacks across seven major categories, including evasion, backdoor, data poisoning, model stealing, model inversion, membership inference, and side-channel attacks. We introduce a unified six-dimensional taxonomy: cross-instance, cross-domain, cross-modality, cross-model, cross-task, and cross-hardware, which systematically captures the diverse transfer pathways of adversarial strategies. Through this framework, we examine both the underlying mechanics and practical implications of transferable attacks on AI systems. Furthermore, we review cutting-edge methods for enhancing attack transferability, organized around data augmentation and optimization strategies. By consolidating fragmented research and identifying critical future directions, this work provides a foundational roadmap for understanding, evaluating, and defending against transferable threats in real-world AI systems.

Abstract: Recovering textures under shadows has remained a challenging problem due to the difficulty of inferring shadow-free scenes from shadow images. In this paper, we propose the use of diffusion models as they offer a promising approach to gradually refine the details of shadow regions during the diffusion process. Our method improves this process by conditioning on a learned latent feature space that inherits the characteristics of shadow-free images, thus avoiding the limitation of conventional methods that condition on degraded images only. Additionally, we propose to alleviate potential local optima during training by fusing noise features with the diffusion network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach which outperforms the previous best method by 13% in terms of RMSE on the AISTD dataset. Further, we explore instance-level shadow removal, where our model outperforms the previous best method by 82% in terms of RMSE on the DESOBA dataset.

Abstract: This report introduces a new family of multimodal models, Gemini, that exhibit remarkable capabilities across image, audio, video, and text understanding. The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 of these benchmarks - notably being the first model to achieve human-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of the art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe that the new capabilities of the Gemini family in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases. We discuss our approach toward post-training and deploying Gemini models responsibly to users through services including Gemini, Gemini Advanced, Google AI Studio, and Cloud Vertex AI.

Abstract: In practical statistical causal discovery (SCD), embedding domain expert knowledge as constraints into the algorithm is important for reasonable causal models reflecting the broad knowledge of domain experts, despite the challenges in the systematic acquisition of background knowledge. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel method for causal inference, in which SCD and knowledge-based causal inference (KBCI) with a large language model (LLM) are synthesized through ``statistical causal prompting (SCP)'' for LLMs and prior knowledge augmentation for SCD. The experiments in this work have revealed that the results of LLM-KBCI and SCD augmented with LLM-KBCI approach the ground truths, more than the SCD result without prior knowledge. These experiments have also revealed that the SCD result can be further improved if the LLM undergoes SCP. Furthermore, with an unpublished real-world dataset, we have demonstrated that the background knowledge provided by the LLM can improve the SCD on this dataset, even if this dataset has never been included in the training data of the LLM. For future practical application of this proposed method across important domains such as healthcare, we also thoroughly discuss the limitations, risks of critical errors, expected improvement of techniques around LLMs, and realistic integration of expert checks of the results into this automatic process, with SCP simulations under various conditions both in successful and failure scenarios. The careful and appropriate application of the proposed approach in this work, with improvement and customization for each domain, can thus address challenges such as dataset biases and limitations, illustrating the potential of LLMs to improve data-driven causal inference across diverse scientific domains.

Abstract: This paper conducts a user study to assess whether three machine learning (ML) interpretability layouts can influence participants' views when evaluating sentences containing hate speech, focusing on the "Misogyny" and "Racism" classes. Given the existence of divergent conclusions in the literature, we provide empirical evidence on using ML interpretability in online communities through statistical and qualitative analyses of questionnaire responses. The Generalized Additive Model estimates participants' ratings, incorporating within-subject and between-subject designs. While our statistical analysis indicates that none of the interpretability layouts significantly influences participants' views, our qualitative analysis demonstrates the advantages of ML interpretability: 1) triggering participants to provide corrective feedback in case of discrepancies between their views and the model, and 2) providing insights to evaluate a model's behavior beyond traditional performance metrics.

Abstract: LLM-based intelligent agents face significant deployment challenges, particularly related to resource management. Allowing unrestricted access to LLM or tool resources can lead to inefficient or even potentially harmful resource allocation and utilization for agents. Furthermore, the absence of proper scheduling and resource management mechanisms in current agent designs hinders concurrent processing and limits overall system efficiency. As the diversity and complexity of agents continue to grow, addressing these resource management issues becomes increasingly critical to LLM-based agent systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the architecture of AIOS (LLM-based AI Agent Operating System) under the context of managing LLM-based agents. It introduces a novel architecture for serving LLM-based agents by isolating resources and LLM-specific services from agent applications into an AIOS kernel. This AIOS kernel provides fundamental services (e.g., scheduling, context management, memory management, storage management, access control) and efficient management of resources (e.g., LLM and external tools) for runtime agents. To enhance usability, AIOS also includes an AIOS-Agent SDK, a comprehensive suite of APIs designed for utilizing functionalities provided by the AIOS kernel. Experimental results demonstrate that using AIOS can achieve up to 2.1x faster execution for serving agents built by various agent frameworks.

<title>On the Impact of Black-box Deployment Strategies for Edge AI on Latency and Model Performance</title>

Abstract: Deciding what combination of operators to use across the Edge AI tiers to achieve specific latency and model performance requirements is an open question for MLOps engineers. This study aims to empirically assess the accuracy vs inference time trade-off of different black-box Edge AI deployment strategies, i.e., combinations of deployment operators and deployment tiers. In this paper, we conduct inference experiments involving 3 deployment operators (i.e., Partitioning, Quantization, Early Exit), 3 deployment tiers (i.e., Mobile, Edge, Cloud) and their combinations on four widely used Computer-Vision models to investigate the optimal strategies from the point of view of MLOps developers. Our findings suggest that Edge deployment using the hybrid Quantization + Early Exit operator could be preferred over non-hybrid operators (Quantization/Early Exit on Edge, Partition on Mobile-Edge) when faster latency is a concern at medium accuracy loss. However, when minimizing accuracy loss is a concern, MLOps engineers should prefer using only a Quantization operator on edge at a latency reduction or increase, respectively over the Early Exit/Partition (on edge/mobile-edge) and Quantized Early Exit (on edge) operators. In scenarios constrained by Mobile CPU/RAM resources, a preference for Partitioning across mobile and edge tiers is observed over mobile deployment. For models with smaller input data samples (such as FCN), a network-constrained cloud deployment can also be a better alternative than Mobile/Edge deployment and Partitioning strategies. For models with large input data samples (ResNet, ResNext, DUC), an edge tier having higher network/computational capabilities than Cloud/Mobile can be a more viable option than Partitioning and Mobile/Cloud deployment strategies.

Abstract: Edge detection is a long-standing problem in computer vision. Despite the efficiency of existing algorithms, their performance, however, rely heavily on the pre-trained weights of the backbone network on the ImageNet dataset. The use of pre-trained weights in previous methods significantly increases the difficulty to design new models for edge detection without relying on existing well-trained ImageNet models, as pre-training the model on the ImageNet dataset is expensive and becomes compulsory to ensure the fairness of comparison. Besides, the pre-training and fine-tuning strategy is not always useful and sometimes even inaccessible. For instance, the pre-trained weights on the ImageNet dataset are unlikely to be helpful for edge detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images due to strong differences in the statistics between optical images and SAR images. Moreover, no dataset has comparable size to the ImageNet dataset for SAR image processing. In this work, we study the performance achievable by state-of-the-art deep learning based edge detectors in publicly available datasets when they are trained from scratch, and devise a new network architecture, the multi-stream and multi-scale fusion net (msmsfnet), for edge detection. We show in our experiments that by training all models from scratch, our model outperforms state-of-the-art edge detectors in three publicly available datasets. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our model for edge detection in SAR images, where no useful pre-trained weight is available. Finally, We show that our model is able to achieve competitive performance on the BSDS500 dataset when the pre-trained weights are used.

Abstract: While numerous frameworks have been developed to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there is a scarcity of methods that effectively balance the trade-off between cost and quality. In this paper, we introduce Fleet of Agents (FoA), a novel and intuitive yet principled framework utilizing LLMs as agents to navigate through dynamic tree searches, employing a genetic-type particle filtering approach. FoA spawns a multitude of agents, each exploring the search space autonomously, followed by a selection phase where resampling based on a heuristic value function optimizes the balance between exploration and exploitation. This mechanism enables dynamic branching, adapting the exploration strategy based on discovered solutions. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark tasks, ``Game of 24'', ``Mini-Crosswords'', and ``WebShop'', utilizing four different LLMs, ``GPT-3.5'', ``GPT-4'', ``LLaMA3.2-11B'', and ``LLaMA3.2-90B''. On average across all tasks and LLMs, FoA obtains a quality improvement of ~5% while requiring only ~40% of the cost of previous SOTA methods. Notably, our analyses reveal that (1) FoA achieves the best cost-quality trade-off among all benchmarked methods and (2) FoA + LLaMA3.2-11B surpasses the Llama3.2-90B model. FoA is publicly available at https://github.com/au-clan/FoA.

Abstract: This paper shows that dimensionality reduction methods such as UMAP and t-SNE, can be approximately recast as MAP inference methods corresponding to a model introduced in Ravuri et al. (2023), that describes the graph Laplacian (an estimate of the data precision matrix) using a Wishart distribution, with a mean given by a non-linear covariance function evaluated on the latents. This interpretation offers deeper theoretical and semantic insights into such algorithms, and forging a connection to Gaussian process latent variable models by showing that well-known kernels can be used to describe covariances implied by graph Laplacians. We also introduce tools with which similar dimensionality reduction methods can be studied.

<title>MedualTime: A Dual-Adapter Language Model for Medical Time Series-Text Multimodal Learning</title>

Abstract: The recent rapid advancements in language models (LMs) have garnered attention in medical time series-text multimodal learning. However, existing contrastive learning-based and prompt-based LM approaches tend to be biased, often assigning a primary role to time series modality while treating text modality as secondary. We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings. Furthermore, MedualTime's transferability is validated by few-shot label transfer experiments from coarse-grained to fine-grained medical data. https://github.com/start2020/MedualTime

<title>CodeV: Empowering LLMs with HDL Generation through Multi-Level Summarization</title>

Abstract: The design flow of processors, particularly in hardware description languages (HDL) like Verilog and Chisel, is complex and costly. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved coding tasks in software languages such as Python, their application in HDL generation remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality HDL data. Traditional methods of adapting LLMs for hardware design rely on synthetic HDL datasets, which often suffer from low quality because even advanced LLMs like GPT perform poorly in the HDL domain. Moreover, these methods focus solely on chat tasks and the Verilog language, limiting their application scenarios.
  In this paper, we observe that: (1) HDL code collected from the real world is of higher quality than code generated by LLMs. (2) LLMs like GPT-3.5 excel in summarizing HDL code rather than generating it. (3) An explicit language tag can help LLMs better adapt to the target language when there is insufficient data. Based on these observations, we propose an efficient LLM fine-tuning pipeline for HDL generation that integrates a multi-level summarization data synthesis process with a novel Chat-FIM-Tag supervised fine-tuning method. The pipeline enhances the generation of HDL code from natural language descriptions and enables the handling of various tasks such as chat and infilling incomplete code. Utilizing this pipeline, we introduce CodeV, a series of HDL generation LLMs. Among them, CodeV-All not only possesses a more diverse range of language abilities, i.e. Verilog and Chisel, and a broader scope of tasks, i.e. Chat and fill-in-middle (FIM), but it also achieves performance on VerilogEval that is comparable to or even surpasses that of CodeV-Verilog fine-tuned on Verilog only, making them the first series of open-source LLMs designed for multi-scenario HDL generation.

<title>ROLeR: Effective Reward Shaping in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective tool for real-world recommender systems with its capacity to model the dynamic interest of users and its interactive nature. Most existing offline RL recommender systems focus on model-based RL through learning a world model from offline data and building the recommendation policy by interacting with this model. Although these methods have made progress in the recommendation performance, the effectiveness of model-based offline RL methods is often constrained by the accuracy of the estimation of the reward model and the model uncertainties, primarily due to the extreme discrepancy between offline logged data and real-world data in user interactions with online platforms. To fill this gap, a more accurate reward model and uncertainty estimation are needed for the model-based RL methods. In this paper, a novel model-based Reward Shaping in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems, ROLeR, is proposed for reward and uncertainty estimation in recommendation systems. Specifically, a non-parametric reward shaping method is designed to refine the reward model. In addition, a flexible and more representative uncertainty penalty is designed to fit the needs of recommendation systems. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets showcase that ROLeR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing baselines.

<title>The Energy Cost of Artificial Intelligence Lifecycle in Communication Networks</title>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being incorporated in several optimization, scheduling, orchestration as well as in native communication network functions. While this paradigm shift results in increased energy consumption, quantifying the end-toend energy consumption of adding intelligence to such systems is particularly challenging. Conventional metrics focus on either communication, computation infrastructure, or model development. To address this, we propose a new metric, the Energy Cost of AI Lifecycle (eCAL) of one AI model in a system. eCAL captures the energy consumption throughout the development and deployment of an AI-model providing intelligence in a wireless communication network by analyzing the complexity of data collection and manipulation in individual components and deriving overall and per-bit energy consumption. We show that the better a model is and the more it is used, the more energy efficient an inference is. For a simple case study, eCAL for making 100 inferences is 2.73 times higher than for 1000 inferences. Additionally, we have developed a modular and extendable opensource simulation tool to enable researchers, practitioners, and engineers to calculate the end-to-end energy cost with various configurations and across various systems, ensuring adaptability to diverse use cases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have generated significant attention since their inception, finding applications across various academic and industrial domains. However, these models often suffer from the "hallucination problem", where outputs, though grammatically and logically coherent, lack factual accuracy or are entirely fabricated. A particularly troubling issue discovered and widely discussed recently is the numerical comparison error where multiple LLMs incorrectly infer that "9.11$>$9.9". We discovered that the order in which LLMs generate answers and reasoning impacts their consistency. Specifically, results vary significantly when an LLM generates an answer first and then provides the reasoning versus generating the reasoning process first and then the conclusion. Inspired by this, we propose a new benchmark method for assessing LLM consistency: comparing responses generated through these two different approaches. This benchmark effectively identifies instances where LLMs fabricate answers and subsequently generate justifications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel and straightforward prompt strategy designed to mitigate this issue. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across various LLMs compared to direct questioning. This work not only sheds light on a critical flaw in LLMs but also offers a practical solution to enhance their reliability.

<title>Poly2Vec: Polymorphic Fourier-Based Encoding of Geospatial Objects for GeoAI Applications</title>

Abstract: Encoding geospatial objects is fundamental for geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) applications, which leverage machine learning (ML) models to analyze spatial information. Common approaches transform each object into known formats, like image and text, for compatibility with ML models. However, this process often discards crucial spatial information, such as the object's position relative to the entire space, reducing downstream task effectiveness. Alternative encoding methods that preserve some spatial properties are often devised for specific data objects (e.g., point encoders), making them unsuitable for tasks that involve different data types (i.e., points, polylines, and polygons). To this end, we propose Poly2Vec, a polymorphic Fourier-based encoding approach that unifies the representation of geospatial objects, while preserving the essential spatial properties. Poly2Vec incorporates a learned fusion module that adaptively integrates the magnitude and phase of the Fourier transform for different tasks and geometries. We evaluate Poly2Vec on five diverse tasks, organized into two categories. The first empirically demonstrates that Poly2Vec consistently outperforms object-specific baselines in preserving three key spatial relationships: topology, direction, and distance. The second shows that integrating Poly2Vec into a state-of-the-art GeoAI workflow improves the performance in two popular tasks: population prediction and land use inference.

Abstract: Software testing is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC), ensuring that products meet necessary functional, performance, and quality benchmarks before release. Despite advancements in automation, traditional methods of generating and validating test cases still face significant challenges, including prolonged timelines, human error, incomplete test coverage, and high costs of manual intervention. These limitations often lead to delayed product launches and undetected defects that compromise software quality and user satisfaction. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into software testing presents a promising solution to these persistent challenges. AI-driven testing methods automate the creation of comprehensive test cases, dynamically adapt to changes, and leverage machine learning to identify high-risk areas in the codebase. This approach enhances regression testing efficiency while expanding overall test coverage. Furthermore, AI-powered tools enable continuous testing and self-healing test cases, significantly reducing manual oversight and accelerating feedback loops, ultimately leading to faster and more reliable software releases. This paper explores the transformative potential of AI in improving test case generation and validation, focusing on its ability to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and scalability in testing processes. It also addresses key challenges associated with adapting AI for testing, including the need for high quality training data, ensuring model transparency, and maintaining a balance between automation and human oversight. Through case studies and examples of real-world applications, this paper illustrates how AI can significantly enhance testing efficiency across both legacy and modern software systems.

Abstract: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) extends classical algorithms to higher dimensional data. However, canonical implementations of NAR train neural networks to return only a single solution, even when there are multiple correct solutions to a problem, such as single-source shortest paths. For some applications, it is desirable to recover more than one correct solution. To that end, we give the first method for NAR with multiple solutions. We demonstrate our method on two classical algorithms: Bellman-Ford (BF) and Depth-First Search (DFS), favouring deeper insight into two algorithms over a broader survey of algorithms. This method involves generating appropriate training data as well as sampling and validating solutions from model output. Each step of our method, which can serve as a framework for neural algorithmic reasoning beyond the tasks presented in this paper, might be of independent interest to the field and our results represent the first attempt at this task in the NAR literature.

Abstract: Developing an efficient sampler capable of generating independent and identically distributed (IID) samples from a Boltzmann distribution is a crucial challenge in scientific research, e.g. molecular dynamics. In this work, we intend to learn neural samplers given energy functions instead of data sampled from the Boltzmann distribution. By learning the energies of the noised data, we propose a diffusion-based sampler, Noised Energy Matching, which theoretically has lower variance and more complexity compared to related works. Furthermore, a novel bootstrapping technique is applied to NEM to balance between bias and variance. We evaluate NEM and BNEM on a 2-dimensional 40 Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a 4-particle double-well potential (DW-4). The experimental results demonstrate that BNEM can achieve state-of-the-art performance while being more robust.

<title>Mapping Biomedical Ontology Terms to IDs: Effect of Domain Prevalence on Prediction Accuracy</title>

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to map biomedical ontology terms to their corresponding ontology IDs across the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), Gene Ontology (GO), and UniProtKB terminologies. Using counts of ontology IDs in the PubMed Central (PMC) dataset as a surrogate for their prevalence in the biomedical literature, we examined the relationship between ontology ID prevalence and mapping accuracy. Results indicate that ontology ID prevalence strongly predicts accurate mapping of HPO terms to HPO IDs, GO terms to GO IDs, and protein names to UniProtKB accession numbers. Higher prevalence of ontology IDs in the biomedical literature correlated with higher mapping accuracy. Predictive models based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed this relationship.
  In contrast, this pattern did not apply to mapping protein names to Human Genome Organisation's (HUGO) gene symbols. GPT-4 achieved a high baseline performance (95%) in mapping protein names to HUGO gene symbols, with mapping accuracy unaffected by prevalence. We propose that the high prevalence of HUGO gene symbols in the literature has caused these symbols to become lexicalized, enabling GPT-4 to map protein names to HUGO gene symbols with high accuracy. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs in mapping ontology terms to low-prevalence ontology IDs and underscore the importance of incorporating ontology ID prevalence into the training and evaluation of LLMs for biomedical applications.

Abstract: This study investigates the application and performance of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) in the challenging task of video camouflaged object segmentation (VCOS). VCOS involves detecting objects that blend seamlessly in the surroundings for videos, due to similar colors and textures, poor light conditions, etc. Compared to the objects in normal scenes, camouflaged objects are much more difficult to detect. SAM2, a video foundation model, has shown potential in various tasks. But its effectiveness in dynamic camouflaged scenarios remains under-explored. This study presents a comprehensive study on SAM2's ability in VCOS. First, we assess SAM2's performance on camouflaged video datasets using different models and prompts (click, box, and mask). Second, we explore the integration of SAM2 with existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and VCOS methods. Third, we specifically adapt SAM2 by fine-tuning it on the video camouflaged dataset. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SAM2 has excellent zero-shot ability of detecting camouflaged objects in videos. We also show that this ability could be further improved by specifically adjusting SAM2's parameters for VCOS. The code is available at https://github.com/zhoustan/SAM2-VCOS

Abstract: We explore the capability of transformers to address endogeneity in in-context linear regression. Our main finding is that transformers inherently possess a mechanism to handle endogeneity effectively using instrumental variables (IV). First, we demonstrate that the transformer architecture can emulate a gradient-based bi-level optimization procedure that converges to the widely used two-stage least squares $(\textsf{2SLS})$ solution at an exponential rate. Next, we propose an in-context pretraining scheme and provide theoretical guarantees showing that the global minimizer of the pre-training loss achieves a small excess loss. Our extensive experiments validate these theoretical findings, showing that the trained transformer provides more robust and reliable in-context predictions and coefficient estimates than the $\textsf{2SLS}$ method, in the presence of endogeneity.

Abstract: Decision-making agents based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across various domains of human activity. While their applications are currently rather specialized, several research efforts are underway to develop more generalist agents. As LLM-based systems become more agentic, their influence on human activity will grow and their transparency will decrease. Consequently, developing effective methods for aligning them to human values is vital.
  The prevailing practice in alignment often relies on human preference data (e.g., in RLHF or DPO), in which values are implicit, opaque and are essentially deduced from relative preferences over different model outputs. In this work, instead of relying on human feedback, we introduce the design of reward functions that explicitly and transparently encode core human values for Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning of foundation agent models. Specifically, we use intrinsic rewards for the moral alignment of LLM agents.
  We evaluate our approach using the traditional philosophical frameworks of Deontological Ethics and Utilitarianism, quantifying moral rewards for agents in terms of actions and consequences on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) environment. We also show how moral fine-tuning can be deployed to enable an agent to unlearn a previously developed selfish strategy. Finally, we find that certain moral strategies learned on the IPD game generalize to several other matrix game environments. In summary, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with intrinsic rewards is a promising general solution for aligning LLM agents to human values, and it might represent a more transparent and cost-effective alternative to currently predominant alignment techniques.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative modeling, particularly diffusion models, have opened new directions for time series modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance in forecasting and synthesis. However, the reliance of diffusion-based models on a simple, fixed prior complicates the generative process since the data and prior distributions differ significantly. We introduce TSFlow, a conditional flow matching (CFM) model for time series combining Gaussian processes, optimal transport paths, and data-dependent prior distributions. By incorporating (conditional) Gaussian processes, TSFlow aligns the prior distribution more closely with the temporal structure of the data, enhancing both unconditional and conditional generation. Furthermore, we propose conditional prior sampling to enable probabilistic forecasting with an unconditionally trained model. In our experimental evaluation on eight real-world datasets, we demonstrate the generative capabilities of TSFlow, producing high-quality unconditional samples. Finally, we show that both conditionally and unconditionally trained models achieve competitive results across multiple forecasting benchmarks.

Abstract: Extreme cornering in racing often leads to large sideslip angles, presenting a significant challenge for vehicle control. Conventional vehicle controllers struggle to manage this scenario, necessitating the use of a drifting controller. However, the large sideslip angle in drift conditions introduces model mismatch, which in turn affects control precision. To address this issue, we propose a model correction drift controller that integrates Model Predictive Control (MPC) with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). GPR is employed to correct vehicle model mismatches during both drift equilibrium solving and the MPC optimization process. Additionally, the variance from GPR is utilized to actively explore different cornering drifting velocities, aiming to minimize trajectory tracking errors. The proposed algorithm is validated through simulations on the Simulink-Carsim platform and experiments with a 1:10 scale RC vehicle. In the simulation, the average lateral error with GPR is reduced by 52.8% compared to the non-GPR case. Incorporating exploration further decreases this error by 27.1%. The velocity tracking Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) also decreases by 10.6% with exploration. In the RC car experiment, the average lateral error with GPR is 36.7% lower, and exploration further leads to a 29.0% reduction. Moreover, the velocity tracking RMSE decreases by 7.2% with the inclusion of exploration.

Abstract: Under extreme operating conditions, characterized by high particle multiplicity and heavily overlapping shower energy deposits, classical particle flow algorithms encounter pronounced limitations in resolution, efficiency, and accuracy. To address this challenge, this paper proposes and systematically evaluates a deep learning reconstruction framework: For multichannel sparse features, we design a hybrid loss function combining weighted mean squared error with structural similarity index, effectively balancing pixel-level accuracy and structural fidelity. By integrating 3D convolutions, Squeeze-and-Excitation channel attention, and Offset self-attention modules into baseline convolutional neural networks, we enhance the model's capability to capture cross-modal spatiotemporal correlations and energy-displacement nonlinearities. Validated on custom-constructed simulation data and Pythia jet datasets, the framework's 90K-parameter lightweight variant approaches the performance of 5M-parameter baselines, while the 25M-parameter 3D model achieves state-of-the-art results in both interpolation and extrapolation tasks. Comprehensive experiments quantitatively evaluate component contributions and provide performance-parameter trade-off guidelines. All core code and data processing scripts are open-sourced on a GitHub repository to facilitate community reproducibility and extension.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) has attracted growing interest at the intersection of medical image understanding and natural language processing for clinical applications. By interpreting medical images and providing precise answers to relevant clinical inquiries, MedVQA has the potential to support diagnostic decision-making and reduce workload across various fields like radiology. While recent approaches rely heavily on unified large pre-trained Visual-Language Models, research on more efficient fusion mechanisms remains relatively limited in this domain. In this paper, we introduce a fusion model, OMniBAN, that integrates Orthogonality loss, Multi-head attention, and a Bilinear Attention Network to achieve high computational efficiency as well as solid performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments and demonstrate how bilinear attention fusion can approximate the performance of larger fusion models like cross-modal Transformer. Our results show that OMniBAN requires fewer parameters (approximately 2/3 of Transformer-based Co-Attention) and substantially lower FLOPs (approximately 1/4), while achieving comparable overall performance and even slight improvements on closed-ended questions on two key MedVQA benchmarks. This balance between efficiency and accuracy suggests that OMniBAN could be a viable option for real-world medical image question answering, where computational resources are often constrained.

Abstract: Story-writing is a fundamental aspect of human imagination, relying heavily on creativity to produce narratives that are novel, effective, and surprising. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate high-quality stories, their creative story-writing capabilities remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of creativity in short story generation across 60 LLMs and 60 people using a five-sentence cue-word-based creative story-writing task. We use measures to automatically evaluate model- and human-generated stories across several dimensions of creativity, including novelty, surprise, diversity, and linguistic complexity. We also collect creativity ratings and Turing Test classifications from non-expert and expert human raters and LLMs. Automated metrics show that LLMs generate stylistically complex stories, but tend to fall short in terms of novelty, surprise and diversity when compared to average human writers. Expert ratings generally coincide with automated metrics. However, LLMs and non-experts rate LLM stories to be more creative than human-generated stories. We discuss why and how these differences in ratings occur, and their implications for both human and artificial creativity.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of resource-intensive transformers on edge devices necessitates cross-stack optimization. We thus study the interrelation between structured pruning and systolic acceleration, matching the size of pruned blocks with the systolic array dimensions. In this setting, computations of pruned weight blocks can be skipped, reducing run-time and energy consumption, but potentially impacting quality of service (QoS). To evaluate the trade-offs between systolic array size and sparsity opportunities, we present a novel co-design framework that integrates algorithmic optimization, system simulation, and hardware design. Targeting speech recognition and machine translation using transformers as case study, we analyze how configuration choices across the stack affect performance metrics. Results demonstrate that structured pruning on systems featuring systolic array acceleration can effectively increase performance, while maintaining high QoS levels. Up to 44% system-wide speedups due to structured pruning and quantization were measured, with only 1.4% word error rate degradation on the standard LibriSpeech dataset.

Abstract: Structure-Based molecule optimization (SBMO) aims to optimize molecules with both continuous coordinates and discrete types against protein targets. A promising direction is to exert gradient guidance on generative models given its remarkable success in images, but it is challenging to guide discrete data and risks inconsistencies between modalities. To this end, we leverage a continuous and differentiable space derived through Bayesian inference, presenting Molecule Joint Optimization (MolJO), the gradient-based SBMO framework that facilitates joint guidance signals across different modalities while preserving SE(3)-equivariance. We introduce a novel backward correction strategy that optimizes within a sliding window of the past histories, allowing for a seamless trade-off between explore-and-exploit during optimization. MolJO achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossDocked2020 benchmark (Success Rate 51.3%, Vina Dock -9.05 and SA 0.78), more than 4x improvement in Success Rate compared to the gradient-based counterpart, and 2x "Me-Better" Ratio as much as 3D baselines. Furthermore, we extend MolJO to a wide range of optimization settings, including multi-objective optimization and challenging tasks in drug design such as R-group optimization and scaffold hopping, further underscoring its versatility.

Abstract: The applications of LLM Agents are becoming increasingly complex and diverse, leading to a high demand for structured outputs that can be parsed into code, structured function calls, and embodied agent commands. These developments bring significant demands for structured generation in LLM inference. Context-free grammar is a flexible approach to enable structured generation via constrained decoding. However, executing context-free grammar requires going through several stack states over all tokens in vocabulary during runtime, bringing non-negligible overhead for structured generation. In this paper, we propose XGrammar, a flexible and efficient structure generation engine for large language models. XGrammar accelerates context-free grammar execution by dividing the vocabulary into context-independent tokens that can be prechecked and context-dependent tokens that need to be interpreted during runtime. We further build transformations to expand the grammar context and reduce the number of context-independent tokens. Additionally, we build an efficient persistent stack to accelerate the context-dependent token checks. Finally, we co-design the grammar engine with LLM inference engine to overlap grammar computation with GPU executions. Evaluation results show that XGrammar can achieve up to 100x speedup over existing solutions. Combined with an LLM inference engine, it can generate near-zero overhead structure generation in end-to-end low-LLM serving.

<title>Beyond Text-Visual Attention: Exploiting Visual Cues for Effective Token Pruning in VLMs</title>

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) generally contain significantly more visual tokens than their textual counterparts, resulting in a considerable computational burden. Recent efforts have been made to tackle this issue by pruning visual tokens early within the language model. Most existing works use attention scores between text and visual tokens to assess the importance of visual tokens. However, in this study, we first analyze the text-visual attention in the language model and find that this score is not an ideal indicator for token pruning. Based on the analysis, We propose VisPruner, a plug-and-play method that utilizes visual cues for more effective token pruning in LVLMs. Specifically, we first use visual attention to select a limited number of significant tokens. Then, we remove duplicate tokens from the remaining ones based on their similarity. By retaining diverse tokens alongside the initially selected important tokens, we maximally preserve the visual information of the input image. Experimental results demonstrate that our VisPruner sustains strong performance across various VLM architectures and reduction ratios, significantly outperforming existing methods based on text-visual attention. Notably, without any training, VisPruner can reduce the FLOPs of LLaVA-1.5-7B by 91% and inference latency by 75%, while maintaining comparable performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Theia-4869/VisPruner.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) are usually fine-tuned to participate in dyadic or two-party dialogues, which can not adapt well to multi-party dialogues (MPD), which hinders their applications in such scenarios including multi-personal meetings, discussions and daily communication. Previous LLM-based researches mainly focus on the multi-agent framework, while their base LLMs are still pairwisely fine-tuned. In this work, we design a multi-party fine-tuning framework (MuPaS) for LLMs on the multi-party dialogue datasets, and prove such a straightforward framework can let the LLM align with the multi-party conversation style efficiently and effectively. We also design two training strategies which can convert MuPaS into the MPD simulator. Substantial experiments show that MuPaS can achieve state-of-the-art multi-party response, higher accuracy of the-next-speaker prediction, higher human and automatic evaluated utterance qualities, and can even generate reasonably with out-of-distribution scene, topic and role descriptions. The MuPaS framework bridges the LLM training with more complicated multi-party applications, such as conversation generation, virtual rehearsal or meta-universe.

Abstract: Both encoder-only models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) and large language models (LLMs, e.g., Llama3) have been widely used for text classification tasks. However, there is a lack of systematic studies comparing the performance of encoder-based models and LLMs in text classification, particularly when fine-tuning is involved. This study employed a diverse range of models and methods, varying in size and architecture, and including both fine-tuned and pre-trained approaches. We first assessed the performances of these LLMs on the 20 Newsgroups (20NG) and MASSIVE datasets, comparing them to encoder-only RoBERTa models. Additionally, we explored the multi-task capabilities of both model types by combining multiple classification tasks, including intent detection and slot-filling, into a single model using data from both datasets. Our results indicate that fully fine-tuned Llama3-70B models outperform RoBERTa-large and other decoder LLMs across various classification tasks and datasets. Moreover, the consolidated multi-task fine-tuned LLMs matched the performance of dual-model setups in both tasks across both datasets. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive benchmark of encoder-only and LLM models on text classification tasks and demonstrates a method to combine two or more fully fine-tuned decoder LLMs for reduced latency and equivalent performance.

Abstract: Pathological diagnosis is vital for determining disease characteristics, guiding treatment, and assessing prognosis, relying heavily on detailed, multi-scale analysis of high-resolution whole slide images (WSI). However, traditional pure vision models face challenges of redundant feature extraction, whereas existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are limited by input resolution constraints, hindering their efficiency and accuracy. To overcome these issues, we propose two innovative strategies: the mixed task-guided feature enhancement, which directs feature extraction toward lesion-related details across scales, and the prompt-guided detail feature completion, which integrates coarse- and fine-grained features from WSI based on specific prompts without compromising inference speed. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 490,000 samples from diverse pathology tasks-including cancer detection, grading, vascular and neural invasion identification, and so on-we trained the pathology-specialized LVLM, OmniPath. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, offering an interactive, clinically aligned approach for auxiliary diagnosis in a wide range of pathology applications.

Abstract: Dynamic graph embedding has emerged as an important technique for modeling complex time-evolving networks across diverse domains. While transformer-based models have shown promise in capturing long-range dependencies in temporal graph data, they face scalability challenges due to quadratic computational complexity. This study presents a comparative analysis of dynamic graph embedding approaches using transformers and the recently proposed Mamba architecture, a state-space model with linear complexity. We introduce three novel models: TransformerG2G augment with graph convolutional networks, \mathcal{DG}-Mamba, and \mathcal{GDG}-Mamba with graph isomorphism network edge convolutions. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Mamba-based models achieve comparable or superior performance to transformer-based approaches in link prediction tasks while offering significant computational efficiency gains on longer sequences. Notably, \mathcal{DG}-Mamba variants consistently outperform transformer-based models on datasets with high temporal variability, such as UCI, Bitcoin, and Reality Mining, while maintaining competitive performance on more stable graphs like SBM. We provide insights into the learned temporal dependencies through analysis of attention weights and state matrices, revealing the models' ability to capture complex temporal patterns. By effectively combining state-space models with graph neural networks, our work addresses key limitations of previous approaches and contributes to the growing body of research on efficient temporal graph representation learning. These findings offer promising directions for scaling dynamic graph embedding to larger, more complex real-world networks, potentially enabling new applications in areas such as social network analysis, financial modeling, and biological system dynamics.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in civic, educational, and political information environments, concerns about their potential political bias have grown. Prior research often evaluates such bias through simulated personas or predefined ideological typologies, which may introduce artificial framing effects or overlook how models behave in general use scenarios. This study adopts a persona-free, topic-specific approach to evaluate political behavior in LLMs, reflecting how users typically interact with these systems-without ideological role-play or conditioning. We introduce a two-dimensional framework: one axis captures partisan orientation on highly polarized topics (e.g., abortion, immigration), and the other assesses sociopolitical engagement on less polarized issues (e.g., climate change, foreign policy). Using survey-style prompts drawn from the ANES and Pew Research Center, we analyze responses from 43 LLMs developed in the U.S., Europe, China, and the Middle East. We propose an entropy-weighted bias score to quantify both the direction and consistency of partisan alignment, and identify four behavioral clusters through engagement profiles. Findings show most models lean center-left or left ideologically and vary in their nonpartisan engagement patterns. Model scale and openness are not strong predictors of behavior, suggesting that alignment strategy and institutional context play a more decisive role in shaping political expression.

Abstract: We investigate the multilingual and multimodal performance of a large language model-based artificial intelligence (AI) system, GPT-4o, using a diverse set of physics concept inventories spanning multiple languages and subject categories. The inventories, sourced from the PhysPort website, cover classical physics topics such as mechanics, electromagnetism, optics, and thermodynamics, as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, astronomy, mathematics, and laboratory skills. Unlike previous text-only studies, we uploaded the inventories as images to reflect what a student would see on paper, thereby assessing the system's multimodal functionality. Our results indicate variation in performance across subjects, with laboratory skills standing out as the weakest. We also observe differences across languages, with English and European languages showing the strongest performance. Notably, the relative difficulty of an inventory item is largely independent of the language of the survey. When comparing AI results to existing literature on student performance, we find that the AI system outperforms average post-instruction undergraduate students in all subject categories except laboratory skills. Furthermore, the AI performs worse on items requiring visual interpretation of images than on those that are purely text-based. While our exploratory findings show GPT-4o's potential usefulness in physics education, they highlight the critical need for instructors to foster students' ability to critically evaluate AI outputs, adapt curricula thoughtfully in response to AI advancements, and address equity concerns associated with AI integration.

<title>Softplus Attention with Re-weighting Boosts Length Extrapolation in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in recent years, primarily due to the implementation of self-attention mechanisms. However, traditional Softmax attention suffers from numerical instability and reduced performance as the length of inference tokens increases. This paper addresses these issues by decomposing the Softmax operation into a non-linear transformation and the $l_1$-norm. We identify the latter as essential for maintaining model performance. By replacing the non-linear transformation with the Softplus activation function and introducing a dynamic scale factor for different token lengths based on invariance entropy, we create a novel attention mechanism with performance better than conventional Softmax attention across various inference lengths. To further improve the length extrapolation ability of the proposed attention mechanism, we introduce a novel re-weighting mechanism that amplifies significant attention weights while diminishing weaker ones, enabling the model to concentrate more effectively on relevant tokens. When combined with our proposed attention mechanism, this approach maintains nearly constant validation loss even at 16$\times$ the training token length, ensures numerical stability, and achieves superior results on downstream benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce the problem of formally verifying properties of Markov processes where the parameters are given by the output of machine learning models. For a broad class of machine learning models, including linear models, tree-based models, and neural networks, verifying properties of Markov chains like reachability, hitting time, and total reward can be formulated as a bilinear program. We develop a decomposition and bound propagation scheme for solving the bilinear program and show through computational experiments that our method solves the problem to global optimality up to 100x faster than state-of-the-art solvers. To demonstrate the practical utility of our approach, we apply it to a real-world healthcare case study. Along with the paper, we release markovml, an open-source tool for building Markov processes, integrating pretrained machine learning models, and verifying their properties, available at https://github.com/mmaaz-git/markovml.

Abstract: For almost 70 years, researchers have mostly relied on hyper-parameter tuning to select the width of neural networks' layers. This paper challenges the status quo by introducing an easy-to-use technique to learn an unbounded width of a neural network's layer during training. The technique does not rely on alternate optimization nor hand-crafted gradient heuristics; rather, it jointly optimizes the width and the parameters of each layer via simple backpropagation. We apply the technique to a broad range of data domains such as tables, images, text, sequences, and graphs, showing how the width adapts to the task's difficulty. The method imposes a soft ordering of importance among neurons, by which it also is possible to truncate the trained network at virtually zero cost, achieving a smooth trade-off between performance and compute resources in a structured way. Alternatively, one can dynamically compress the network with no performance degradation. In light of recent foundation models trained on large datasets, believed to require billions of parameters and where hyper-parameter tuning is unfeasible due to humongous training costs, our approach stands as a viable alternative for width learning.

Abstract: The growing scarcity of spectrum resources and rapid proliferation of wireless devices make efficient radio network management critical. While deep learning-enhanced Cognitive Radio Technology (CRT) provides promising solutions for tasks such as radio signal classification (RSC), denoising, and spectrum allocation, existing DL-based CRT frameworks are typically task-specific and lack scalability in diverse real-world applications. This limitation naturally leads to the exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs), whose exceptional cross-domain generalization capabilities offer new potential for advancing CRT. To bridge this gap, we propose RadioLLM, a novel framework that integrates Hybrid Prompt and Token Reprogramming (HPTR) for combining radio signal features with expert knowledge, and a Frequency-Attuned Fusion (FAF) module for enhanced high-frequency feature modeling. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that RadioLLM achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines in the majority of testing scenarios.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods via joint embedding architectures have proven remarkably effective at capturing semantically rich representations with strong clustering properties, magically in the absence of label supervision. Despite this, few of them have explored leveraging these untapped properties to improve themselves. In this paper, we provide an evidence through various metrics that the encoder's output $encoding$ exhibits superior and more stable clustering properties compared to other components. Building on this insight, we propose a novel positive-feedback SSL method, termed Representation Self-Assignment (ReSA), which leverages the model's clustering properties to promote learning in a self-guided manner. Extensive experiments on standard SSL benchmarks reveal that models pretrained with ReSA outperform other state-of-the-art SSL methods by a significant margin. Finally, we analyze how ReSA facilitates better clustering properties, demonstrating that it effectively enhances clustering performance at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels, shaping representations that are inherently more structured and semantically meaningful.

Abstract: To be considered reliable, a model must be calibrated so that its confidence in each decision closely reflects its true outcome. In this blogpost we'll take a look at the most commonly used definition for calibration and then dive into a frequently used evaluation measure for model calibration. We'll then cover some of the drawbacks of this measure and how these surfaced the need for additional notions of calibration, which require their own new evaluation measures. This post is not intended to be an in-depth dissection of all works on calibration, nor does it focus on how to calibrate models. Instead, it is meant to provide a gentle introduction to the different notions and their evaluation measures as well as to re-highlight some issues with a measure that is still widely used to evaluate calibration.

Abstract: How can we identify groups of primate individuals which could be conjectured to drive social structure? To address this question, one of us has collected a time series of data for social interactions between chimpanzees. Here we use a network representation, leading to the task of combining these data into a time series of a single weighted network per time stamp, where different proximities should be given different weights reflecting their relative importance. We optimize these proximity-type weights in a principled way, using an innovative loss function which rewards structural consistency across time. The approach is empirically validated by carefully designed synthetic data. Using statistical tests, we provide a way of identifying groups of individuals that stay related for a significant length of time. Applying the approach to the chimpanzee data set, we detect cliques in the animal social network time series, which can be validated by real-world intuition from prior research and qualitative observations by chimpanzee experts.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning agents face significant deployment challenges due to the synthetic-to-real distribution mismatch. While most prior research has focused on improving the fidelity of synthetic sampling and incorporating off-policy mechanisms, the directly integrated paradigm often fails to ensure consistent policy behavior in biased models and underlying environmental dynamics, which inherently arise from discrepancies between behavior and learning policies. In this paper, we first shift the focus from model reliability to policy discrepancies while optimizing for expected returns, and then self-consistently incorporate synthetic data, deriving a novel actor-critic paradigm, Dual Alignment Maximin Optimization (DAMO). It is a unified framework to ensure both model-environment policy consistency and synthetic and offline data compatibility. The inner minimization performs dual conservative value estimation, aligning policies and trajectories to avoid out-of-distribution states and actions, while the outer maximization ensures that policy improvements remain consistent with inner value estimates. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DAMO effectively ensures model and policy alignments, achieving competitive performance across diverse benchmark tasks.

Abstract: Symbolic writing systems are graphical semiotic codes that are ubiquitous in modern society but are otherwise absent in the animal kingdom. Anthropological evidence suggests that the earliest forms of some writing systems originally consisted of iconic pictographs, which signify their referent via visual resemblance. While previous studies have examined the emergence and, separately, the evolution of pictographic systems through a computational lens, most employ non-naturalistic methodologies that make it difficult to draw clear analogies to human and animal cognition. We develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning testbed for emergent communication called a Signification Game, and formulate a model of inferential communication that enables agents to leverage visual theory of mind to communicate actions using pictographs. Our model, which is situated within a broader formalism for animal communication, sheds light on the cognitive and cultural processes underlying the emergence of proto-writing.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient photorealistic novel view synthesis method. However, its reliance on sparse Structure-from-Motion (SfM) point clouds often limits scene reconstruction quality. To address the limitation, this paper proposes a novel 3D reconstruction framework, Gaussian Processes enhanced Gaussian Splatting (GP-GS), in which a multi-output Gaussian Process model is developed to enable adaptive and uncertainty-guided densification of sparse SfM point clouds. Specifically, we propose a dynamic sampling and filtering pipeline that adaptively expands the SfM point clouds by leveraging GP-based predictions to infer new candidate points from the input 2D pixels and depth maps. The pipeline utilizes uncertainty estimates to guide the pruning of high-variance predictions, ensuring geometric consistency and enabling the generation of dense point clouds. These densified point clouds provide high-quality initial 3D Gaussians, enhancing reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets across various scales validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Instructional designers face an overwhelming array of design choices, making it challenging to identify the most effective interventions. To address this issue, I propose the concept of a Model Human Learner, a unified computational model of learning that can aid designers in evaluating candidate interventions. This paper presents the first successful demonstration of this concept, showing that a computational model can accurately predict the outcomes of two human A/B experiments -- one testing a problem sequencing intervention and the other testing an item design intervention. It also demonstrates that such a model can generate learning curves without requiring human data and provide theoretical insights into why an instructional intervention is effective. These findings lay the groundwork for future Model Human Learners that integrate cognitive and learning theories to support instructional design across diverse tasks and interventions.

Abstract: Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is the lack of robotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot operation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as action-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we posit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more effective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that directly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level VLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The intermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates the high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the low-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with the hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant domain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing scenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances and task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average of 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of generalization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

Abstract: Efficient exploration is critical for learning relational models in large-scale environments with complex, long-horizon tasks. Random exploration methods often collect redundant or irrelevant data, limiting their ability to learn accurate relational models of the environment. Goal-literal babbling (GLIB) improves upon random exploration by setting and planning to novel goals, but its reliance on random actions and random novel goal selection limits its scalability to larger domains. In this work, we identify the principles underlying efficient exploration in relational domains: (1) operator initialization with demonstrations that cover the distinct lifted effects necessary for planning and (2) refining preconditions to collect maximally informative transitions by selecting informative goal-action pairs and executing plans to them. To demonstrate these principles, we introduce Baking-Large, a challenging domain with extensive state-action spaces and long-horizon tasks. We evaluate methods using oracle-driven demonstrations for operator initialization and precondition-targeting guidance to efficiently gather critical transitions. Experiments show that both the oracle demonstrations and precondition-targeting oracle guidance significantly improve sample efficiency and generalization, paving the way for future methods to use these principles to efficiently learn accurate relational models in complex domains.

Abstract: In recent years, several personalized assistants based on AI have been researched and developed to help users make privacy-related decisions. These AI-driven Personalized Privacy Assistants (AI-driven PPAs) can provide significant benefits for users, who might otherwise struggle with making decisions about their personal data in online environments that often overload them with different privacy decision requests. So far, no studies have systematically investigated the emerging topic of AI-driven PPAs, classifying their underlying technologies, architecture and features, including decision types or the accuracy of their decisions. To fill this gap, we present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to map the existing solutions found in the scientific literature, which allows reasoning about existing approaches and open challenges for this research field. We screened several hundred unique research papers over the recent years (2013-2025), constructing a classification from 41 included papers. As a result, this SLR reviews several aspects of existing research on AI-driven PPAs in terms of types of publications, contributions, methodological quality, and other quantitative insights. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification for AI-driven PPAs, delving into their architectural choices, system contexts, types of AI used, data sources, types of decisions, and control over decisions, among other facets. Based on our SLR, we further underline the research gaps and challenges and formulate recommendations for the design and development of AI-driven PPAs as well as avenues for future research.

Abstract: Estimating individualised treatment effect (ITE) -- that is the causal effect of a set of variables (also called exposures, treatments, actions, policies, or interventions), referred to as \textit{composite treatments}, on a set of outcome variables of interest, referred to as \textit{composite outcomes}, for a unit from observational data -- remains a fundamental problem in causal inference with applications across disciplines, such as healthcare, economics, education, social science, marketing, and computer science. Previous work in causal machine learning for ITE estimation is limited to simple settings, like single treatments and single outcomes. This hinders their use in complex real-world scenarios; for example, consider studying the effect of different ICU interventions, such as beta-blockers and statins for a patient admitted for heart surgery, on different outcomes of interest such as atrial fibrillation and in-hospital mortality. The limited research into composite treatments and outcomes is primarily due to data scarcity for all treatments and outcomes. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel and innovative hypernetwork-based approach, called \emph{H-Learner}, to solve ITE estimation under composite treatments and composite outcomes, which tackles the data scarcity issue by dynamically sharing information across treatments and outcomes. Our empirical analysis with binary and arbitrary composite treatments and outcomes demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of urban spatiotemporal dynamics is essential for enhancing urban management and decision-making. Existing spatiotemporal prediction models are predominantly deterministic, focusing on primary spatiotemporal patterns. However, those dynamics are highly complex, exhibiting multi-modal distributions that are challenging for deterministic models to capture. In this paper, we highlight the critical role of probabilistic prediction in capturing the uncertainties and complexities inherent in spatiotemporal data. While mainstream probabilistic models can capture uncertainty, they struggle with accurately learning primary patterns and often suffer from computational inefficiency. To address these challenges, we propose CoST, which collaborates deterministic and probabilistic models to improve both predictive accuracy and the ability to handle uncertainty. To achieve this, we design a mean-residual decomposition framework, where the mean value is modeled by a deterministic model, and the residual variations are learned by a probabilistic model, specifically diffusion models. Moreover, we introduce a scale-aware diffusion process, which better accounts for spatially heterogeneous dynamics across different regions. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that CoST significantly outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic metrics, achieving a 20% improvement with low computational cost. CoST bridges the gap between deterministic precision and probabilistic uncertainty, making a significant advancement in the field of urban spatiotemporal prediction.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLM) demonstrate sophisticated multimodal reasoning yet are prone to hallucination when confronted with knowledge conflicts, impeding their deployment in information-sensitive contexts. While existing research addresses robustness in unimodal models, the multimodal domain lacks systematic investigation of cross-modal knowledge conflicts. This research introduces \segsub, a framework for applying targeted image perturbations to investigate VLM resilience against knowledge conflicts. Our analysis reveals distinct vulnerability patterns: while VLMs are robust to parametric conflicts (20% adherence rates), they exhibit significant weaknesses in identifying counterfactual conditions (<30% accuracy) and resolving source conflicts (<1% accuracy). Correlations between contextual richness and hallucination rate (r = -0.368, p = 0.003) reveal the kinds of images that are likely to cause hallucinations. Through targeted fine-tuning on our benchmark dataset, we demonstrate improvements in VLM knowledge conflict detection, establishing a foundation for developing hallucination-resilient multimodal systems in information-sensitive environments.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a potent diagnostic tool for detecting pathological tissues in various diseases. Different MRI sequences have different contrast mechanisms and sensitivities for different types of lesions, which pose challenges to accurate and consistent lesion segmentation. In clinical practice, radiologists commonly use the sub-sequence feature, i.e. the difference between post contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (post) and pre-contrast-enhanced (pre) sequences, to locate lesions. Inspired by this, we propose a residual fusion method to learn subsequence representation for MRI lesion segmentation. Specifically, we iteratively and adaptively fuse features from pre- and post-contrast sequences at multiple resolutions, using dynamic weights to achieve optimal fusion and address diverse lesion enhancement patterns. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performances on BraTS2023 dataset for brain tumor segmentation and our in-house breast MRI dataset for breast lesion segmentation. Our method is clinically inspired and has the potential to facilitate lesion segmentation in various applications.

Abstract: The rise of misinformation, exacerbated by Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT and Gemini, demands robust fact-checking solutions, especially for low-resource languages like Vietnamese. Existing methods struggle with semantic ambiguity, homonyms, and complex linguistic structures, often trading accuracy for efficiency. We introduce SemViQA, a novel Vietnamese fact-checking framework integrating Semantic-based Evidence Retrieval (SER) and Two-step Verdict Classification (TVC). Our approach balances precision and speed, achieving state-of-the-art results with 78.97\% strict accuracy on ISE-DSC01 and 80.82\% on ViWikiFC, securing 1st place in the UIT Data Science Challenge. Additionally, SemViQA Faster improves inference speed 7x while maintaining competitive accuracy. SemViQA sets a new benchmark for Vietnamese fact verification, advancing the fight against misinformation. The source code is available at: https://github.com/DAVID-NGUYEN-S16/SemViQA.

Abstract: SemEval-2025 Task 3 (Mu-SHROOM) focuses on detecting hallucinations in content generated by various large language models (LLMs) across multiple languages. This task involves not only identifying the presence of hallucinations but also pinpointing their specific occurrences. To tackle this challenge, this study introduces two methods: modified RefChecker and modified SelfCheckGPT. The modified RefChecker integrates prompt-based factual verification into References, structuring them as claim-based tests rather than single external knowledge sources. The modified SelfCheckGPT incorporates external knowledge to overcome its reliance on internal knowledge. In addition, both methods' original prompt designs are enhanced to identify hallucinated words within LLM-generated texts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving a high ranking on the test dataset in detecting hallucinations across various languages, with an average IoU of 0.5310 and an average COR of 0.5669.

Abstract: Multimodal Reward Models (MM-RMs) are crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, particularly as LLMs increasingly interact with multimodal data. However, we find that MM-RMs trained on existing datasets often struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution data due to their reliance on unimodal spurious correlations, primarily text-only shortcuts within the training distribution, which prevents them from leveraging true multimodal reward functions. To address this, we introduce a Shortcut-aware MM-RM learning algorithm that mitigates this issue by dynamically reweighting training samples, shifting the distribution toward better multimodal understanding, and reducing dependence on unimodal spurious correlations. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in generalization, downstream task performance, and scalability, establishing a more robust framework for multimodal reward modeling.

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that layer attention mechanisms, which enhance interaction among layers in deep neural networks, have significantly advanced network architectures. However, existing layer attention methods suffer from redundancy, as attention weights learned by adjacent layers often become highly similar. This redundancy causes multiple layers to extract nearly identical features, reducing the model's representational capacity and increasing training time. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to quantify redundancy by leveraging the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between adjacent layers. Additionally, we introduce an Enhanced Beta Quantile Mapping (EBQM) method that accurately identifies and skips redundant layers, thereby maintaining model stability. Our proposed Efficient Layer Attention (ELA) architecture, improves both training efficiency and overall performance, achieving a 30% reduction in training time while enhancing performance in tasks such as image classification and object detection.

<title>TGBFormer: Transformer-GraphFormer Blender Network for Video Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Video object detection has made significant progress in recent years thanks to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). Typically, CNNs excel at capturing local features but struggle to model global representations. Conversely, ViTs are adept at capturing long-range global features but face challenges in representing local feature details. Off-the-shelf video object detection methods solely rely on CNNs or ViTs to conduct feature aggregation, which hampers their capability to simultaneously leverage global and local information, thereby resulting in limited detection performance. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-GraphFormer Blender Network (TGBFormer) for video object detection, with three key technical improvements to fully exploit the advantages of transformers and graph convolutional networks while compensating for their limitations. First, we develop a spatial-temporal transformer module to aggregate global contextual information, constituting global representations with long-range feature dependencies. Second, we introduce a spatial-temporal GraphFormer module that utilizes local spatial and temporal relationships to aggregate features, generating new local representations that are complementary to the transformer outputs. Third, we design a global-local feature blender module to adaptively couple transformer-based global representations and GraphFormer-based local representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TGBFormer establishes new state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet VID dataset. Particularly, our TGBFormer achieves 86.5% mAP while running at around 41.0 FPS on a single Tesla A100 GPU.

Abstract: Linear RNNs with gating recently demonstrated competitive performance compared to Transformers in language modeling. Although their linear compute scaling in sequence length offers theoretical runtime advantages over Transformers, realizing these benefits in practice requires optimized custom kernels, as Transformers rely on the highly efficient Flash Attention kernels (Dao, 2024). Leveraging the chunkwise-parallel formulation of linear RNNs, Flash Linear Attention (FLA) (Yang & Zhang, 2024) shows that linear RNN kernels are faster than Flash Attention, by parallelizing over chunks of the input sequence. However, since the chunk size of FLA is limited, many intermediate states must be materialized in GPU memory. This leads to low arithmetic intensity and causes high memory consumption and IO cost, especially for long-context pre-training. In this work, we present Tiled Flash Linear Attention (TFLA), a novel kernel algorithm for linear RNNs, that enables arbitrary large chunk sizes and high arithmetic intensity by introducing an additional level of sequence parallelization within each chunk. First, we apply TFLA to the xLSTM with matrix memory, the mLSTM (Beck et al., 2024). Second, we propose an mLSTM variant with sigmoid input gate and reduced computation for even faster kernel runtimes at equal language modeling performance. In our speed benchmarks, we show that our new mLSTM kernels based on TFLA outperform highly optimized Flash Attention, Linear Attention and Mamba kernels, setting a new state of the art for efficient long-context sequence modeling primitives.

Abstract: The promising potential of AI and network convergence in improving networking performance and enabling new service capabilities has recently attracted significant interest. Existing network AI solutions, while powerful, are mainly built based on the close-loop and passive learning framework, resulting in major limitations in autonomous solution finding and dynamic environmental adaptation. Agentic AI has recently been introduced as a promising solution to address the above limitations and pave the way for true generally intelligent and beneficial AI systems. The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.

Abstract: Generative retrieval (GR) has revolutionized document retrieval with the advent of large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based GR is gradually being adopted by the industry. Despite its remarkable advantages and potential, LLM-based GR suffers from hallucination and generates documents that are irrelevant to the query in some instances, severely challenging its credibility in practical applications. We thereby propose an optimized GR framework designed to alleviate retrieval hallucination, which integrates knowledge distillation reasoning in model training and incorporate decision agent to further improve retrieval precision. Specifically, we employ LLMs to assess and reason GR retrieved query-document (q-d) pairs, and then distill the reasoning data as transferred knowledge to the GR model. Moreover, we utilize a decision agent as post-processing to extend the GR retrieved documents through retrieval model and select the most relevant ones from multi perspectives as the final generative retrieval result. Extensive offline experiments on real-world datasets and online A/B tests on Fund Search and Insurance Search in Alipay demonstrate our framework's superiority and effectiveness in improving search quality and conversion gains.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are highly regarded for their energy efficiency, inherent activation sparsity, and suitability for real-time processing in edge devices. However, most current SNN methods adopt architectures resembling traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), leading to suboptimal performance when applied to SNNs. While SNNs excel in energy efficiency, they have been associated with lower accuracy levels than traditional ANNs when utilizing conventional architectures. In response, in this work we present LightSNN, a rapid and efficient Neural Network Architecture Search (NAS) technique specifically tailored for SNNs that autonomously leverages the most suitable architecture, striking a good balance between accuracy and efficiency by enforcing sparsity. Based on the spiking NAS network (SNASNet) framework, a cell-based search space including backward connections is utilized to build our training-free pruning-based NAS mechanism. Our technique assesses diverse spike activation patterns across different data samples using a sparsity-aware Hamming distance fitness evaluation. Thorough experiments are conducted on both static (CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) and neuromorphic datasets (DVS128-Gesture). Our LightSNN model achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, improves performance on DVS128Gesture by 4.49\%, and significantly reduces search time most notably offering a $98\times$ speedup over SNASNet and running 30\% faster than the best existing method on DVS128Gesture.

Abstract: Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, necessitating the development of accurate and reliable predictive models to facilitate early detection and intervention. While state of the art work has focused on various machine learning approaches for predicting heart disease, but they could not able to achieve remarkable accuracy. In response to this need, we applied nine machine learning algorithms XGBoost, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), gaussian na\"ive bayes (NB gaussian), adaptive boosting, and linear regression to predict heart disease based on a range of physiological indicators. Our approach involved feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant predictors, aimed at refining the models to enhance both performance and interpretability. The models were trained, incorporating processes such as grid search hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to minimize overfitting. Additionally, we have developed a novel voting system with feature selection techniques to advance heart disease classification. Furthermore, we have evaluated the models using key performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC). Among the models, XGBoost demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 99% accuracy, precision, F1-Score, 98% recall, and 100% ROC AUC. This study offers a promising approach to early heart disease diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit the interplay between text and visual content in multimodal foundation models, causing misclassifications when misleading text is embedded within images. However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. We publicly release the datasets introduced in this paper along with the code for evaluations at www.bliss.berlin/research/scam.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed human-computer interaction by enabling natural language-based communication with AI-powered chatbots. These models are designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to articulate requests with minimal effort. However, despite their accessibility, studies reveal that users often struggle with effective prompting, resulting in inefficient responses. Existing research has highlighted both the limitations of LLMs in interpreting vague or poorly structured prompts and the difficulties users face in crafting precise queries. This study investigates learner-AI interactions through an educational experiment in which participants receive structured guidance on effective prompting. We introduce and compare three types of prompting guidelines: a task-specific framework developed through a structured methodology and two baseline approaches. To assess user behavior and prompting efficacy, we analyze a dataset of 642 interactions from 107 users. Using Von NeuMidas, an extended pragmatic annotation schema for LLM interaction analysis, we categorize common prompting errors and identify recurring behavioral patterns. We then evaluate the impact of different guidelines by examining changes in user behavior, adherence to prompting strategies, and the overall quality of AI-generated responses. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of how users engage with LLMs and the role of structured prompting guidance in enhancing AI-assisted communication. By comparing different instructional frameworks, we offer insights into more effective approaches for improving user competency in AI interactions, with implications for AI literacy, chatbot usability, and the design of more responsive AI systems.

Abstract: The growing integration of robots in shared environments -- such as warehouses, shopping centres, and hospitals -- demands a deep understanding of the underlying dynamics and human behaviours, including how, when, and where individuals engage in various activities and interactions. This knowledge goes beyond simple correlation studies and requires a more comprehensive causal analysis. By leveraging causal inference to model cause-and-effect relationships, we can better anticipate critical environmental factors and enable autonomous robots to plan and execute tasks more effectively. To this end, we propose a novel causality-based decision-making framework that reasons over a learned causal model to predict battery usage and human obstructions, understanding how these factors could influence robot task execution. Such reasoning framework assists the robot in deciding when and how to complete a given task. To achieve this, we developed also PeopleFlow, a new Gazebo-based simulator designed to model context-sensitive human-robot spatial interactions in shared workspaces. PeopleFlow features realistic human and robot trajectories influenced by contextual factors such as time, environment layout, and robot state, and can simulate a large number of agents. While the simulator is general-purpose, in this paper we focus on a warehouse-like environment as a case study, where we conduct an extensive evaluation benchmarking our causal approach against a non-causal baseline. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solutions, highlighting how causal reasoning enables autonomous robots to operate more efficiently and safely in dynamic environments shared with humans.

Abstract: Molecular generation plays an important role in drug discovery and materials science, especially in data-scarce scenarios where traditional generative models often struggle to achieve satisfactory conditional generalization. To address this challenge, we propose MetaMolGen, a first-order meta-learning-based molecular generator designed for few-shot and property-conditioned molecular generation. MetaMolGen standardizes the distribution of graph motifs by mapping them to a normalized latent space, and employs a lightweight autoregressive sequence model to generate SMILES sequences that faithfully reflect the underlying molecular structure. In addition, it supports conditional generation of molecules with target properties through a learnable property projector integrated into the generative process.Experimental results demonstrate that MetaMolGen consistently generates valid and diverse SMILES sequences under low-data regimes, outperforming conventional baselines. This highlights its advantage in fast adaptation and efficient conditional generation for practical molecular design.

Abstract: Unstructured clinical data can serve as a unique and rich source of information that can meaningfully inform clinical practice. Extracting the most pertinent context from such data is critical for exploiting its true potential toward optimal and timely decision-making in patient care. While prior research has explored various methods for clinical text summarization, most prior studies either process all input tokens uniformly or rely on heuristic-based filters, which can overlook nuanced clinical cues and fail to prioritize information critical for decision-making. In this study, we propose Contextual, a novel framework that integrates a Context-Preserving Token Filtering method with a Domain-Specific Knowledge Graph (KG) for contextual augmentation. By preserving context-specific important tokens and enriching them with structured knowledge, ConTextual improves both linguistic coherence and clinical fidelity. Our extensive empirical evaluations on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConTextual consistently outperforms other baselines. Our proposed approach highlights the complementary role of token-level filtering and structured retrieval in enhancing both linguistic and clinical integrity, as well as offering a scalable solution for improving precision in clinical text generation.

Abstract: We present DyMU, an efficient, training-free framework that dynamically reduces the computational burden of vision-language models (VLMs) while maintaining high task performance. Our approach comprises two key components. First, Dynamic Token Merging (DToMe) reduces the number of visual token embeddings by merging similar tokens based on image complexity, addressing the inherent inefficiency of fixed-length outputs in vision transformers. Second, Virtual Token Unmerging (VTU) simulates the expected token sequence for large language models (LLMs) by efficiently reconstructing the attention dynamics of a full sequence, thus preserving the downstream performance without additional fine-tuning. Unlike previous approaches, our method dynamically adapts token compression to the content of the image and operates completely training-free, making it readily applicable to most state-of-the-art VLM architectures. Extensive experiments on image and video understanding tasks demonstrate that DyMU can reduce the average visual token count by 32%-85% while achieving comparable performance to full-length models across diverse VLM architectures, including the recently popularized AnyRes-based visual encoders. Furthermore, through qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that DToMe effectively adapts token reduction based on image complexity and, unlike existing systems, provides users more control over computational costs.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality synthetic data presents significant challenges in machine learning research, particularly regarding statistical fidelity and uncertainty quantification. Existing generative models produce compelling synthetic samples but lack rigorous statistical guarantees about their relation to the underlying data distribution, limiting their applicability in critical domains requiring robust error bounds. We address this fundamental limitation by presenting a novel framework that incorporates conformal prediction methodologies into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By integrating multiple conformal prediction paradigms including Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP), Mondrian Conformal Prediction, Cross-Conformal Prediction, and Venn-Abers Predictors, we establish distribution-free uncertainty quantification in generated samples. This approach, termed Conformalized GAN (cGAN), demonstrates enhanced calibration properties while maintaining the generative power of traditional GANs, producing synthetic data with provable statistical guarantees. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing finite-sample validity guarantees and asymptotic efficiency properties, enabling the reliable application of synthetic data in high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Lay summaries for scientific documents typically include explanations to help readers grasp sophisticated concepts or arguments. However, current automatic summarization methods do not explicitly model explanations, which makes it difficult to align the proportion of explanatory content with human-written summaries. In this paper, we present a plan-based approach that leverages discourse frameworks to organize summary generation and guide explanatory sentences by prompting responses to the plan. Specifically, we propose two discourse-driven planning strategies, where the plan is conditioned as part of the input or part of the output prefix, respectively. Empirical experiments on three lay summarization datasets show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of summary quality, and it enhances model robustness, controllability, and mitigates hallucination.

Abstract: The increasing use of complex machine learning models in education has led to concerns about their interpretability, which in turn has spurred interest in developing explainability techniques that are both faithful to the model's inner workings and intelligible to human end-users. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to creating a neural-network-based behavior detection model that is interpretable by design. Our model is fully interpretable, meaning that the parameters we extract for our explanations have a clear interpretation, fully capture the model's learned knowledge about the learner behavior of interest, and can be used to create explanations that are both faithful and intelligible. We achieve this by implementing a series of constraints to the model that both simplify its inference process and bring it closer to a human conception of the task at hand. We train the model to detect gaming-the-system behavior, evaluate its performance on this task, and compare its learned patterns to those identified by human experts. Our results show that the model is successfully able to learn patterns indicative of gaming-the-system behavior while providing evidence for fully interpretable explanations. We discuss the implications of our approach and suggest ways to evaluate explainability using a human-grounded approach.

Abstract: We propose reinforcement learning (RL) strategies tailored for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) under strict memory and compute limits, with a particular focus on compatibility with LoRA fine-tuning. Building on early policy gradient methods with baseline subtraction, we design critic-free methods that operate on a small, informative subset of output tokens to reduce memory usage and stabilize training. We introduce S-GRPO, a stochastic variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, and T-SPMO, a token-level prefix matching approach for fine-grained credit assignment. Applied to Qwen2-1.5B, our methods raise accuracy on the SVAMP benchmark from 46% to over 70% and show strong performance on multi-digit multiplication. Surprisingly, full-token GRPO under LoRA fails to improve over the base model, suggesting that selective token-level optimization may act as an implicit regularizer in low-parameter training regimes.

Abstract: User authentication is essential to ensure secure access to computer systems, yet traditional methods face limitations in usability, cost, and security. Mouse dynamics authentication, based on the analysis of users' natural interaction behaviors with mouse devices, offers a cost-effective, non-intrusive, and adaptable solution. However, challenges remain in determining the optimal data volume, balancing accuracy and practicality, and effectively capturing temporal behavioral patterns. In this study, we propose a statistical method using Gaussian kernel density estimate (KDE) and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to estimate the sufficient data volume for training authentication models. We introduce the Mouse Authentication Unit (MAU), leveraging Approximate Entropy (ApEn) to optimize segment length for efficient and accurate behavioral representation. Furthermore, we design the Local-Time Mouse Authentication (LT-AMouse) framework, integrating 1D-ResNet for local feature extraction and GRU for modeling long-term temporal dependencies. Taking the Balabit and DFL datasets as examples, we significantly reduced the data scale, particularly by a factor of 10 for the DFL dataset, greatly alleviating the training burden. Additionally, we determined the optimal input recognition unit length for the user authentication system on different datasets based on the slope of Approximate Entropy. Training with imbalanced samples, our model achieved a successful defense AUC 98.52% for blind attack on the DFL dataset and 94.65% on the Balabit dataset, surpassing the current sota performance.

Abstract: Garment sewing patterns are fundamental design elements that bridge the gap between design concepts and practical manufacturing. The generative modeling of sewing patterns is crucial for creating diversified garments. However, existing approaches are limited either by reliance on a single input modality or by suboptimal generation efficiency. In this work, we present GarmentDiffusion, a new generative model capable of producing centimeter-precise, vectorized 3D sewing patterns from multimodal inputs (text, image, and incomplete sewing pattern). Our method efficiently encodes 3D sewing pattern parameters into compact edge token representations, achieving a sequence length that is 10 times shorter than that of the autoregressive SewingGPT in DressCode. By employing a diffusion transformer, we simultaneously denoise all edge tokens along the temporal axis, while maintaining a constant number of denoising steps regardless of dataset-specific edge and panel statistics. With all combination of designs of our model, the sewing pattern generation speed is accelerated by 100 times compared to SewingGPT. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on DressCodeData, as well as on the largest sewing pattern dataset, namely GarmentCodeData.

Abstract: Enabling large language models with external tools has become a pivotal strategy for extending their functionality beyond text space. To enhance LLMs' tool-calling abilities, previous approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with trajectories distilled from stronger models, often resulting in imitative reasoning that limits generalization. In this work, we explore rule-based reinforcement learning to enhance tool-calling in LLMs, resulting in Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1, a series of tool-calling reasoning models. Rather than enforcing supervision over intermediate distilled reasoning traces, Tool-N1 is trained with a binary RL reward that assesses only the format validity and functional correctness of tool invocations. This lightweight supervision allows the model to develop reasoning strategies independently, without relying on annotated trajectories. Experiments on several major benchmarks show that Tool-N1-7B/14B clearly outperform GPT-4o. We conduct a systematic study on the design of rule-based reinforcement learning strategies for training tool-calling models. Using 5,518 distilled reasoning trajectories, we compare SFT, RL, and the SFT-then-RL pipeline, finding that the widely adopted SFT-then-RL paradigm does not necessarily outperform pure RL.

Abstract: Purpose: This study presents a Deep Learning (DL)-based quality assessment (QA) approach for evaluating auto-generated contours (auto-contours) in radiotherapy, with emphasis on Online Adaptive Radiotherapy (OART). Leveraging Bayesian Ordinal Classification (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds, the method enables confident QA predictions without relying on ground truth contours or extensive manual labeling. Methods: We developed a BOC model to classify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A calibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical accuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual labels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate cancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent, transfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were available. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all scenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34 subjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated threshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted in over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting cases needing correction. Conclusion: The proposed QA model enhances contouring efficiency in OART by reducing manual workload and enabling fast, informed clinical decisions. Through uncertainty quantification, it ensures safer, more reliable radiotherapy workflows.

Abstract: One of the central challenges preventing robots from acquiring complex manipulation skills is the prohibitive cost of collecting large-scale robot demonstrations. In contrast, humans are able to learn efficiently by watching others interact with their environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce semantic action flow as a core intermediate representation capturing the essential spatio-temporal manipulator-object interactions, invariant to superficial visual differences. We present ViSA-Flow, a framework that learns this representation self-supervised from unlabeled large-scale video data. First, a generative model is pre-trained on semantic action flows automatically extracted from large-scale human-object interaction video data, learning a robust prior over manipulation structure. Second, this prior is efficiently adapted to a target robot by fine-tuning on a small set of robot demonstrations processed through the same semantic abstraction pipeline. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the CALVIN benchmark and real-world tasks that ViSA-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in low-data regimes, outperforming prior methods by effectively transferring knowledge from human video observation to robotic execution.

<div> Keywords: AI safety evaluations, capabilities, propensities, control, governance

Summary:
AI safety evaluations are crucial as AI systems advance, requiring a shift in how we measure and assess them. Benchmarks are insufficient for estimating capabilities, prompting the need for a new approach. This literature review introduces a systematic taxonomy for AI safety evaluations based on what properties are measured, how they are measured, and how these measurements integrate into frameworks. Evaluations focus on capabilities (measuring limits), propensities (default behavioral tendencies), and control (subversive adversarial AI). Methods such as scaffolding, red teaming, and representation analysis are utilized. Safety-critical capabilities like cybersecurity exploitation and concerning propensities like power-seeking are explored. The integration of evaluation methods into governance frameworks is essential for informed decision-making. Challenges such as proving absence of capabilities and incentives for "safetywashing" are identified alongside promising research directions. This review serves as a central reference point for understanding AI safety evaluations.

Abstract: As frontier AI systems advance toward transformative capabilities, we need a parallel transformation in how we measure and evaluate these systems to ensure safety and inform governance. While benchmarks have been the primary method for estimating model capabilities, they often fail to establish true upper bounds or predict deployment behavior. This literature review consolidates the rapidly evolving field of AI safety evaluations, proposing a systematic taxonomy around three dimensions: what properties we measure, how we measure them, and how these measurements integrate into frameworks. We show how evaluations go beyond benchmarks by measuring what models can do when pushed to the limit (capabilities), the behavioral tendencies exhibited by default (propensities), and whether our safety measures remain effective even when faced with subversive adversarial AI (control). These properties are measured through behavioral techniques like scaffolding, red teaming and supervised fine-tuning, alongside internal techniques such as representation analysis and mechanistic interpretability. We provide deeper explanations of some safety-critical capabilities like cybersecurity exploitation, deception, autonomous replication, and situational awareness, alongside concerning propensities like power-seeking and scheming. The review explores how these evaluation methods integrate into governance frameworks to translate results into concrete development decisions. We also highlight challenges to safety evaluations - proving absence of capabilities, potential model sandbagging, and incentives for "safetywashing" - while identifying promising research directions. By synthesizing scattered resources, this literature review aims to provide a central reference point for understanding AI safety evaluations.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI systems evolve, robustly estimating their capabilities from inherently stochastic outputs while systematically quantifying uncertainty in these estimates becomes increasingly important. Further, advanced AI evaluations often have a nested hierarchical structure, exhibit high levels of complexity, and come with high costs in testing the most advanced AI systems. To address these challenges, we introduce HiBayES, a generalizable Hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework for AI Evaluation Statistics. HiBayES supports robust inferences in classical question-answer benchmarks and advanced agentic evaluations, particularly in low-data scenarios (e.g., < 20 data points per evaluation). Built on Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Bayesian data analysis, and formal model comparison, HiBayES provides principled uncertainty quantification and robust parameter estimation. This paper offers a comprehensive introduction to HiBayES, including illustrative examples, comparisons to conventional statistical methods, and practical guidance for implementing multilevel Bayesian GLMs. Additionally, we provide a HiBayES software package [4] (Beta version) for out-of-the-box implementation.

Abstract: Drug resistance presents a major challenge in cancer therapy. Single cell profiling offers insights into cellular heterogeneity, yet the application of large-scale foundation models for predicting drug response in single cell data remains underexplored. To address this, we developed scDrugMap, an integrated framework featuring both a Python command-line interface and a web server for drug response prediction. scDrugMap evaluates a wide range of foundation models, including eight single-cell models and two large language models, using a curated dataset of over 326,000 cells in the primary collection and 18,800 cells in the validation set, spanning 36 datasets and diverse tissue and cancer types. We benchmarked model performance under pooled-data and cross-data evaluation settings, employing both layer freezing and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning strategies. In the pooled-data scenario, scFoundation achieved the best performance, with mean F1 scores of 0.971 (layer freezing) and 0.947 (fine-tuning), outperforming the lowest-performing model by over 50%. In the cross-data setting, UCE excelled post fine-tuning (mean F1: 0.774), while scGPT led in zero-shot learning (mean F1: 0.858). Overall, scDrugMap provides the first large-scale benchmark of foundation models for drug response prediction in single-cell data and serves as a user-friendly, flexible platform for advancing drug discovery and translational research.

Abstract: Predicting enzymatic reactions is crucial for applications in biocatalysis, metabolic engineering, and drug discovery, yet it remains a complex and resource-intensive task. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in various scientific domains, e.g., through their ability to generalize knowledge, reason over complex structures, and leverage in-context learning strategies. In this study, we systematically evaluate the capability of LLMs, particularly the Llama-3.1 family (8B and 70B), across three core biochemical tasks: Enzyme Commission number prediction, forward synthesis, and retrosynthesis. We compare single-task and multitask learning strategies, employing parameter-efficient fine-tuning via LoRA adapters. Additionally, we assess performance across different data regimes to explore their adaptability in low-data settings. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs capture biochemical knowledge, with multitask learning enhancing forward- and retrosynthesis predictions by leveraging shared enzymatic information. We also identify key limitations, for example challenges in hierarchical EC classification schemes, highlighting areas for further improvement in LLM-driven biochemical modeling.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel prompted meta-learning framework, PromptMeta, for few-shot knowledge graph completion (KGC) that integrates meta-semantics and relational information. The framework includes a meta-semantic prompt pool to capture high-level meta-semantics for knowledge transfer and a learnable fusion prompt to combine meta-semantic and task-specific relational information. Both components are optimized within a meta-learning framework. The approach is tested on two benchmark datasets and demonstrates effectiveness in leveraging rich semantics for few-shot KGC tasks. <div>
arXiv:2505.05684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph completion (KGC) has obtained significant attention due to its practical applications in real-world scenarios, where new knowledge often emerges with limited available data. While most existing methods for few-shot KGC have predominantly focused on leveraging relational information, rich semantics inherent in KGs have been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we propose a novel prompted meta-learning (PromptMeta) framework that seamlessly integrates meta-semantics with relational information for few-shot KGC. PrompMeta has two key innovations: (1) a meta-semantic prompt pool that captures and consolidates high-level meta-semantics, enabling effective knowledge transfer and adaptation to rare and newly emerging relations. (2) a learnable fusion prompt that dynamically combines meta-semantic information with task-specific relational information tailored to different few-shot tasks. Both components are optimized together with model parameters within a meta-learning framework. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.05701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy from a static dataset without further interactions with the environment. Collecting sufficiently large datasets for offline RL is exhausting since this data collection requires colossus interactions with environments and becomes tricky when the interaction with the environment is restricted. Hence, how an agent learns the best policy with a minimal static dataset is a crucial issue in offline RL, similar to the sample efficiency problem in online RL. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play pretraining method to initialize a feature of a $Q$-network to enhance data efficiency in offline RL. Specifically, we introduce a shared $Q$-network structure that outputs predictions of the next state and $Q$-value. We pretrain the shared $Q$-network through a supervised regression task that predicts a next state and trains the shared $Q$-network using diverse offline RL methods. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing popular offline RL methods on the D4RL, Robomimic and V-D4RL benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that our method significantly boosts data-efficient offline RL across various data qualities and data distributions trough D4RL and ExoRL benchmarks. Notably, our method adapted with only 10% of the dataset outperforms standard algorithms even with full datasets.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces APOLLO, a pipeline that combines Lean compiler with large language models (LLMs) to improve proof-generation results with low sampling budget. It automates the process of LLM generating proofs, analysis by agents, error fixing, mistake identification using Lean, failure isolation, solver use, and re-verification. APOLLO achieved a state-of-the-art 75.0% accuracy on the miniF2F benchmark with a sampling budget below 1000. It also raised accuracy for Goedel-Prover-SFT to 65.6% and significantly improved general-purpose models' accuracy. The targeted, compiler-guided repair of LLM outputs proved to enhance efficiency and correctness, showcasing a promising approach for scalable automated theorem proving.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.05758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal reasoning and automated theorem proving constitute a challenging subfield of machine learning, in which machines are tasked with proving mathematical theorems using formal languages like Lean. A formal verification system can check whether a formal proof is correct or not almost instantaneously, but generating a completely correct formal proof with large language models (LLMs) remains a formidable task. The usual approach in the literature is to prompt the LLM many times (up to several thousands) until one of the generated proofs passes the verification system. In this work, we present APOLLO (Automated PrOof repair via LLM and Lean cOllaboration), a modular, model-agnostic pipeline that combines the strengths of the Lean compiler with an LLM's reasoning abilities to achieve better proof-generation results at a low sampling budget. Apollo directs a fully automated process in which the LLM generates proofs for theorems, a set of agents analyze the proofs, fix the syntax errors, identify the mistakes in the proofs using Lean, isolate failing sub-lemmas, utilize automated solvers, and invoke an LLM on each remaining goal with a low top-K budget. The repaired sub-proofs are recombined and reverified, iterating up to a user-controlled maximum number of attempts. On the miniF2F benchmark, we establish a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 75.0% among 7B-parameter models while keeping the sampling budget below one thousand. Moreover, Apollo raises the state-of-the-art accuracy for Goedel-Prover-SFT to 65.6% while cutting sample complexity from 25,600 to a few hundred. General-purpose models (o3-mini, o4-mini) jump from 3-7% to over 40% accuracy. Our results demonstrate that targeted, compiler-guided repair of LLM outputs yields dramatic gains in both efficiency and correctness, suggesting a general paradigm for scalable automated theorem proving.

<div> Keywords: process traces, interpretation problem, Abstract Argumentation Framework, sequencetagging model, neuro-symbolic approach

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach for monitoring and analyzing process traces in companies and organizations. It addresses the interpretation problem that arises when there is a gap between trace events and reference business activities. This approach uses an Abstract Argumentation Framework to analyze event interpretations and offer explanations for conflicting results. To optimize the process, a sequencetagging model is proposed to suggest probable event interpretations in a context-aware manner. However, training this model with manually annotated traces can be costly and environmentally unsustainable. To mitigate these challenges, a data/computation-efficient neuro-symbolic approach is suggested, combining the sequence tagger with the AAF-based reasoner to refine candidate interpretations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging prior knowledge to compensate for limited example data, making this approach valuable in scenarios with cost and optimization constraints. 

Summary: 
<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.05880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring and analyzing process traces is a critical task for modern companies and organizations. In scenarios where there is a gap between trace events and reference business activities, this entails an interpretation problem, amounting to translating each event of any ongoing trace into the corresponding step of the activity instance. Building on a recent approach that frames the interpretation problem as an acceptance problem within an Abstract Argumentation Framework (AAF), one can elegantly analyze plausible event interpretations (possibly in an aggregated form), as well as offer explanations for those that conflict with prior process knowledge. Since, in settings where event-to-activity mapping is highly uncertain (or simply under-specified) this reasoning-based approach may yield lowly-informative results and heavy computation, one can think of discovering a sequencetagging model, trained to suggest highly-probable candidate event interpretations in a context-aware way. However, training such a model optimally may require using a large amount of manually-annotated example traces. Considering the urgent need of developing Green AI solutions enabling environmental and societal sustainability (with reduced labor/computational costs and carbon footprint), we propose a data/computation-efficient neuro-symbolic approach to the problem, where the candidate interpretations returned by the example-driven sequence tagger is refined by the AAF-based reasoner. This allows us to also leverage prior knowledge to compensate for the scarcity of example data, as confirmed by experimental results; clearly, this property is particularly useful in settings where data annotation and model optimization costs are subject to stringent constraints.

Summary:<br />
- Configurable systems often use feature models to specify dependencies between reusable assets.<br />
- Current feature models may contain complex constructs like cardinality constraints, making automated reasoning challenging.<br />
- This work introduces a pseudo-Boolean encoding for feature models, allowing for smaller representations of expressive constructs.<br />

- Empirical evaluations show significant performance improvements over CNF inputs for expressive constructs, with faster translation to pseudo-Boolean.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.05976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Configurable systems typically consist of reusable assets that have dependencies between each other. To specify such dependencies, feature models are commonly used. As feature models in practice are often complex, automated reasoning is typically employed to analyze the dependencies. Here, the de facto standard is translating the feature model to conjunctive normal form (CNF) to enable employing off-the-shelf tools, such as SAT or #SAT solvers. However, modern feature-modeling dialects often contain constructs, such as cardinality constraints, that are ill-suited for conversion to CNF. This mismatch between the input of reasoning engines and the available feature-modeling dialects limits the applicability of the more expressive constructs. In this work, we shorten this gap between expressive constructs and scalable automated reasoning. Our contribution is twofold: First, we provide a pseudo-Boolean encoding for feature models, which facilitates smaller representations of commonly employed constructs compared to Boolean encoding. Second, we propose a novel method to compile pseudo-Boolean formulas to Boolean d-DNNF. With the compiled d-DNNFs, we can resort to a plethora of efficient analyses already used in feature modeling. Our empirical evaluation shows that our proposal substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art based on CNF inputs for expressive constructs. For every considered dataset representing different feature models and feature-modeling constructs, the feature models can be significantly faster translated to pseudo-Boolean than to CNF. Overall, deriving d-DNNFs from a feature model with the targeted expressive constraints can be substantially accelerated using our pseudo-Boolean approach. Furthermore, our approach is competitive on feature models with only basic constructs.

ArtRAG is a novel framework for explaining visual art that combines structured knowledge and retrieval-augmented generation. It automatically constructs an Art Context Knowledge Graph from domain-specific textual sources, organizing entities like artists and historical events. At inference, a retriever selects relevant subgraphs to guide generation, enabling models to produce culturally informed descriptions. Experiments on SemArt and Artpedia datasets show ArtRAG outperforms baselines, with human evaluations confirming its ability to generate coherent and culturally enriched interpretations.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Understanding visual art requires reasoning across multiple perspectives -- cultural, historical, and stylistic -- beyond mere object recognition. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on general image captioning, they often fail to capture the nuanced interpretations that fine art demands. We propose ArtRAG, a novel, training-free framework that combines structured knowledge with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multi-perspective artwork explanation. ArtRAG automatically constructs an Art Context Knowledge Graph (ACKG) from domain-specific textual sources, organizing entities such as artists, movements, themes, and historical events into a rich, interpretable graph. At inference time, a multi-granular structured retriever selects semantically and topologically relevant subgraphs to guide generation. This enables MLLMs to produce contextually grounded, culturally informed art descriptions. Experiments on the SemArt and Artpedia datasets show that ArtRAG outperforms several heavily trained baselines. Human evaluations further confirm that ArtRAG generates coherent, insightful, and culturally enriched interpretations.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Combining natural language and geometric shapes is an emerging research area with multiple applications in robotics and language-assisted design. A crucial task in this domain is object referent identification, which involves selecting a 3D object given a textual description of the target. Variability in language descriptions and spatial relationships of 3D objects makes this a complex task, increasing the need to better understand the behavior of neural network models in this domain. However, limited research has been conducted in this area. Specifically, when a model makes an incorrect prediction despite being provided with a seemingly correct object description, practitioners are left wondering: "Why is the model wrong?". In this work, we present a method answering this question by generating counterfactual examples. Our method takes a misclassified sample, which includes two objects and a text description, and generates an alternative yet similar formulation that would have resulted in a correct prediction by the model. We have evaluated our approach with data from the ShapeTalk dataset along with three distinct models. Our counterfactual examples maintain the structure of the original description, are semantically similar and meaningful. They reveal weaknesses in the description, model bias and enhance the understanding of the models behavior. Theses insights help practitioners to better interact with systems as well as engineers to improve models.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: event sequences, data mining, conditional dependencies, sequential patterns, Minimum Description Length

Summary: 
The paper introduces a method for discovering both conditional and unconditional dependencies in event sequences. By focusing on rules of the form $X \rightarrow Y$, where X and Y are sequential patterns, the method aims to provide a clear understanding of the relationships between different events. The approach is formalized based on the Minimum Description Length principle to discover concise and non-redundant sets of rules. The Seqret method is proposed to efficiently search for high-quality rule sets in a vast and unstructured search space. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Seqret outperforms existing methods by accurately recovering ground truth on synthetic datasets and identifying meaningful rules from real datasets. This method addresses the limitations of current approaches by considering both conditional and unconditional dependencies in event sequences for more effective data mining. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Summarizing event sequences is a key aspect of data mining. Most existing methods neglect conditional dependencies and focus on discovering sequential patterns only. In this paper, we study the problem of discovering both conditional and unconditional dependencies from event sequence data. We do so by discovering rules of the form $X \rightarrow Y$ where $X$ and $Y$ are sequential patterns. Rules like these are simple to understand and provide a clear description of the relation between the antecedent and the consequent. To discover succinct and non-redundant sets of rules we formalize the problem in terms of the Minimum Description Length principle. As the search space is enormous and does not exhibit helpful structure, we propose the Seqret method to discover high-quality rule sets in practice. Through extensive empirical evaluation we show that unlike the state of the art, Seqret ably recovers the ground truth on synthetic datasets and finds useful rules from real datasets.

Summary:  
The paper addresses limitations in Large Language Models (LLMs) for hardware design tasks like generating Verilog codes, which can lead to potential copyright violations. To mitigate this risk, the authors propose an evaluation benchmark for estimating copyright protection in Verilog-trained LLMs. They introduce FreeSet, an open-source Verilog dataset, and an automated curation framework for fair-use Verilog data. Through continual pre-training, they develop FreeV, a fine-tuned LLM model for Verilog, with a low 3% violation rate for copyright infringement. Experimental results show that FreeV outperforms baseline models, improving Verilog generation functionality with a over 10% increase in VerilogEval pass@10 rates.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.06096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limitations in Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities for hardware design tasks, such as generating functional Verilog codes, have motivated various fine-tuning optimizations utilizing curated hardware datasets from open-source repositories. However, these datasets remain limited in size and contain minimal checks on licensing for reuse, resulting in potential copyright violations by fine-tuned LLMs. Therefore, we propose an evaluation benchmark to estimate the risk of Verilog-trained LLMs to generate copyright-protected codes. To minimize this risk, we present an open-source Verilog dataset, FreeSet, containing over 220k files, along with the automated dataset curation framework utilized to provide additional guarantees of fair-use Verilog data. We then execute an LLM fine-tuning framework consisting of continual pre-training, resulting in a fine-tuned Llama model for Verilog, FreeV. Our results indicate that FreeV demonstrates the smallest risk of copyright-infringement among prior works, with only a 3% violation rate. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate improvements in Verilog generation functionality over its baseline model, improving VerilogEval pass@10 rates by over 10%.

<div> latent action labels, imitation learning, continuous control tasks, unlabeled observation data, robot policies

Summary:
Continuous latent action models (CLAM) are proposed for learning robot policies using imitation learning without the need for costly action-labeled expert demonstrations. By utilizing unlabeled observation data, CLAM incorporates continuous latent action labels and trains an action decoder to ground the latent action space to real actions with few labeled examples. CLAM outperforms existing methods on complex continuous control tasks in DMControl and MetaWorld benchmarks, achieving significant improvements in task success rates. The approach is demonstrated on a real WidowX robot arm, showing a 2-3x enhancement compared to state-of-the-art methods. The ability to learn performant policies without access to labeled expert data showcases the effectiveness of CLAM in addressing the bottleneck of data collection in robot learning. Videos and code for CLAM implementation can be accessed at clamrobot.github.io. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Learning robot policies using imitation learning requires collecting large amounts of costly action-labeled expert demonstrations, which fundamentally limits the scale of training data. A promising approach to address this bottleneck is to harness the abundance of unlabeled observations-e.g., from video demonstrations-to learn latent action labels in an unsupervised way. However, we find that existing methods struggle when applied to complex robot tasks requiring fine-grained motions. We design continuous latent action models (CLAM) which incorporate two key ingredients we find necessary for learning to solve complex continuous control tasks from unlabeled observation data: (a) using continuous latent action labels instead of discrete representations, and (b) jointly training an action decoder to ensure that the latent action space can be easily grounded to real actions with relatively few labeled examples. Importantly, the labeled examples can be collected from non-optimal play data, enabling CLAM to learn performant policies without access to any action-labeled expert data. We demonstrate on continuous control benchmarks in DMControl (locomotion) and MetaWorld (manipulation), as well as on a real WidowX robot arm that CLAM significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, remarkably with a 2-3x improvement in task success rate compared to the best baseline.

Summary: This paper explores the relationship between structure and quality in the context of the hard problem of consciousness. Instead of focusing on distinctions between physical and mental aspects, the paper delves into how structure and quality are mutually determinable. It introduces an information-theoretic approach to quantify this relationship, creating a Q-S space to analyze fidelity between the two domains. The paper categorizes different relationships between structural and qualitative properties, offering insights into debates around functionalism, emergentism, idealism, panpsychism, and neutral monism. The ontological implications of these categories are examined, paving the way for a framework to derive theoretical constraints on qualitative systems undergoing evolution, as discussed in the companion paper, Qualia & Natural Selection. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper explores the hard problem of consciousness from a different perspective. Instead of drawing distinctions between the physical and the mental, an exploration of a more foundational relationship is examined: the relationship between structure and quality.
  Information-theoretic measures are developed to quantify the mutual determinability between structure and quality, including a novel Q-S space for analyzing fidelity between the two domains. This novel space naturally points toward a five-fold categorization of possible relationships between structural and qualitative properties, illustrating each through conceptual and formal models.
  The ontological implications of each category are examined, shedding light on debates around functionalism, emergentism, idealism, panpsychism, and neutral monism.
  This new line of inquiry has established a framework for deriving theoretical constraints on qualitative systems undergoing evolution that is explored in my companion paper, Qualia & Natural Selection.

Summary: 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) practitioners are shifting towards sharing pretrained models to improve business efficiency and reduce costs. Federated learning, an approach used in this process, involves aggregating pretrained models into a global model with better generalization capabilities. However, challenges arise due to the diverse device profiles in communication systems. The study introduces a metaheuristic algorithm called FedAvgen, which treats pretrained models' weight spaces as metadata, akin to genotype and phenotype in genetic evolution. This approach aims to improve the global averaging step in federated learning. The results of FedAvgen are compared to widely adopted baseline algorithms like Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Federated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FedSGD). The study highlights the potential of incorporating genetic evolution concepts into federated learning algorithms to address the challenges posed by diverse device profiles in communication systems.

Abstract: To improve business efficiency and minimize costs, Artificial Intelligence (AI) practitioners have adopted a shift from formulating models from scratch towards sharing pretrained models. The pretrained models are then aggregated into a global model with higher generalization capabilities, which is afterwards distributed to the client devices. This approach is known as federated learning and inherently utilizes different techniques to select the candidate client models averaged to obtain the global model. This approach, in the case of communication systems, faces challenges arising from the existential diversity in device profiles. The multiplicity in profiles motivates our conceptual assessment of a metaheuristic algorithm (FedAvgen), which relates each pretrained model with its weight space as metadata, to a phenotype and genotype, respectively. This parent-child genetic evolution characterizes the global averaging step in federated learning. We then compare the results of our approach to two widely adopted baseline federated learning algorithms like Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Federated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FedSGD).

Summary:
The Detection of small objects, particularly traffic signs, poses challenges in feature extraction and handling objects of varying sizes. To address these issues, a novel object detection network, Mamba-based Dynamic Dual Fusion Network (MDDFNet), is proposed. The MDDFNet integrates a dynamic dual fusion module and a Mamba-based backbone to enhance feature diversity and effectively handle objects of different scales. The dynamic dual fusion module utilizes multiple branches to consolidate spatial and semantic information, improving feature extraction. The Mamba-based backbone combines global feature fusion and local feature interaction adaptively, generating unique classification characteristics for improved detection accuracy. Experimental results on the TT100K dataset demonstrate that MDDFNet outperforms existing detectors in detecting small traffic signs while maintaining real-time processing capabilities, showcasing its effectiveness in traffic sign detection. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.05491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Detection of small objects, especially traffic signs, is a critical sub-task in object detection and autonomous driving. Despite signficant progress in previous research, two main challenges remain. First, the issue of feature extraction being too singular. Second, the detection process struggles to efectively handle objects of varying sizes or scales. These problems are also prevalent in general object detection tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel object detection network, Mamba-based Dynamic Dual Fusion Network (MDDFNet), for traffic sign detection. The network integrates a dynamic dual fusion module and a Mamba-based backbone to simultaneously tackle the aforementioned issues. Specifically, the dynamic dual fusion module utilizes multiple branches to consolidate various spatial and semantic information, thus enhancing feature diversity. The Mamba-based backbone leverages global feature fusion and local feature interaction, combining features in an adaptive manner to generate unique classification characteristics. Extensive experiments conducted on the TT100K (Tsinghua-Tencent 100K) datasets demonstrate that MDDFNet outperforms other state-of-the-art detectors, maintaining real-time processing capabilities of single-stage models while achieving superior performance. This confirms the efectiveness of MDDFNet in detecting small traffic signs.

Abstract: The European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) requires companies to prove their products do not contribute to deforestation, creating a critical demand for precise, asset-level environmental impact data. Current databases lack the necessary detail, relying heavily on broad financial metrics and manual data collection, which limits regulatory compliance and accurate environmental modeling. This study presents an automated, end-to-end data extraction pipeline that uses LLMs to create, clean, and validate structured databases, specifically targeting sectors with a high risk of deforestation. The pipeline introduces Instructional, Role-Based, Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (IRZ-CoT) prompting to enhance data extraction accuracy and a Retrieval-Augmented Validation (RAV) process that integrates real-time web searches for improved data reliability. Applied to SEC EDGAR filings in the Mining, Oil & Gas, and Utilities sectors, the pipeline demonstrates significant improvements over traditional zero-shot prompting approaches, particularly in extraction accuracy and validation coverage. This work advances NLP-driven automation for regulatory compliance, CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility), and ESG, with broad sectoral applicability.

Summary:
GPT-4o(mni) by OpenAI demonstrates remarkable visual generation capabilities, excelling in multimodal comprehension across various tasks. A task taxonomy was constructed to evaluate the model's performance in six categories, showcasing strengths in text-to-image generation and visual stylization. However, limitations were observed in spatial reasoning, instruction-grounded generation, and temporal prediction. In knowledge-intensive or domain-specific scenarios, such as scientific illustrations, the model exhibited errors and inconsistencies. While GPT-4o represents a significant advancement in unified multimodal generation, challenges remain in applying it reliably in professional or safety-critical domains. <div>

Abstract: Recently, the visual generation ability by GPT-4o(mni) has been unlocked by OpenAI. It demonstrates a very remarkable generation capability with excellent multimodal condition understanding and varied task instructions. In this paper, we aim to explore the capabilities of GPT-4o across various tasks. Inspired by previous study, we constructed a task taxonomy along with a carefully curated set of test samples to conduct a comprehensive qualitative test. Benefiting from GPT-4o's powerful multimodal comprehension, its image-generation process demonstrates abilities surpassing those of traditional image-generation tasks. Thus, regarding the dimensions of model capabilities, we evaluate its performance across six task categories: traditional image generation tasks, discriminative tasks, knowledge-based generation, commonsense-based generation, spatially-aware image generation, and temporally-aware image generation. These tasks not only assess the quality and conditional alignment of the model's outputs but also probe deeper into GPT-4o's understanding of real-world concepts. Our results reveal that GPT-4o performs impressively well in general-purpose synthesis tasks, showing strong capabilities in text-to-image generation, visual stylization, and low-level image processing. However, significant limitations remain in its ability to perform precise spatial reasoning, instruction-grounded generation, and consistent temporal prediction. Furthermore, when faced with knowledge-intensive or domain-specific scenarios, such as scientific illustrations or mathematical plots, the model often exhibits hallucinations, factual errors, or structural inconsistencies. These findings suggest that while GPT-4o marks a substantial advancement in unified multimodal generation, there is still a long way to go before it can be reliably applied to professional or safety-critical domains.

Abstract: Gliomas are aggressive brain tumors that pose serious health risks. Deep learning aids in lesion segmentation, but CNN and Transformer-based models often lack context modeling or demand heavy computation, limiting real-time use on mobile medical devices. We propose GaMNet, integrating the NMamba module for global modeling and a multi-scale CNN for efficient local feature extraction. To improve interpretability and mimic the human visual system, we apply Gabor filters at multiple scales. Our method achieves high segmentation accuracy with fewer parameters and faster computation. Extensive experiments show GaMNet outperforms existing methods, notably reducing false positives and negatives, which enhances the reliability of clinical diagnosis.

Abstract: Biological brains demonstrate complex neural activity, where the timing and interplay between neurons is critical to how brains process information. Most deep learning architectures simplify neural activity by abstracting away temporal dynamics. In this paper we challenge that paradigm. By incorporating neuron-level processing and synchronization, we can effectively reintroduce neural timing as a foundational element. We present the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM), a model designed to leverage neural dynamics as its core representation. The CTM has two core innovations: (1) neuron-level temporal processing, where each neuron uses unique weight parameters to process a history of incoming signals; and (2) neural synchronization employed as a latent representation. The CTM aims to strike a balance between oversimplified neuron abstractions that improve computational efficiency, and biological realism. It operates at a level of abstraction that effectively captures essential temporal dynamics while remaining computationally tractable for deep learning. We demonstrate the CTM's strong performance and versatility across a range of challenging tasks, including ImageNet-1K classification, solving 2D mazes, sorting, parity computation, question-answering, and RL tasks. Beyond displaying rich internal representations and offering a natural avenue for interpretation owing to its internal process, the CTM is able to perform tasks that require complex sequential reasoning. The CTM can also leverage adaptive compute, where it can stop earlier for simpler tasks, or keep computing when faced with more challenging instances. The goal of this work is to share the CTM and its associated innovations, rather than pushing for new state-of-the-art results. To that end, we believe the CTM represents a significant step toward developing more biologically plausible and powerful artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are recognized to have significant effects on industry and business dynamics, not least because of their impact on the preconditions for entrepreneurship. There is still a lack of knowledge of GenAI as a theme in entrepreneurship research. This paper presents a systematic literature review aimed at identifying and analyzing the evolving landscape of research on the effects of GenAI on entrepreneurship. We analyze 83 peer-reviewed articles obtained from leading academic databases: Web of Science and Scopus. Using natural language processing and unsupervised machine learning techniques with TF-IDF vectorization, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and hierarchical clustering, five major thematic clusters are identified: (1) Digital Transformation and Behavioral Models, (2) GenAI-Enhanced Education and Learning Systems, (3) Sustainable Innovation and Strategic AI Impact, (4) Business Models and Market Trends, and (5) Data-Driven Technological Trends in Entrepreneurship. Based on the review, we discuss future research directions, gaps in the current literature, as well as ethical concerns raised in the literature. We highlight the need for more macro-level research on GenAI and LLMs as external enablers for entrepreneurship and for research on effective regulatory frameworks that facilitate business experimentation, innovation, and further technology development.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a novel training method for spiking neural networks (SNNs) using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). SNNs are appealing for time-series processing due to their low energy consumption, but existing training algorithms have limitations. The popular backpropagation method faces scalability and numerical precision issues in SNNs. The proposed ADMM-based approach addresses the non-differentiability of the SNN step function, offering closed-form updates and demonstrating promising convergence properties through simulation. The method shows potential for improving SNN training efficiency and opens avenues for further research in this area. <br /> 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained momentum due to their high potential in time-series processing combined with minimal energy consumption. However, they still lack a dedicated and efficient training algorithm. The popular backpropagation with surrogate gradients, adapted from stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-derived algorithms, has several drawbacks when used as an optimizer for SNNs. Specifically, it suffers from low scalability and numerical imprecision. In this paper, we propose a novel SNN training method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our ADMM-based training aims to solve the problem of the SNN step function's non-differentiability. We formulate the problem, derive closed-form updates, and empirically show the optimizer's convergence properties, great potential, and possible new research directions to improve the method in a simulated proof-of-concept.

Summary:<br />
This work introduces X-Transfer, a novel attack method that exploits a universal adversarial vulnerability in CLIP models. X-Transfer generates a Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) that can deceive various CLIP encoders and downstream vision-language models (VLMs) across different samples, tasks, and domains. This is achieved through surrogate scaling, a key innovation that dynamically selects suitable surrogates for scaling efficiently. X-Transfer outperforms previous UAP methods by establishing a benchmark for adversarial transferability across CLIP models. The code for X-Transfer is publicly available on GitHub. <div>
arXiv:2505.05528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models are increasingly adopted for diverse downstream tasks and integrated into large vision-language models (VLMs), their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations has emerged as a critical concern. In this work, we introduce \textbf{X-Transfer}, a novel attack method that exposes a universal adversarial vulnerability in CLIP. X-Transfer generates a Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) capable of deceiving various CLIP encoders and downstream VLMs across different samples, tasks, and domains. We refer to this property as \textbf{super transferability}--a single perturbation achieving cross-data, cross-domain, cross-model, and cross-task adversarial transferability simultaneously. This is achieved through \textbf{surrogate scaling}, a key innovation of our approach. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed surrogate models, which are computationally intensive to scale, X-Transfer employs an efficient surrogate scaling strategy that dynamically selects a small subset of suitable surrogates from a large search space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that X-Transfer significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art UAP methods, establishing a new benchmark for adversarial transferability across CLIP models. The code is publicly available in our \href{https://github.com/HanxunH/XTransferBench}{GitHub repository}.

Summary: 
Model quantization is an essential technique for reducing the computation costs and model sizes of deep neural networks (DNNs) to make them suitable for real-world deployment. This article provides a comprehensive survey of the advancements in low-bit quantization methods for DNNs over the past five years. The conversion from continuous floating-point numbers to discrete integers accelerates memory I/O and calculations but can lead to a loss of precision and subsequent performance degradation. Different quantization methods are classified into 8 main categories and 24 sub-categories based on their core techniques. The article highlights the importance of investigating how to perform the conversion and how to compensate for the information loss. The curated list of model quantization techniques provided offers valuable resources for further research in this field.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: With unprecedented rapid development, deep neural networks (DNNs) have deeply influenced almost all fields. However, their heavy computation costs and model sizes are usually unacceptable in real-world deployment. Model quantization, an effective weight-lighting technique, has become an indispensable procedure in the whole deployment pipeline. The essence of quantization acceleration is the conversion from continuous floating-point numbers to discrete integer ones, which significantly speeds up the memory I/O and calculation, i.e., addition and multiplication. However, performance degradation also comes with the conversion because of the loss of precision. Therefore, it has become increasingly popular and critical to investigate how to perform the conversion and how to compensate for the information loss. This article surveys the recent five-year progress towards low-bit quantization on DNNs. We discuss and compare the state-of-the-art quantization methods and classify them into 8 main categories and 24 sub-categories according to their core techniques. Furthermore, we shed light on the potential research opportunities in the field of model quantization.

<div> Keywords: Graph contrastive learning, structural distance, label consistency, random walk theory, RELGCL

Summary: 
- Graph contrastive learning faces challenges in preserving absolute similarity due to the discrete and non-Euclidean nature of graphs.
- Label consistency diminishes systematically as structural distance increases, showing smooth decay in homophily graphs and oscillatory decay in heterophily graphs.
- Theoretical guarantees for this pattern are established through random walk theory, demonstrating label distribution convergence.
- Graphs encode relative similarity patterns where structurally closer nodes have stronger semantic relationships.
- RELGCL, a novel GCL framework, leverages natural relative similarity through collective similarity objectives and outperforms existing approaches in both homophily and heterophily graphs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.05533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has achieved remarkable success by following the computer vision paradigm of preserving absolute similarity between augmented views. However, this approach faces fundamental challenges in graphs due to their discrete, non-Euclidean nature -- view generation often breaks semantic validity and similarity verification becomes unreliable. Through analyzing 11 real-world graphs, we discover a universal pattern transcending the homophily-heterophily dichotomy: label consistency systematically diminishes as structural distance increases, manifesting as smooth decay in homophily graphs and oscillatory decay in heterophily graphs. We establish theoretical guarantees for this pattern through random walk theory, proving label distribution convergence and characterizing the mechanisms behind different decay behaviors. This discovery reveals that graphs naturally encode relative similarity patterns, where structurally closer nodes exhibit collectively stronger semantic relationships. Leveraging this insight, we propose RELGCL, a novel GCL framework with complementary pairwise and listwise implementations that preserve these inherent patterns through collective similarity objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms 20 existing approaches across both homophily and heterophily graphs, validating the effectiveness of leveraging natural relative similarity over artificial absolute similarity.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) classification is crucial for automated cardiac disease diagnosis, yet existing methods often struggle to capture local morphological details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose Cardioformer, a novel multi-granularity hybrid model that integrates cross-channel patching, hierarchical residual learning, and a two-stage self-attention mechanism. Cardioformer first encodes multi-scale token embeddings to capture fine-grained local features and global contextual information and then selectively fuses these representations through intra- and inter-granularity self-attention. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark ECG datasets under subject-independent settings demonstrate that model consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines. Our Cardioformer model achieves the AUROC of 96.34$\pm$0.11, 89.99$\pm$0.12, and 95.59$\pm$1.66 in MIMIC-IV, PTB-XL and PTB dataset respectively outperforming PatchTST, Reformer, Transformer, and Medformer models. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, achieving 49.18% AUROC on PTB and 68.41% on PTB-XL when trained on MIMIC-IV. These findings underscore the potential of Cardioformer to advance automated ECG analysis, paving the way for more accurate and robust cardiovascular disease diagnosis. We release the source code at https://github.com/KMobin555/Cardioformer.

Summary: 
The review focuses on the relationship between the Uncanny Valley Effect (UVE) and trust in artificial agents. It identifies 53 empirical studies and analyzes them based on categories such as types of agents, interactions, and measurement approaches. Most studies use static images or hypothetical scenarios with subjective trust measures, indicating a lack of real-time interaction data. The review proposes a framework for classifying trust measurement approaches to improve empirical investigations of the UVE. By mapping the intersection of the UVE and trust, the review offers insights into their interplay and sets a foundation for future research. <div>

Abstract: Trust is a fundamental component of human-agent interaction. With the increasing presence of artificial agents in daily life, it is essential to understand how people perceive and trust these agents. One of the key challenges affecting this perception is the Uncanny Valley Effect (UVE), where increasingly human-like artificial beings can be perceived as eerie or repelling. Despite growing interest in trust and the UVE, existing research varies widely in terms of how these concepts are defined and operationalized. This inconsistency raises important questions about how and under what conditions the UVE influences trust in agents. A systematic understanding of their relationship is currently lacking. This review aims to examine the impact of the UVE on human trust in agents and to identify methodological patterns, limitations, and gaps in the existing empirical literature. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search identified 53 empirical studies that investigated both UVE-related constructs and trust or trust-related outcomes. Studies were analyzed based on a structured set of categories, including types of agents and interactions, methodological and measurement approaches, and key findings. The results of our systematic review reveal that most studies rely on static images or hypothetical scenarios with limited real-time interaction, and the majority use subjective trust measures. This review offers a novel framework for classifying trust measurement approaches with regard to the best-practice criteria for empirically investigating the UVE. As the first systematic attempt to map the intersection of UVE and trust, this review contributes to a deeper understanding of their interplay and offers a foundation for future research.

Abstract: The generation of realistic medical images from text descriptions has significant potential to address data scarcity challenges in healthcare AI while preserving patient privacy. This paper presents a comprehensive study of text-to-image synthesis in the medical domain, comparing two distinct approaches: (1) fine-tuning large pre-trained latent diffusion models and (2) training small, domain-specific models. We introduce a novel model named MSDM, an optimized architecture based on Stable Diffusion that integrates a clinical text encoder, variational autoencoder, and cross-attention mechanisms to better align medical text prompts with generated images. Our study compares two approaches: fine-tuning large pre-trained models (FLUX, Kandinsky) versus training compact domain-specific models (MSDM). Evaluation across colonoscopy (MedVQA-GI) and radiology (ROCOv2) datasets reveals that while large models achieve higher fidelity, our optimized MSDM delivers comparable quality with lower computational costs. Quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations by medical experts reveal strengths and limitations of each approach.

Abstract: Existing biomedical benchmarks do not provide end-to-end infrastructure for training, evaluation, and inference of models that integrate multimodal biological data and a broad range of machine learning tasks in therapeutics. We present PyTDC, an open-source machine-learning platform providing streamlined training, evaluation, and inference software for multimodal biological AI models. PyTDC unifies distributed, heterogeneous, continuously updated data sources and model weights and standardizes benchmarking and inference endpoints. This paper discusses the components of PyTDC's architecture and, to our knowledge, the first-of-its-kind case study on the introduced single-cell drug-target nomination ML task. We find state-of-the-art methods in graph representation learning and domain-specific methods from graph theory perform poorly on this task. Though we find a context-aware geometric deep learning method that outperforms the evaluated SoTA and domain-specific baseline methods, the model is unable to generalize to unseen cell types or incorporate additional modalities, highlighting PyTDC's capacity to facilitate an exciting avenue of research developing multimodal, context-aware, foundation models for open problems in biomedical AI.

Summary:
ReactDance introduces a novel diffusion-based framework for reactive dance generation, emphasizing high-fidelity movements with long-term coherence and multi-scale controllability. The approach addresses shortcomings of existing methods by utilizing Group Residual Finite Scalar Quantization (GRFSQ) to capture interaction semantics at various scales and Blockwise Local Context (BLC) to improve sampling accuracy and eliminate error accumulation in long sequence generation. These innovations enable granular control over motion semantics and enhance synchronization and temporal consistency in duet synthesis. By implementing a diffusion model with Layer-Decoupled Classifier-free Guidance (LDCFG), ReactDance achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating follower movements conditioned on guiding dancers and music while ensuring spatial coordination and temporal coherence. <div>

Abstract: Reactive dance generation (RDG) produces follower movements conditioned on guiding dancer and music while ensuring spatial coordination and temporal coherence. However, existing methods overemphasize global constraints and optimization, overlooking local information, such as fine-grained spatial interactions and localized temporal context. Therefore, we present ReactDance, a novel diffusion-based framework for high-fidelity RDG with long-term coherence and multi-scale controllability. Unlike existing methods that struggle with interaction fidelity, synchronization, and temporal consistency in duet synthesis, our approach introduces two key innovations: 1)Group Residual Finite Scalar Quantization (GRFSQ), a multi-scale disentangled motion representation that captures interaction semantics from coarse body rhythms to fine-grained joint dynamics, and 2)Blockwise Local Context (BLC), a sampling strategy eliminating error accumulation in long sequence generation via local block causal masking and periodic positional encoding. Built on the decoupled multi-scale GRFSQ representation, we implement a diffusion model withLayer-Decoupled Classifier-free Guidance (LDCFG), allowing granular control over motion semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ReactDance surpasses existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Summary:
The research focuses on improving object localization in satellite imagery, specifically for Gravity Waves, Mesospheric Bores, and Ocean Eddies datasets. The challenges include variability in object patterns and features. A novel approach, YOLO-DCAP, enhances the YOLOv5 model with Multi-scale Dilated Residual Convolution and Attention-aided Spatial Pooling modules. Experimental results show significant performance improvements over the base model and state-of-the-art methods, with an average increase of 20.95% in mAP50 and 32.23% in IoU compared to the base model, and 7.35% and 9.84% over existing alternatives. The proposed approach demonstrates robustness and generalizability across all three datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/AI-4-atmosphere-remote-sensing/satellite-object-localization. <div>

Abstract: Object localization in satellite imagery is particularly challenging due to the high variability of objects, low spatial resolution, and interference from noise and dominant features such as clouds and city lights. In this research, we focus on three satellite datasets: upper atmospheric Gravity Waves (GW), mesospheric Bores (Bore), and Ocean Eddies (OE), each presenting its own unique challenges. These challenges include the variability in the scale and appearance of the main object patterns, where the size, shape, and feature extent of objects of interest can differ significantly. To address these challenges, we introduce YOLO-DCAP, a novel enhanced version of YOLOv5 designed to improve object localization in these complex scenarios. YOLO-DCAP incorporates a Multi-scale Dilated Residual Convolution (MDRC) block to capture multi-scale features at scale with varying dilation rates, and an Attention-aided Spatial Pooling (AaSP) module to focus on the global relevant spatial regions, enhancing feature selection. These structural improvements help to better localize objects in satellite imagery. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-DCAP significantly outperforms both the YOLO base model and state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average improvement of 20.95% in mAP50 and 32.23% in IoU over the base model, and 7.35% and 9.84% respectively over state-of-the-art alternatives, consistently across all three satellite datasets. These consistent gains across all three satellite datasets highlight the robustness and generalizability of the proposed approach.

<div> Keywords: Aerial vision-and-language navigation, urban environments, language model, hierarchical semantic planning, global memory module

Summary: 
CityNavAgent is a new approach for aerial vision-and-language navigation in urban environments. It utilizes a large language model (LLM) to simplify the navigation process by breaking down the task into sub-goals with different semantic levels. A hierarchical semantic planning module (HSPM) is used to achieve these sub-goals progressively. Additionally, a global memory module stores historical trajectories in a topological graph to assist in navigation to previously visited targets. Extensive benchmark experiments show that CityNavAgent outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The effectiveness of the different modules in CityNavAgent is demonstrated through experiments in continuous city environments. The code for CityNavAgent is publicly available on GitHub for further research and development.

Abstract: Aerial vision-and-language navigation (VLN), requiring drones to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex urban environments, emerges as a critical embodied AI challenge that bridges human-robot interaction, 3D spatial reasoning, and real-world deployment. Although existing ground VLN agents achieved notable results in indoor and outdoor settings, they struggle in aerial VLN due to the absence of predefined navigation graphs and the exponentially expanding action space in long-horizon exploration. In this work, we propose \textbf{CityNavAgent}, a large language model (LLM)-empowered agent that significantly reduces the navigation complexity for urban aerial VLN. Specifically, we design a hierarchical semantic planning module (HSPM) that decomposes the long-horizon task into sub-goals with different semantic levels. The agent reaches the target progressively by achieving sub-goals with different capacities of the LLM. Additionally, a global memory module storing historical trajectories into a topological graph is developed to simplify navigation for visited targets. Extensive benchmark experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvement. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of different modules of CityNavAgent for aerial VLN in continuous city environments.

Summary: The article introduces a Stiff Physics-Informed Neural ODE framework (SPIN-ODE) for estimating rate constants in complex chemical reactions. The framework utilizes a three-stage optimization process: first, a latent neural ODE to learn the trajectory between chemical concentrations and their derivatives; second, a Chemical Reaction Neural Network (CRNN) to extract rate coefficients based on the learned dynamics; and finally, fine-tuning of CRNN using a neural ODE solver.

Abstract: Estimating rate constants from complex chemical reactions is essential for advancing detailed chemistry. However, the stiffness inherent in real-world atmospheric chemistry systems poses severe challenges, leading to training instability and poor convergence that hinder effective rate constant estimation using learning-based approaches. To address this, we propose a Stiff Physics-Informed Neural ODE framework (SPIN-ODE) for chemical reaction modelling. Our method introduces a three-stage optimisation process: first, a latent neural ODE learns the continuous and differentiable trajectory between chemical concentrations and their time derivatives; second, an explicit Chemical Reaction Neural Network (CRNN) extracts the underlying rate coefficients based on the learned dynamics; and third, fine-tune CRNN using a neural ODE solver to further improve rate coefficient estimation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and newly proposed real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. As the first work on stiff Neural ODEs for chemical rate coefficient discovery, our study opens promising directions for integrating neural networks with detailed chemistry.

Summary:
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face challenges in achieving deep alignment between vision and language, often relying too heavily on language priors. This study delves into how MLLMs develop internal visual understanding of image regions and introduces techniques to enhance this capability. By deepening the model's grasp of visual content and ensuring that visual insights guide language generation, the model shows superior multimodal understanding. Upstream analysis reveals the model's improved aptitude in predicting visually-dependent tokens and a notable 10-point enhancement on visually challenging tasks. The techniques employed in this study aim to strengthen the connection between visual and linguistic information in MLLMs, leading to more effective and contextually relevant multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Achieving deep alignment between vision and language remains a central challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). These models often fail to fully leverage visual input, defaulting to strong language priors. Our approach first provides insights into how MLLMs internally build visual understanding of image regions and then introduces techniques to amplify this capability. Specifically, we explore techniques designed both to deepen the model's understanding of visual content and to ensure that these visual insights actively guide language generation. We demonstrate the superior multimodal understanding of our resultant model through a detailed upstream analysis quantifying its ability to predict visually-dependent tokens as well as 10 pt boost on visually challenging tasks.

Summary:
In the study, the interplay between advanced motion prediction models and motion planners in autonomous driving systems was evaluated. While larger models focused on improving open-loop prediction accuracy, it was found that higher accuracy does not always lead to better closed-loop driving behavior. Factors such as temporal consistency of predictions and compatibility with planners were identified as significant. Surprisingly, downsized versions of these models with up to 86% fewer parameters showed comparable or better closed-loop driving performance. These findings suggest that parameter size reduction can be beneficial in achieving efficient autonomous driving systems. The research code is available for access on the GitHub repository. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Fueled by motion prediction competitions and benchmarks, recent years have seen the emergence of increasingly large learning based prediction models, many with millions of parameters, focused on improving open-loop prediction accuracy by mere centimeters. However, these benchmarks fail to assess whether such improvements translate to better performance when integrated into an autonomous driving stack. In this work, we systematically evaluate the interplay between state-of-the-art motion predictors and motion planners. Our results show that higher open-loop accuracy does not always correlate with better closed-loop driving behavior and that other factors, such as temporal consistency of predictions and planner compatibility, also play a critical role. Furthermore, we investigate downsized variants of these models, and, surprisingly, find that in some cases models with up to 86% fewer parameters yield comparable or even superior closed-loop driving performance.

<div> detecting failures, large language models, hallucinations, safety-critical scenarios, prompt perturbations<br />
Summary:
In this study, the authors highlight the importance of detecting failures in large language models (LLMs), particularly in safety-critical situations where hallucinations can pose risks. They demonstrate through manual case studies that various forms of perturbations can cause LLMs to hallucinate in a driving environment. To efficiently search for prompt perturbations that induce uncertainty in LLMs, the authors propose a method using Adaptive Stress Testing (AST) with Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). By generating prompt perturbation trees across diverse scenarios, offline analyses can be used to generate prompts that influence model uncertainty and inform real-time trust assessments of LLMs. This approach aims to improve the safety and reliability of LLMs by identifying and mitigating potential failures before they occur. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.05665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated success in generalizing across decision-making tasks including planning, control and prediction, but their tendency to hallucinate unsafe and undesired outputs poses risks. We argue that detecting such failures is necessary, especially in safety-critical scenarios. Existing black-box methods often detect hallucinations by identifying inconsistencies across multiple samples. Many of these approaches typically introduce prompt perturbations like randomizing detail order or generating adversarial inputs, with the intuition that a confident model should produce stable outputs. We first perform a manual case study showing that other forms of perturbations (e.g., adding noise, removing sensor details) cause LLMs to hallucinate in a driving environment. We then propose a novel method for efficiently searching the space of prompt perturbations using Adaptive Stress Testing (AST) with Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Our AST formulation enables discovery of scenarios and prompts that cause language models to act with high uncertainty. By generating MCTS prompt perturbation trees across diverse scenarios, we show that offline analyses can be used at runtime to automatically generate prompts that influence model uncertainty, and to inform real-time trust assessments of an LLM.

arXiv:2505.05666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a popular technique for enhancing the reliability and utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding responses in external documents. Traditional RAG systems rely on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to first process scanned documents into text. However, even state-of-the-art OCRs can introduce errors, especially in degraded or complex documents. Recent vision-language approaches, such as ColPali, propose direct visual embedding of documents, eliminating the need for OCR. This study presents a systematic comparison between a vision-based RAG system (ColPali) and more traditional OCR-based pipelines utilizing Llama 3.2 (90B) and Nougat OCR across varying document qualities. Beyond conventional retrieval accuracy metrics, we introduce a semantic answer evaluation benchmark to assess end-to-end question-answering performance. Our findings indicate that while vision-based RAG performs well on documents it has been fine-tuned on, OCR-based RAG is better able to generalize to unseen documents of varying quality. We highlight the key trade-offs between computational efficiency and semantic accuracy, offering practical guidance for RAG practitioners in selecting between OCR-dependent and vision-based document retrieval systems in production environments.

The algorithms, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO), are assessed across various synthetic tasks and spuriousness conditions. Findings indicate that models may degrade under higher spurious correlations, with preference-based methods showing relative robustness in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Supervised and preference-based fine-tuning techniques have become popular for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user intent and correctness criteria. However, real-world training data often exhibits spurious correlations -- arising from biases, dataset artifacts, or other "shortcut" features -- that can compromise a model's performance or generalization. In this paper, we systematically evaluate three post-training algorithms -- Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and KTO (Kahneman-Tversky Optimization) -- across a diverse set of synthetic tasks and spuriousness conditions. Our tasks span mathematical reasoning, constrained instruction-following, and document-grounded question answering. We vary the degree of spurious correlation (10% vs. 90%) and investigate two forms of artifacts: "Feature Ambiguity" and "Distributional Narrowness." Our results show that the models often but not always degrade under higher spuriousness. The preference-based methods (DPO/KTO) can demonstrate relative robustness in mathematical reasoning tasks. By contrast, SFT maintains stronger performance in complex, context-intensive tasks. These findings highlight that no single post-training strategy universally outperforms in all scenarios; the best choice depends on the type of target task and the nature of spurious correlations.

The article introduces HyperspectralMAE, a Transformer-based model for hyperspectral data.

Pre-trained on NASA EO-1 Hyperion and DLR EnMAP Level-0 datasets, it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the Indian Pines benchmark for land-cover classification. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of dual masking and wavelength-aware embeddings in advancing hyperspectral image analysis and reconstruction.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.05710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectral detail but poses unique challenges because of its high dimensionality in both spatial and spectral domains. We propose \textit{HyperspectralMAE}, a Transformer-based foundation model for hyperspectral data that employs a \textit{dual masking} strategy: during pre-training we randomly occlude 50\% of spatial patches and 50\% of spectral bands. This forces the model to learn representations capable of reconstructing missing information across both dimensions. To encode spectral order, we introduce learnable harmonic Fourier positional embeddings based on wavelength. The reconstruction objective combines mean-squared error (MSE) with the spectral angle mapper (SAM) to balance pixel-level accuracy and spectral-shape fidelity.
  The resulting model contains about $1.8\times10^{8}$ parameters and produces 768-dimensional embeddings, giving it sufficient capacity for transfer learning. We pre-trained HyperspectralMAE on two large hyperspectral corpora -- NASA EO-1 Hyperion ($\sim$1\,600 scenes, $\sim$$3\times10^{11}$ pixel spectra) and DLR EnMAP Level-0 ($\sim$1\,300 scenes, $\sim$$3\times10^{11}$ pixel spectra) -- and fine-tuned it for land-cover classification on the Indian Pines benchmark. HyperspectralMAE achieves state-of-the-art transfer-learning accuracy on Indian Pines, confirming that masked dual-dimensional pre-training yields robust spectral-spatial representations. These results demonstrate that dual masking and wavelength-aware embeddings advance hyperspectral image reconstruction and downstream analysis.

Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that FOCUS not only improves accuracy but also significantly reduces computational costs.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is essential for applications such as traffic management and weather prediction, which depend on capturing long-range temporal dependencies and interactions between entities. Existing methods, particularly those based on Transformer architectures, compute pairwise dependencies across all time steps, leading to a computational complexity that scales quadratically with the length of the input. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Forecaster with Offline Clustering Using Segments (FOCUS), a novel approach to MTS forecasting that simplifies long-range dependency modeling through the use of prototypes extracted via offline clustering. These prototypes encapsulate high-level events in the real-world system underlying the data, summarizing the key characteristics of similar time segments. In the online phase, FOCUS dynamically adapts these patterns to the current input and captures dependencies between the input segment and high-level events, enabling both accurate and efficient forecasting. By identifying prototypes during the offline clustering phase, FOCUS reduces the computational complexity of modeling long-range dependencies in the online phase to linear scaling. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FOCUS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs.

Summary:
Embodiment scaling laws, which suggest that training across a wide range of physical embodiments improves generalization, were investigated in this study focusing on robot locomotion. A dataset of diverse embodiments was generated, including humanoids, quadrupeds, and hexapods, to train generalist policies. The study shows that increasing the number of training embodiments enhances generalization to unseen ones, and scaling embodiments is more effective than scaling data on fixed sets. The best policy trained on the full dataset was able to transfer to novel embodiments like Unitree Go2 and H1 in the real world without prior training. These findings contribute to the development of general embodied intelligence and have implications for adaptive control in configurable robots and the co-design of morphology and control.

Using robot locomotion as a test bed, we procedurally generate a dataset of $\sim$1,000 varied embodiments, spanning humanoids, quadrupeds, and hexapods, and train generalist policies capable of handling diverse observation and action spaces on random subsets. We find that increasing the number of training embodiments improves generalization to unseen ones, and scaling embodiments is more effective in enabling embodiment-level generalization than scaling data on small, fixed sets of embodiments. Notably, our best policy, trained on the full dataset, zero-shot transfers to novel embodiments in the real world, such as Unitree Go2 and H1.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have unveiled remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating both natural language and code, but LLM reasoning is prone to hallucination and struggle with complex, novel scenarios, often getting stuck on partial or incorrect solutions. However, the inherent ability of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to explore extensive and complex search spaces makes them particularly effective in scenarios where traditional optimization methodologies may falter. However, EAs explore a vast search space when applied to complex problems.
  To address the computational bottleneck of evaluating large populations, particularly crucial for complex evolutionary tasks, we introduce a highly efficient evaluation framework. This implementation maintains compatibility with existing primitive definitions, ensuring the generation of valid individuals.
  Using LLMs, we propose an enhanced evolutionary search strategy that enables a more focused exploration of expansive solution spaces. LLMs facilitate the generation of superior candidate solutions, as evidenced by empirical results demonstrating their efficacy in producing improved outcomes.

Abstract: Since the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), various research based on such models have maintained significant academic attention and impact, especially in AI and robotics. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework with LLMs to construct an integrated system for robotic task analysis, mechanical design, and path generation. The framework includes three core agents: Task Analyst, Robot Designer, and Reinforcement Learning Designer. Outputs are formatted as multimodal results, such as code files or technical reports, for stronger understandability and usability. To evaluate generalizability comparatively, we conducted experiments with models from both GPT and DeepSeek. Results demonstrate that the proposed system can design feasible robots with control strategies when appropriate task inputs are provided, exhibiting substantial potential for enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of robotic system development in research and industrial applications.

Abstract: Diabetic macular edema (DME) significantly contributes to visual impairment in diabetic patients. Treatment responses to intravitreal therapies vary, highlighting the need for patient stratification to predict therapeutic benefits and enable personalized strategies. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore pre-treatment stratification for predicting DME treatment responses. To advance this research, we organized the 2nd Asia-Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) Big Data Competition in 2021. The competition focused on improving predictive accuracy for anti-VEGF therapy responses using ophthalmic OCT images. We provided a dataset containing tens of thousands of OCT images from 2,000 patients with labels across four sub-tasks. This paper details the competition's structure, dataset, leading methods, and evaluation metrics. The competition attracted strong scientific community participation, with 170 teams initially registering and 41 reaching the final round. The top-performing team achieved an AUC of 80.06%, highlighting the potential of AI in personalized DME treatment and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: This paper presents PyResBugs, a curated dataset of residual bugs, i.e., defects that persist undetected during traditional testing but later surface in production, collected from major Python frameworks. Each bug in the dataset is paired with its corresponding fault-free (fixed) version and annotated with multi-level natural language (NL) descriptions. These NL descriptions enable natural language-driven fault injection, offering a novel approach to simulating real-world faults in software systems. By bridging the gap between software fault injection techniques and real-world representativeness, PyResBugs provides researchers with a high-quality resource for advancing AI-driven automated testing in Python systems.

<title>FlowHFT: Flow Policy Induced Optimal High-Frequency Trading under Diverse Market Conditions</title>

Abstract: High-frequency trading (HFT) is an investing strategy that continuously monitors market states and places bid and ask orders at millisecond speeds. Traditional HFT approaches fit models with historical data and assume that future market states follow similar patterns. This limits the effectiveness of any single model to the specific conditions it was trained for. Additionally, these models achieve optimal solutions only under specific market conditions, such as assumptions about stock price's stochastic process, stable order flow, and the absence of sudden volatility. Real-world markets, however, are dynamic, diverse, and frequently volatile. To address these challenges, we propose the FlowHFT, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow matching policy. FlowHFT simultaneously learns strategies from numerous expert models, each proficient in particular market scenarios. As a result, our framework can adaptively adjust investment decisions according to the prevailing market state. Furthermore, FlowHFT incorporates a grid-search fine-tuning mechanism. This allows it to refine strategies and achieve superior performance even in complex or extreme market scenarios where expert strategies may be suboptimal. We test FlowHFT in multiple market environments. We first show that flow matching policy is applicable in stochastic market environments, thus enabling FlowHFT to learn trading strategies under different market conditions. Notably, our single framework consistently achieves performance superior to the best expert for each market condition.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly pushing the limits of contemporary computing hardware. For example, training GPT-3 has been estimated to consume around 1300 MWh of electricity, and projections suggest future models may require city-scale (gigawatt) power budgets. These demands motivate exploration of computing paradigms beyond conventional von Neumann architectures. This review surveys emerging photonic hardware optimized for next-generation generative AI computing. We discuss integrated photonic neural network architectures (e.g., Mach-Zehnder interferometer meshes, lasers, wavelength-multiplexed microring resonators) that perform ultrafast matrix operations. We also examine promising alternative neuromorphic devices, including spiking neural network circuits and hybrid spintronic-photonic synapses, which combine memory and processing. The integration of two-dimensional materials (graphene, TMDCs) into silicon photonic platforms is reviewed for tunable modulators and on-chip synaptic elements. Transformer-based LLM architectures (self-attention and feed-forward layers) are analyzed in this context, identifying strategies and challenges for mapping dynamic matrix multiplications onto these novel hardware substrates. We then dissect the mechanisms of mainstream LLMs, such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and LLaMA, highlighting their architectural similarities and differences. We synthesize state-of-the-art components, algorithms, and integration methods, highlighting key advances and open issues in scaling such systems to mega-sized LLM models. We find that photonic computing systems could potentially surpass electronic processors by orders of magnitude in throughput and energy efficiency, but require breakthroughs in memory, especially for long-context windows and long token sequences, and in storage of ultra-large datasets.

Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for approximately 38% of building energy consumption globally, making them one of the most energy-intensive services. The increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and sustainability, combined with the need for enhanced occupant comfort, presents a significant challenge for traditional HVAC systems. These systems often fail to dynamically adjust to real-time changes in electricity market rates or individual comfort preferences, leading to increased energy costs and reduced comfort. In response, we propose a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Artificial Intelligence framework that optimizes HVAC performance by incorporating real-time user feedback and responding to fluctuating electricity prices. Unlike conventional systems that require predefined information about occupancy or comfort levels, our approach learns and adapts based on ongoing user input. By integrating the occupancy prediction model with reinforcement learning, the system improves operational efficiency and reduces energy costs in line with electricity market dynamics, thereby contributing to demand response initiatives. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our method achieves significant cost reductions compared to baseline approaches while maintaining or enhancing occupant comfort. This feedback-driven approach ensures personalized comfort control without the need for predefined settings, offering a scalable solution that balances individual preferences with economic and environmental goals.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models face deployment challenges due to their large parameter counts and computational demands. We explore quantization for MoE models and highlight two key insights: 1) linear blocks exhibit varying quantization sensitivity, and 2) divergent expert activation frequencies create heterogeneous computational characteristics. Based on these observations, we introduce MxMoE, a mixed-precision optimization framework for MoE models that considers both algorithmic and system perspectives. MxMoE navigates the design space defined by parameter sensitivity, expert activation dynamics, and hardware resources to derive efficient mixed-precision configurations. Additionally, MxMoE automatically generates optimized mixed-precision GroupGEMM kernels, enabling parallel execution of GEMMs with different precisions. Evaluations show that MxMoE outperforms existing methods, achieving 2.4 lower Wikitext-2 perplexity than GPTQ at 2.25-bit and delivering up to 3.4x speedup over full precision, as well as up to 29.4% speedup over uniform quantization at equivalent accuracy with 5-bit weight-activation quantization. Our code is available at https://github.com/cat538/MxMoE.

Abstract: The strong planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fostered the development of agent-based systems capable of leveraging external tools and interacting with increasingly complex environments. However, these powerful features also introduce a critical security risk: indirect prompt injection, a sophisticated attack vector that compromises the core of these agents, the LLM, by manipulating contextual information rather than direct user prompts. In this work, we propose a generic black-box fuzzing framework, AgentXploit, designed to automatically discover and exploit indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities across diverse LLM agents. Our approach starts by constructing a high-quality initial seed corpus, then employs a seed selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively refine inputs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of uncovering agent weaknesses. We evaluate AgentXploit on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo and VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based on o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of baseline attacks. Moreover, AgentXploit exhibits strong transferability across unseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses. Beyond benchmark evaluations, we apply our attacks in real-world environments, successfully misleading agents to navigate to arbitrary URLs, including malicious sites.

Abstract: We propose a model for the evolutionary ecology of words as one attempt to extend evolutionary game theory and agent-based models by utilizing the rich linguistic expressions of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our model enables the emergence and evolution of diverse and infinite options for interactions among agents. Within the population, each agent possesses a short word (or phrase) generated by an LLM and moves within a spatial environment. When agents become adjacent, the outcome of their interaction is determined by the LLM based on the relationship between their words, with the loser's word being replaced by the winner's. Word mutations, also based on LLM outputs, may occur. We conducted preliminary experiments assuming that ``strong animal species" would survive. The results showed that from an initial population consisting of well-known species, many species emerged both gradually and in a punctuated equilibrium manner. Each trial demonstrated the unique evolution of diverse populations, with one type of large species becoming dominant, such as terrestrial animals, marine life, or extinct species, which were ecologically specialized and adapted ones across diverse extreme habitats. We also conducted a long-term experiment with a large population, demonstrating the emergence and coexistence of diverse species.

Abstract: Data driven discovery of partial differential equations (PDEs) is a promising approach for uncovering the underlying laws governing complex systems. However, purely data driven techniques face the dilemma of balancing search space with optimization efficiency. This study introduces a knowledge guided approach that incorporates existing PDEs documented in a mathematical handbook to facilitate the discovery process. These PDEs are encoded as sentence like structures composed of operators and basic terms, and used to train a generative model, called EqGPT, which enables the generation of free form PDEs. A loop of generation evaluation optimization is constructed to autonomously identify the most suitable PDE. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework can recover a variety of PDE forms with high accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly in cases involving complex temporal derivatives or intricate spatial terms, which are often beyond the reach of conventional methods. The approach also exhibits generalizability to irregular spatial domains and higher dimensional settings. Notably, it succeeds in discovering a previously unreported PDE governing strongly nonlinear surface gravity waves propagating toward breaking, based on real world experimental data, highlighting its applicability to practical scenarios and its potential to support scientific discovery.

<title>Towards Facial Image Compression with Consistency Preserving Diffusion Prior</title>

Abstract: With the widespread application of facial image data across various domains, the efficient storage and transmission of facial images has garnered significant attention. However, the existing learned face image compression methods often produce unsatisfactory reconstructed image quality at low bit rates. Simply adapting diffusion-based compression methods to facial compression tasks results in reconstructed images that perform poorly in downstream applications due to insufficient preservation of high-frequency information. To further explore the diffusion prior in facial image compression, we propose Facial Image Compression with a Stable Diffusion Prior (FaSDiff), a method that preserves consistency through frequency enhancement. FaSDiff employs a high-frequency-sensitive compressor in an end-to-end framework to capture fine image details and produce robust visual prompts. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid low-frequency enhancement module that disentangles low-frequency facial semantics and stably modulates the diffusion prior alongside visual prompts. The proposed modules allow FaSDiff to leverage diffusion priors for superior human visual perception while minimizing performance loss in machine vision due to semantic inconsistency. Extensive experiments show that FaSDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in balancing human visual quality and machine vision accuracy. The code will be released after the paper is accepted.

<title>Multi-Modal Molecular Representation Learning via Structure Awareness</title>

Abstract: Accurate extraction of molecular representations is a critical step in the drug discovery process. In recent years, significant progress has been made in molecular representation learning methods, among which multi-modal molecular representation methods based on images, and 2D/3D topologies have become increasingly mainstream. However, existing these multi-modal approaches often directly fuse information from different modalities, overlooking the potential of intermodal interactions and failing to adequately capture the complex higher-order relationships and invariant features between molecules. To overcome these challenges, we propose a structure-awareness-based multi-modal self-supervised molecular representation pre-training framework (MMSA) designed to enhance molecular graph representations by leveraging invariant knowledge between molecules. The framework consists of two main modules: the multi-modal molecular representation learning module and the structure-awareness module. The multi-modal molecular representation learning module collaboratively processes information from different modalities of the same molecule to overcome intermodal differences and generate a unified molecular embedding. Subsequently, the structure-awareness module enhances the molecular representation by constructing a hypergraph structure to model higher-order correlations between molecules. This module also introduces a memory mechanism for storing typical molecular representations, aligning them with memory anchors in the memory bank to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the model generalization ability. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of MMSA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MoleculeNet benchmark, with average ROC-AUC improvements ranging from 1.8% to 9.6% over baseline methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in Protein Structure Prediction Models (PPMs), such as AlphaFold2 and ESMFold, have revolutionized computational biology by achieving unprecedented accuracy in predicting three-dimensional protein folding structures. However, these models face significant scalability challenges, particularly when processing proteins with long amino acid sequences (e.g., sequence length > 1,000). The primary bottleneck that arises from the exponential growth in activation sizes is driven by the unique data structure in PPM, which introduces an additional dimension that leads to substantial memory and computational demands. These limitations have hindered the effective scaling of PPM for real-world applications, such as analyzing large proteins or complex multimers with critical biological and pharmaceutical relevance.
  In this paper, we present LightNobel, the first hardware-software co-designed accelerator developed to overcome scalability limitations on the sequence length in PPM. At the software level, we propose Token-wise Adaptive Activation Quantization (AAQ), which leverages unique token-wise characteristics, such as distogram patterns in PPM activations, to enable fine-grained quantization techniques without compromising accuracy. At the hardware level, LightNobel integrates the multi-precision reconfigurable matrix processing unit (RMPU) and versatile vector processing unit (VVPU) to enable the efficient execution of AAQ. Through these innovations, LightNobel achieves up to 8.44x, 8.41x speedup and 37.29x, 43.35x higher power efficiency over the latest NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs, respectively, while maintaining negligible accuracy loss. It also reduces the peak memory requirement up to 120.05x in PPM, enabling scalable processing for proteins with long sequences.

Abstract: Modern automotive infotainment systems require intelligent and adaptive solutions to handle frequent User Interface (UI) updates and diverse design variations. We introduce a vision-language framework for understanding and interacting with automotive infotainment systems, enabling seamless adaptation across different UI designs. To further support research in this field, we release AutomotiveUI-Bench-4K, an open-source dataset of 998 images with 4,208 annotations. Additionally, we present a synthetic data pipeline to generate training data. We fine-tune a Molmo-7B-based model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa) and incorporating reasoning generated by our pipeline, along with visual grounding and evaluation capabilities. The fine-tuned Evaluative Large Action Model (ELAM) achieves strong performance on AutomotiveUI-Bench-4K (model and dataset are available on Hugging Face) and demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization, including a +5.2% improvement on ScreenSpot over the baseline model. Notably, our approach achieves 80.4% average accuracy on ScreenSpot, closely matching or even surpassing specialized models for desktop, mobile, and web, such as ShowUI, despite being trained for the infotainment domain. This research investigates how data collection and subsequent fine-tuning can lead to AI-driven progress within automotive UI understanding and interaction. The applied method is cost-efficient and fine-tuned models can be deployed on consumer-grade GPUs.

Abstract: In this paper, we go beyond identifying anomalies only in structural terms and think about better anomaly detection motivated by anomaly causes. Most anomalies are regarded as the result of unpredictable defective forces from internal and external sources, and their opposite forces are sought to correct the anomalies. We introduced a Mechanics Complementary framework for 3D anomaly detection (MC4AD) to generate internal and external Corrective forces for each point. A Diverse Anomaly-Generation (DA-Gen) module is first proposed to simulate various anomalies. Then, we present a Corrective Force Prediction Network (CFP-Net) with complementary representations for point-level representation to simulate the different contributions of internal and external corrective forces. A combined loss was proposed, including a new symmetric loss and an overall loss, to constrain the corrective forces properly. As a highlight, we consider 3D anomaly detection in industry more comprehensively, creating a hierarchical quality control strategy based on a three-way decision and contributing a dataset named Anomaly-IntraVariance with intraclass variance to evaluate the model. On the proposed and existing five datasets, we obtained nine state-of-the-art performers with the minimum parameters and the fastest inference speed.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets are time series that are sequentially collected and contain rich temporal information. Thus, a common interest in practice is to capture dynamics of time series and predict their future evolutions. To this end, the recurrent neural network (RNN) has been a prevalent and effective machine learning option, which admits a nonlinear state-space model representation. Motivated by the resemblance between RNN and Kalman filter (KF) for linear state-space models, we propose in this paper Innovation-driven RNN (IRNN), a novel RNN architecture tailored to time-series data modeling and prediction tasks. By adapting the concept of "innovation" from KF to RNN, past prediction errors are adopted as additional input signals to update hidden states of RNN and boost prediction performance. Since innovation data depend on network parameters, existing training algorithms for RNN do not apply to IRNN straightforwardly. Thus, a tailored training algorithm dubbed input updating-based back-propagation through time (IU-BPTT) is further proposed, which alternates between updating innovations and optimizing network parameters via gradient descent. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets show that the integration of innovations into various forms of RNN leads to remarkably improved prediction accuracy of IRNN without increasing the training cost substantially.

Abstract: The emergence of ConvNeXt and its variants has reaffirmed the conceptual and structural suitability of CNN-based models for vision tasks, re-establishing them as key players in image classification in general, and in facial expression recognition (FER) in particular. In this paper, we propose a new set of models that build on these advancements by incorporating a new set of attention mechanisms that combines Triplet attention with Squeeze-and-Excitation (TripSE) in four different variants. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these variants by applying them to the ResNet18, DenseNet and ConvNext architectures to validate their versatility and impact. Our study shows that incorporating a TripSE block in these CNN models boosts their performances, particularly for the ConvNeXt architecture, indicating its utility. We evaluate the proposed mechanisms and associated models across four datasets, namely CIFAR100, ImageNet, FER2013 and AffectNet datasets, where ConvNext with TripSE achieves state-of-the-art results with an accuracy of \textbf{78.27\%} on the popular FER2013 dataset, a new feat for this dataset.

Abstract: Community detection in networks with overlapping structures remains a significant challenge, particularly in noisy real-world environments where integrating topology, node attributes, and prior information is critical. To address this, we propose a semi-supervised graph autoencoder that combines graph multi-head attention and modularity maximization to robustly detect overlapping communities. The model learns semantic representations by fusing structural, attribute, and prior knowledge while explicitly addressing noise in node features. Key innovations include a noise-resistant architecture and a semantic semi-supervised design optimized for community quality through modularity constraints. Experiments demonstrate superior performance the model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in overlapping community detection (improvements in NMI and F1-score) and exhibits exceptional robustness to attribute noise, maintaining stable performance under 60\% feature corruption.

<title>Universal Approximation Theorem for Deep Q-Learning via FBSDE System</title>

Abstract: The approximation capabilities of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) are commonly justified by general Universal Approximation Theorems (UATs) that do not leverage the intrinsic structural properties of the optimal Q-function, the solution to a Bellman equation. This paper establishes a UAT for a class of DQNs whose architecture is designed to emulate the iterative refinement process inherent in Bellman updates. A central element of our analysis is the propagation of regularity: while the transformation induced by a single Bellman operator application exhibits regularity, for which Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) theory provides analytical tools, the uniform regularity of the entire sequence of value iteration iterates--specifically, their uniform Lipschitz continuity on compact domains under standard Lipschitz assumptions on the problem data--is derived from finite-horizon dynamic programming principles. We demonstrate that layers of a deep residual network, conceived as neural operators acting on function spaces, can approximate the action of the Bellman operator. The resulting approximation theorem is thus intrinsically linked to the control problem's structure, offering a proof technique wherein network depth directly corresponds to iterations of value function refinement, accompanied by controlled error propagation. This perspective reveals a dynamic systems view of the network's operation on a space of value functions.

Abstract: Irregular temporal data, characterized by varying recording frequencies, differing observation durations, and missing values, presents significant challenges across fields like mobility, healthcare, and environmental science. Existing research communities often overlook or address these challenges in isolation, leading to fragmented tools and methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified framework, and the first standardized dataset repository for irregular time series classification, built on a common array format to enhance interoperability. This repository comprises 34 datasets on which we benchmark 12 classifier models from diverse domains and communities. This work aims to centralize research efforts and enable a more robust evaluation of irregular temporal data analysis methods.

Abstract: The increasing demand for generative AI as Large Language Models (LLMs) services has driven the need for specialized hardware architectures that optimize computational efficiency and energy consumption. This paper evaluates the performance of the Tenstorrent Grayskull e75 RISC-V accelerator for basic linear algebra kernels at reduced numerical precision, a fundamental operation in LLM computations. We present a detailed characterization of Grayskull's execution model, gridsize, matrix dimensions, data formats, and numerical precision impact computational efficiency. Furthermore, we compare Grayskull's performance against state-of-the-art architectures with tensor acceleration, including Intel Sapphire Rapids processors and two NVIDIA GPUs (V100 and A100). Whilst NVIDIA GPUs dominate raw performance, Grayskull demonstrates a competitive trade-off between power consumption and computational throughput, reaching a peak of 1.55 TFLOPs/Watt with BF16.

Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a powerful technique for automatically discovering mathematical expressions from input data. Mainstream SR algorithms search for the optimal symbolic tree in a vast function space, but the increasing complexity of the tree structure limits their performance. Inspired by neural networks, symbolic networks have emerged as a promising new paradigm. However, most existing symbolic networks still face certain challenges: binary nonlinear operators $\{\times, \div\}$ cannot be naturally extended to multivariate operators, and training with fixed architecture often leads to higher complexity and overfitting. In this work, we propose a Unified Symbolic Network that unifies nonlinear binary operators into nested unary operators and define the conditions under which UniSymNet can reduce complexity. Moreover, we pre-train a Transformer model with a novel label encoding method to guide structural selection, and adopt objective-specific optimization strategies to learn the parameters of the symbolic network. UniSymNet shows high fitting accuracy, excellent symbolic solution rate, and relatively low expression complexity, achieving competitive performance on low-dimensional Standard Benchmarks and high-dimensional SRBench.

Abstract: This study systematically evaluates 27 frontier Large Language Models on eight diverse biology benchmarks spanning molecular biology, genetics, cloning, virology, and biosecurity. Models from major AI developers released between November 2022 and April 2025 were assessed through ten independent runs per benchmark. The findings reveal dramatic improvements in biological capabilities. Top model performance increased more than 4-fold on the challenging text-only subset of the Virology Capabilities Test over the study period, with the top model now performing twice as well as expert virologists. Several models now match or exceed expert-level performance on other challenging benchmarks, including LAB-Bench CloningScenarios and the biology subsets of GPQA and WMDP. Contrary to expectations, chain-of-thought did not substantially improve performance over zero-shot evaluation, while extended reasoning features in o3-mini and Claude 3.7 Sonnet typically improved performance as predicted by inference scaling. Benchmarks such as PubMedQA and the MMLU and WMDP biology subsets exhibited performance plateaus well below 100%, suggesting benchmark saturation and errors in the underlying benchmark data. The analysis highlights the need for more sophisticated evaluation methodologies as AI systems continue to advance.

Abstract: This project performs multimodal sentiment analysis using the CMU-MOSEI dataset, using transformer-based models with early fusion to integrate text, audio, and visual modalities. We employ BERT-based encoders for each modality, extracting embeddings that are concatenated before classification. The model achieves strong performance, with 97.87\% 7-class accuracy and a 0.9682 F1-score on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of early fusion in capturing cross-modal interactions. The training utilized Adam optimization (lr=1e-4), dropout (0.3), and early stopping to ensure generalization and robustness. Results highlight the superiority of transformer architectures in modeling multimodal sentiment, with a low MAE (0.1060) indicating precise sentiment intensity prediction. Future work may compare fusion strategies or enhance interpretability. This approach utilizes multimodal learning by effectively combining linguistic, acoustic, and visual cues for sentiment analysis.

Abstract: A generalist robot should perform effectively across various environments. However, most existing approaches heavily rely on scaling action-annotated data to enhance their capabilities. Consequently, they are often limited to single physical specification and struggle to learn transferable knowledge across different embodiments and environments. To confront these limitations, we propose UniVLA, a new framework for learning cross-embodiment vision-language-action (VLA) policies. Our key innovation is to derive task-centric action representations from videos with a latent action model. This enables us to exploit extensive data across a wide spectrum of embodiments and perspectives. To mitigate the effect of task-irrelevant dynamics, we incorporate language instructions and establish a latent action model within the DINO feature space. Learned from internet-scale videos, the generalist policy can be deployed to various robots through efficient latent action decoding. We obtain state-of-the-art results across multiple manipulation and navigation benchmarks, as well as real-robot deployments. UniVLA achieves superior performance over OpenVLA with less than 1/20 of pretraining compute and 1/10 of downstream data. Continuous performance improvements are observed as heterogeneous data, even including human videos, are incorporated into the training pipeline. The results underscore UniVLA's potential to facilitate scalable and efficient robot policy learning.

Abstract: Automatic lymph node segmentation is the cornerstone for advances in computer vision tasks for early detection and staging of cancer. Traditional segmentation methods are constrained by manual delineation and variability in operator proficiency, limiting their ability to achieve high accuracy. The introduction of deep learning technologies offers new possibilities for improving the accuracy of lymph node image analysis. This study evaluates the application of deep learning in lymph node segmentation and discusses the methodologies of various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, encoder-decoder networks, and transformers in analyzing medical imaging data across different modalities. Despite the advancements, it still confronts challenges like the shape diversity of lymph nodes, the scarcity of accurately labeled datasets, and the inadequate development of methods that are robust and generalizable across different imaging modalities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a comprehensive overview of the application of deep learning techniques in lymph node segmentation task. Furthermore, this study also explores potential future research directions, including multimodal fusion techniques, transfer learning, and the use of large-scale pre-trained models to overcome current limitations while enhancing cancer diagnosis and treatment planning strategies.

Abstract: Wasserstein distances provide a powerful framework for comparing data distributions. They can be used to analyze processes over time or to detect inhomogeneities within data. However, simply calculating the Wasserstein distance or analyzing the corresponding transport map (or coupling) may not be sufficient for understanding what factors contribute to a high or low Wasserstein distance. In this work, we propose a novel solution based on Explainable AI that allows us to efficiently and accurately attribute Wasserstein distances to various data components, including data subgroups, input features, or interpretable subspaces. Our method achieves high accuracy across diverse datasets and Wasserstein distance specifications, and its practical utility is demonstrated in two use cases.

Abstract: This dissertation considers Open-world Robot Manipulation, a manipulation problem where a robot must generalize or quickly adapt to new objects, scenes, or tasks for which it has not been pre-programmed or pre-trained. This dissertation tackles the problem using a methodology of efficient sensorimotor learning. The key to enabling efficient sensorimotor learning lies in leveraging regular patterns that exist in limited amounts of demonstration data. These patterns, referred to as ``regularity,'' enable the data-efficient learning of generalizable manipulation skills. This dissertation offers a new perspective on formulating manipulation problems through the lens of regularity. Building upon this notion, we introduce three major contributions. First, we introduce methods that endow robots with object-centric priors, allowing them to learn generalizable, closed-loop sensorimotor policies from a small number of teleoperation demonstrations. Second, we introduce methods that constitute robots' spatial understanding, unlocking their ability to imitate manipulation skills from in-the-wild video observations. Last but not least, we introduce methods that enable robots to identify reusable skills from their past experiences, resulting in systems that can continually imitate multiple tasks in a sequential manner. Altogether, the contributions of this dissertation help lay the groundwork for building general-purpose personal robots that can quickly adapt to new situations or tasks with low-cost data collection and interact easily with humans. By enabling robots to learn and generalize from limited data, this dissertation takes a step toward realizing the vision of intelligent robotic assistants that can be seamlessly integrated into everyday scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a scaling law for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) under fixed compute budgets that explicitly accounts for data composition. Conventional approaches measure training data solely by total tokens, yet the number of examples and their average token length -- what we term \emph{dataset volume} -- play a decisive role in model performance. Our formulation is tuned following established procedures. Experiments on the BRICC dataset \cite{salavati2024reducing} and subsets of the MMLU dataset \cite{hendrycks2021measuringmassivemultitasklanguage}, evaluated under multiple subsampling strategies, reveal that data composition significantly affects token efficiency. These results motivate refined scaling laws for practical LLM fine-tuning in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as clinical assistants across various medical fields. However, specialized dermatology VLM capable of delivering professional and detailed diagnostic analysis remains underdeveloped, primarily due to less specialized text descriptions in current dermatology multimodal datasets. To address this issue, we propose MM-Skin, the first large-scale multimodal dermatology dataset that encompasses 3 imaging modalities, including clinical, dermoscopic, and pathological and nearly 10k high-quality image-text pairs collected from professional textbooks. In addition, we generate over 27k diverse, instruction-following vision question answering (VQA) samples (9 times the size of current largest dermatology VQA dataset). Leveraging public datasets and MM-Skin, we developed SkinVL, a dermatology-specific VLM designed for precise and nuanced skin disease interpretation. Comprehensive benchmark evaluations of SkinVL on VQA, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and zero-shot classification tasks across 8 datasets, reveal its exceptional performance for skin diseases in comparison to both general and medical VLM models. The introduction of MM-Skin and SkinVL offers a meaningful contribution to advancing the development of clinical dermatology VLM assistants. MM-Skin is available at https://github.com/ZwQ803/MM-Skin

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel in-context learning (ICL) framework, inspired by large language models (LLMs), for soft-input soft-output channel equalization in coded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed approach learns to infer posterior symbol distributions directly from a prompt of pilot signals and decoder feedback. A key innovation is the use of prompt augmentation to incorporate extrinsic information from the decoder output as additional context, enabling the ICL model to refine its symbol estimates iteratively across turbo decoding iterations. Two model variants, based on Transformer and state-space architectures, are developed and evaluated. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, when traditional linear assumptions break down, e.g., in the presence of low-resolution quantization, ICL equalizers consistently outperform conventional model-based baselines, even when the latter are provided with perfect channel state information. Results also highlight the advantage of Transformer-based models under limited training diversity, as well as the efficiency of state-space models in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Extracting scientific evidence from biomedical studies for clinical research questions (e.g., Does stem cell transplantation improve quality of life in patients with medically refractory Crohn's disease compared to placebo?) is a crucial step in synthesising biomedical evidence. In this paper, we focus on the task of document-level scientific evidence extraction for clinical questions with conflicting evidence. To support this task, we create a dataset called CochraneForest, leveraging forest plots from Cochrane systematic reviews. It comprises 202 annotated forest plots, associated clinical research questions, full texts of studies, and study-specific conclusions. Building on CochraneForest, we propose URCA (Uniform Retrieval Clustered Augmentation), a retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to tackle the unique challenges of evidence extraction. Our experiments show that URCA outperforms the best existing methods by up to 10.3% in F1 score on this task. However, the results also underscore the complexity of CochraneForest, establishing it as a challenging testbed for advancing automated evidence synthesis systems.

Abstract: Hiking on complex trails demands balance, agility, and adaptive decision-making over unpredictable terrain. Current humanoid research remains fragmented and inadequate for hiking: locomotion focuses on motor skills without long-term goals or situational awareness, while semantic navigation overlooks real-world embodiment and local terrain variability. We propose training humanoids to hike on complex trails, driving integrative skill development across visual perception, decision making, and motor execution. We develop a learning framework, LEGO-H, that enables a vision-equipped humanoid robot to hike complex trails autonomously. We introduce two technical innovations: 1) A temporal vision transformer variant - tailored into Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework - anticipates future local goals to guide movement, seamlessly integrating locomotion with goal-directed navigation. 2) Latent representations of joint movement patterns, combined with hierarchical metric learning - enhance Privileged Learning scheme - enable smooth policy transfer from privileged training to onboard execution. These components allow LEGO-H to handle diverse physical and environmental challenges without relying on predefined motion patterns. Experiments across varied simulated trails and robot morphologies highlight LEGO-H's versatility and robustness, positioning hiking as a compelling testbed for embodied autonomy and LEGO-H as a baseline for future humanoid development.

Abstract: We introduce Attentive VLM Agent (AVA), a multimodal StarCraft II agent that aligns artificial agent perception with the human gameplay experience. Traditional frameworks such as SMAC rely on abstract state representations that diverge significantly from human perception, limiting the ecological validity of agent behavior. Our agent addresses this limitation by incorporating RGB visual inputs and natural language observations that more closely simulate human cognitive processes during gameplay. The AVA architecture consists of three integrated components: (1) a vision-language model enhanced with specialized self-attention mechanisms for strategic unit targeting and battlefield assessment, (2) a retrieval-augmented generation system that leverages domain-specific StarCraft II knowledge to inform tactical decisions, and (3) a dynamic role-based task distribution system that enables coordinated multi-agent behavior. The experimental evaluation in our proposed AVACraft environment, which contains 21 multimodal StarCraft II scenarios, demonstrates that AVA powered by foundation models (specifically Qwen-VL and GPT-4o) can execute complex tactical maneuvers without explicit training, achieving comparable performance to traditional MARL methods that require substantial training iterations. This work establishes a foundation for developing human-aligned StarCraft II agents and advances the broader research agenda of multimodal game AI. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/camel-ai/VLM-Play-StarCraft2.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in machine learning, current AI systems continue to fall short of true human-like intelligence. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in pattern recognition and response generation, they lack genuine understanding - an essential hallmark of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Existing AGI evaluation methods fail to offer a practical, gradual, and informative metric. This paper introduces the Artificial General Intelligence Test Bed (AGITB), comprising twelve rigorous tests that form a signal-processing-level foundation for the potential emergence of cognitive capabilities. AGITB evaluates intelligence through a model's ability to predict binary signals across time without relying on symbolic representations or pretraining. Unlike high-level tests grounded in language or perception, AGITB focuses on core computational invariants reflective of biological intelligence, such as determinism, sensitivity, and generalisation. The test bed assumes no prior bias, operates independently of semantic meaning, and ensures unsolvability through brute force or memorization. While humans pass AGITB by design, no current AI system has met its criteria, making AGITB a compelling benchmark for guiding and recognizing progress toward AGI.

Abstract: Radio maps (RMs) are essential for environment-aware communication and sensing, providing location-specific wireless channel information. Existing RM construction methods often rely on precise environmental data and base station (BS) locations, which are not always available in dynamic or privacy-sensitive environments. While sparse measurement techniques reduce data collection, the impact of noise in sparse data on RM accuracy is not well understood. This paper addresses these challenges by formulating RM construction as a Bayesian inverse problem under coarse environmental knowledge and noisy sparse measurements. Although maximum a posteriori (MAP) filtering offers an optimal solution, it requires a precise prior distribution of the RM, which is typically unavailable. To solve this, we propose RadioDiff-Inverse, a diffusion-enhanced Bayesian inverse estimation framework that uses an unconditional generative diffusion model to learn the RM prior. This approach not only reconstructs the spatial distribution of wireless channel features but also enables environmental structure perception, such as building outlines, and location of BS just relay on pathloss, through integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Remarkably, RadioDiff-Inverse is training-free, leveraging a pre-trained model from Imagenet without task-specific fine-tuning, which significantly reduces the training cost of using generative large model in wireless networks. Experimental results demonstrate that RadioDiff-Inverse achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy of RM construction and environmental reconstruction, and robustness against noisy sparse sampling.

Abstract: Scalable oversight, the process by which weaker AI systems supervise stronger ones, has been proposed as a key strategy to control future superintelligent systems. However, it is still unclear how scalable oversight itself scales. To address this gap, we propose a framework that quantifies the probability of successful oversight as a function of the capabilities of the overseer and the system being overseen. Specifically, our framework models oversight as a game between capability-mismatched players; the players have oversight-specific Elo scores that are a piecewise-linear function of their general intelligence, with two plateaus corresponding to task incompetence and task saturation. We validate our framework with a modified version of the game Nim and then apply it to four oversight games: Mafia, Debate, Backdoor Code and Wargames. For each game, we find scaling laws that approximate how domain performance depends on general AI system capability. We then build on our findings in a theoretical study of Nested Scalable Oversight (NSO), a process in which trusted models oversee untrusted stronger models, which then become the trusted models in the next step. We identify conditions under which NSO succeeds and derive numerically (and in some cases analytically) the optimal number of oversight levels to maximize the probability of oversight success. We also apply our theory to our four oversight games, where we find that NSO success rates at a general Elo gap of 400 are 13.5% for Mafia, 51.7% for Debate, 10.0% for Backdoor Code, and 9.4% for Wargames; these rates decline further when overseeing stronger systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel interdisciplinary framework for analyzing police body-worn camera (BWC) footage from the Rochester Police Department (RPD) using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and statistical machine learning (ML) techniques. Our goal is to detect, classify, and analyze patterns of interaction between police officers and civilians to identify key behavioral dynamics, such as respect, disrespect, escalation, and de-escalation. We apply multimodal data analysis by integrating video, audio, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful insights from BWC footage. We present our methodology, computational techniques, and findings, outlining a practical approach for law enforcement while advancing the frontiers of knowledge discovery from police BWC data.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, the end-to-end (E2E) driving approach that predicts vehicle control signals directly from sensor data is rapidly gaining attention. To learn a safe E2E driving system, one needs an extensive amount of driving data and human intervention. Vehicle control data is constructed by many hours of human driving, and it is challenging to construct large vehicle control datasets. Often, publicly available driving datasets are collected with limited driving scenes, and collecting vehicle control data is only available by vehicle manufacturers. To address these challenges, this letter proposes the first fully self-supervised learning framework, self-supervised imitation learning (SSIL), for E2E driving, based on the self-supervised regression learning (SSRL) framework.The proposed SSIL framework can learn E2E driving networks \emph{without} using driving command data or a pre-trained model. To construct pseudo steering angle data, proposed SSIL predicts a pseudo target from the vehicle's poses at the current and previous time points that are estimated with light detection and ranging sensors. In addition, we propose two E2E driving networks that predict driving commands depending on high-level instruction. Our numerical experiments with three different benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SSIL framework achieves \emph{very} comparable E2E driving accuracy with the supervised learning counterpart. The proposed pseudo-label predictor outperformed an existing one using proportional integral derivative controller.

Abstract: Training a deep neural network to maximize a target objective has become the standard recipe for successful machine learning over the last decade. These networks can be optimized with supervised learning, if the target objective is differentiable. For many interesting problems, this is however not the case. Common objectives like intersection over union (IoU), bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score or rewards cannot be optimized with supervised learning. A common workaround is to define differentiable surrogate losses, leading to suboptimal solutions with respect to the actual objective. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising alternative for optimizing deep neural networks to maximize non-differentiable objectives in recent years. Examples include aligning large language models via human feedback, code generation, object detection or control problems. This makes RL techniques relevant to the larger machine learning audience. The subject is, however, time intensive to approach due to the large range of methods, as well as the often very theoretical presentation. In this introduction, we take an alternative approach, different from classic reinforcement learning textbooks. Rather than focusing on tabular problems, we introduce reinforcement learning as a generalization of supervised learning, which we first apply to non-differentiable objectives and later to temporal problems. Assuming only basic knowledge of supervised learning, the reader will be able to understand state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms like proximal policy optimization (PPO) after reading this tutorial.

Abstract: People experiencing severe distress increasingly use Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots as mental health support tools. Discussions on social media have described how engagements were lifesaving for some, but evidence suggests that general-purpose LLM chatbots also have notable risks that could endanger the welfare of users if not designed responsibly. In this study, we investigate the lived experiences of people who have used LLM chatbots for mental health support. We build on interviews with 21 individuals from globally diverse backgrounds to analyze how users create unique support roles for their chatbots, fill in gaps in everyday care, and navigate associated cultural limitations when seeking support from chatbots. We ground our analysis in psychotherapy literature around effective support, and introduce the concept of therapeutic alignment, or aligning AI with therapeutic values for mental health contexts. Our study offers recommendations for how designers can approach the ethical and effective use of LLM chatbots and other AI mental health support tools in mental health care.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large AI Models (LAIMs), particularly diffusion models and large language models, has marked a new era where AI-generated multimedia is increasingly integrated into various aspects of daily life. Although beneficial in numerous fields, this content presents significant risks, including potential misuse, societal disruptions, and ethical concerns. Consequently, detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs has become crucial, with a marked rise in related research. Despite this, there remains a notable gap in systematic surveys that focus specifically on detecting LAIM-generated multimedia. Addressing this, we provide the first survey to comprehensively cover existing research on detecting multimedia (such as text, images, videos, audio, and multimodal content) created by LAIMs. Specifically, we introduce a novel taxonomy for detection methods, categorized by media modality, and aligned with two perspectives: pure detection (aiming to enhance detection performance) and beyond detection (adding attributes like generalizability, robustness, and interpretability to detectors). Additionally, we have presented a brief overview of generation mechanisms, public datasets, online detection tools, and evaluation metrics to provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in this field. Most importantly, we offer a focused analysis from a social media perspective to highlight their broader societal impact. Furthermore, we identify current challenges in detection and propose directions for future research that address unexplored, ongoing, and emerging issues in detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs. Our aim for this survey is to fill an academic gap and contribute to global AI security efforts, helping to ensure the integrity of information in the digital realm.

<title>Image space formalism of convolutional neural networks for k-space interpolation</title>

Abstract: Purpose: Noise resilience in image reconstructions by scan-specific robust artificial neural networks for k-space interpolation (RAKI) is linked to nonlinear activations in k-space. To gain a deeper understanding of this relationship, an image space formalism of RAKI is introduced for analyzing noise propagation analytically, identifying and characterizing image reconstruction features and to describe the role of nonlinear activations in a human readable manner. Methods: The image space formalism for RAKI inference is employed by expressing nonlinear activations in k-space as element-wise multiplications with activation masks, which transform into convolutions in image space. Jacobians of the de-aliased, coil-combined image relative to the aliased coil images can be expressed algebraically, and thus, the noise amplification is quantified analytically (g-factor maps). We analyze the role of nonlinearity for noise resilience by controlling the degree of nonlinearity in the reconstruction model via the negative slope parameter in leaky ReLU. Results: The analytical g-factor maps correspond with those obtained from Monte Carlo simulations and from an auto differentiation approach for in vivo brain images. Apparent blurring and contrast loss artifacts are identified as implications of enhanced noise resilience. These residual artifacts can be traded against noise resilience by adjusting the degree of nonlinearity in the model (Tikhonov-like regularization) in case of limited training data. The inspection of image space activations reveals an autocorrelation pattern leading to a potential center artifact. Conclusion: The image space formalism of RAKI provides the means for analytical quantitative noisepropagation analysis and human-readable visualization of the effects of the nonlinear activation functions in k-space.

<title>Neural Slot Interpreters: Grounding Object Semantics in Emergent Slot Representations</title>

Abstract: Several accounts of human cognition posit that our intelligence is rooted in our ability to form abstract composable concepts, ground them in our environment, and reason over these grounded entities. This trifecta of human thought has remained elusive in modern intelligent machines. In this work, we investigate whether slot representations extracted from visual scenes serve as appropriate compositional abstractions for grounding and reasoning. We present the Neural Slot Interpreter (NSI), which learns to ground object semantics in slots. At the core of NSI is a nested schema that uses simple syntax rules to organize the object semantics of a scene into object-centric schema primitives. Then, the NSI metric learns to ground primitives into slots through a structured contrastive learning objective that reasons over the intermodal alignment. Experiments with a bi-modal object-property and scene retrieval task demonstrate the grounding efficacy and interpretability of correspondences learned by NSI. From a scene representation standpoint, we find that emergent NSI slots that move beyond the image grid by binding to spatial objects facilitate improved visual grounding compared to conventional bounding-box-based approaches. From a data efficiency standpoint, we empirically validate that NSI learns more generalizable representations from a fixed amount of annotation data than the traditional approach. We also show that the grounded slots surpass unsupervised slots in real-world object discovery and scale with scene complexity. Finally, we investigate the downstream efficacy of the grounded slots. Vision Transformers trained on grounding-aware NSI tokenizers using as few as ten tokens outperform patch-based tokens on challenging few-shot classification tasks.

Abstract: Testing is an essential part of software development. Test generation tools attempt to automate the otherwise labor-intensive task of test creation, but generating high-coverage tests remains challenging. This paper proposes CoverUp, a novel approach to driving the generation of high-coverage Python regression tests. CoverUp combines coverage analysis, code context, and feedback in prompts that iteratively guide the LLM to generate tests that improve line and branch coverage. We evaluate our prototype CoverUp implementation across a benchmark of challenging code derived from open-source Python projects and show that CoverUp substantially improves on the state of the art. Compared to CodaMosa, a hybrid search/LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves a per-module median line+branch coverage of 80% (vs. 47%). Compared to MuTAP, a mutation- and LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves an overall line+branch coverage of 89% (vs. 77%). We also demonstrate that CoverUp's performance stems not only from the LLM used but from the combined effectiveness of its components.

Abstract: This paper studies the challenge of developing robots capable of understanding under-specified instructions for creating functional object arrangements, such as "set up a dining table for two"; previous arrangement approaches have focused on much more explicit instructions, such as "put object A on the table." We introduce a framework, SetItUp, for learning to interpret under-specified instructions. SetItUp takes a small number of training examples and a human-crafted program sketch to uncover arrangement rules for specific scene types. By leveraging an intermediate graph-like representation of abstract spatial relationships among objects, SetItUp decomposes the arrangement problem into two subproblems: i) learning the arrangement patterns from limited data and ii) grounding these abstract relationships into object poses. SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to propose the abstract spatial relationships among objects in novel scenes as the constraints to be satisfied; then, it composes a library of diffusion models associated with these abstract relationships to find object poses that satisfy the constraints. We validate our framework on a dataset comprising study desks, dining tables, and coffee tables, with the results showing superior performance in generating physically plausible, functional, and aesthetically pleasing object arrangements compared to existing models.

<title>Credal Wrapper of Model Averaging for Uncertainty Estimation in Classification</title>

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative approach, called credal wrapper, to formulating a credal set representation of model averaging for Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and deep ensembles (DEs), capable of improving uncertainty estimation in classification tasks. Given a finite collection of single predictive distributions derived from BNNs or DEs, the proposed credal wrapper approach extracts an upper and a lower probability bound per class, acknowledging the epistemic uncertainty due to the availability of a limited amount of distributions. Such probability intervals over classes can be mapped on a convex set of probabilities (a credal set) from which, in turn, a unique prediction can be obtained using a transformation called intersection probability transformation. In this article, we conduct extensive experiments on several out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmarks, encompassing various dataset pairs (CIFAR10/100 vs SVHN/Tiny-ImageNet, CIFAR10 vs CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100 vs CIFAR100-C and ImageNet vs ImageNet-O) and using different network architectures (such as VGG16, ResNet-18/50, EfficientNet B2, and ViT Base). Compared to the BNN and DE baselines, the proposed credal wrapper method exhibits superior performance in uncertainty estimation and achieves a lower expected calibration error on corrupted data.

Abstract: For solving zero-sum games involving non-transitivity, a useful approach is to maintain a policy population to approximate the Nash Equilibrium (NE). Previous studies have shown that the Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) algorithm is an effective framework for solving such games. However, current methods initialize a new policy from scratch or inherit a single historical policy in Best Response (BR), missing the opportunity to leverage past policies to generate a better BR. In this paper, we propose Fusion-PSRO, which employs Nash Policy Fusion to initialize a new policy for BR training. Nash Policy Fusion serves as an implicit guiding policy that starts exploration on the current Meta-NE, thus providing a closer approximation to BR. Moreover, it insightfully captures a weighted moving average of past policies, dynamically adjusting these weights based on the Meta-NE in each iteration. This cumulative process further enhances the policy population. Empirical results on classic benchmarks show that Fusion-PSRO achieves lower exploitability, thereby mitigating the shortcomings of previous research on policy initialization in BR.

Abstract: Although it is known that transformer language models (LMs) pass features from early layers to later layers, it is not well understood how this information is represented and routed by the model. We analyze a mechanism used in two LMs to selectively inhibit items in a context in one task, and find that it underlies a commonly used abstraction across many context-retrieval behaviors. Specifically, we find that models write into low-rank subspaces of the residual stream to represent features which are then read out by later layers, forming low-rank communication channels (Elhage et al., 2021) between layers. A particular 3D subspace in model activations in GPT-2 can be traversed to positionally index items in lists, and we show that this mechanism can explain an otherwise arbitrary-seeming sensitivity of the model to the order of items in the prompt. That is, the model has trouble copying the correct information from context when many items ``crowd" this limited space. By decomposing attention heads with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), we find that previously described interactions between heads separated by one or more layers can be predicted via analysis of their weight matrices alone. We show that it is possible to manipulate the internal model representations as well as edit model weights based on the mechanism we discover in order to significantly improve performance on our synthetic Laundry List task, which requires recall from a list, often improving task accuracy by over 20%. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly intricate interpretable structure learned from language model pretraining, and helps us understand why sophisticated LMs sometimes fail in simple domains, facilitating future analysis of more complex behaviors.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising paradigm for training Large Language Models (LLMs) in a decentralized manner while preserving data privacy and minimizing communication overhead. This survey examines recent advancements in FL-driven LLMs, with a particular emphasis on architectural designs, performance optimization, and security concerns, including the emerging area of machine unlearning. In this context, machine unlearning refers to the systematic removal of specific data contributions from trained models to comply with privacy regulations such as the Right to be Forgotten. We review a range of strategies enabling unlearning in federated LLMs, including perturbation-based methods, model decomposition, and incremental retraining, while evaluating their trade-offs in terms of efficiency, privacy guarantees, and model utility. Through selected case studies and empirical evaluations, we analyze how these methods perform in practical FL scenarios. This survey identifies critical research directions toward developing secure, adaptable, and high-performing federated LLM systems for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) and Relation Extraction (RE) are fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing, serving as critical components in a wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose ReLiK, a Retriever-Reader architecture for both EL and RE, where, given an input text, the Retriever module undertakes the identification of candidate entities or relations that could potentially appear within the text. Subsequently, the Reader module is tasked to discern the pertinent retrieved entities or relations and establish their alignment with the corresponding textual spans. Notably, we put forward an innovative input representation that incorporates the candidate entities or relations alongside the text, making it possible to link entities or extract relations in a single forward pass and to fully leverage pre-trained language models contextualization capabilities, in contrast with previous Retriever-Reader-based methods, which require a forward pass for each candidate. Our formulation of EL and RE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks while using academic budget training and with up to 40x inference speed compared to competitors. Finally, we show how our architecture can be used seamlessly for Information Extraction (cIE), i.e. EL + RE, and setting a new state of the art by employing a shared Reader that simultaneously extracts entities and relations.

Abstract: Distributional drift detection is important in medical applications as it helps ensure the accuracy and reliability of models by identifying changes in the underlying data distribution that could affect the prediction results of machine learning models. However, current methods have limitations in detecting drift, for example, the inclusion of abnormal datasets can lead to unfair comparisons. This paper presents an accurate and sensitive approach to detect distributional drift in CT-scan medical images by leveraging data-sketching and fine-tuning techniques. We developed a robust baseline library model for real-time anomaly detection, allowing for efficient comparison of incoming images and identification of anomalies. Additionally, we fine-tuned a pre-trained Vision Transformer model to extract relevant features, using mammography as a case study, significantly enhancing model accuracy to 99.11%. Combining with data-sketches and fine-tuning, our feature extraction evaluation demonstrated that cosine similarity scores between similar datasets provide greater improvements, from around 50% increased to 99.1%. Finally, the sensitivity evaluation shows that our solutions are highly sensitive to even 1% salt-and-pepper and speckle noise, and it is not sensitive to lighting noise (e.g., lighting conditions have no impact on data drift). The proposed methods offer a scalable and reliable solution for maintaining the accuracy of diagnostic models in dynamic clinical environments.

Abstract: Being able to accurately monitor the screen exposure of young children is important for research on phenomena linked to screen use such as childhood obesity, physical activity, and social interaction. Most existing studies rely upon self-report or manual measures from bulky wearable sensors, thus lacking efficiency and accuracy in capturing quantitative screen exposure data. In this work, we developed a novel sensor informatics framework that utilizes egocentric images from a wearable sensor, termed the screen time tracker (STT), and a vision language model (VLM). In particular, we devised a multi-view VLM that takes multiple views from egocentric image sequences and interprets screen exposure dynamically. We validated our approach by using a dataset of children's free-living activities, demonstrating significant improvement over existing methods in plain vision language models and object detection models. Results supported the promise of this monitoring approach, which could optimize behavioral research on screen exposure in children's naturalistic settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss learning algorithms and their importance in different types of applications which includes training to identify important patterns and features in a straightforward, easy-to-understand manner. We will review the main concepts of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid models. Some important subsets of Machine Learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning are also discussed in this paper. These techniques can be used for some important tasks like prediction, classification, and segmentation. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used for image and video processing and many more applications. We dive into the architecture of CNNs and how to integrate CNNs with ML algorithms to build hybrid models. This paper explores the vulnerability of learning algorithms to noise, leading to misclassification. We further discuss the integration of learning algorithms with Large Language Models (LLM) to generate coherent responses applicable to many domains such as healthcare, marketing, and finance by learning important patterns from large volumes of data. Furthermore, we discuss the next generation of learning algorithms and how we may have an unified Adaptive and Dynamic Network to perform important tasks. Overall, this article provides brief overview of learning algorithms, exploring their current state, applications and future direction.

Abstract: Reduced voltage operation is an effective technique for substantial energy efficiency improvement in digital circuits. This brief introduces a simple approach for enabling reduced voltage operation of Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerators by mere software modifications. Conventional approaches for enabling reduced voltage operation e.g., Timing Error Detection (TED) systems, incur significant development costs and overheads, while not being applicable to the off-the-shelf components. Contrary to those, the solution proposed in this paper relies on algorithm-based error detection, and hence, is implemented with low development costs, does not require any circuit modifications, and is even applicable to commodity devices. By showcasing the solution through experimenting on popular DNNs, i.e., LeNet and VGG16, on a GPU platform, we demonstrate 18% to 25% energy saving with no accuracy loss of the models and negligible throughput compromise (< 3.9%), considering the overheads from integration of the error detection schemes into the DNN. The integration of presented algorithmic solution into the design is simpler when compared conventional TED based techniques that require extensive circuit-level modifications, cell library characterizations or special support from the design tools.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate exceptional performance in simple code generation tasks but still face challenges in tackling complex problems. These challenges may stem from insufficient reasoning and problem decomposition capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a reasoning-augmented data generation process, SRA-MCTS, which guides the model to autonomously generate high-quality intermediate reasoning paths. This creates a positive feedback loop, enabling continuous improvement. Our method operates entirely through the model itself without requiring additional supervision. By synthesizing natural language reasoning paths and translating them into executable code, the approach ensures analytical accuracy and enhances the success rate in solving complex tasks. Experimental results show that, even without additional supervisory signals, our method achieves performance improvements across different model scales, demonstrating the significant potential of self-improvement in small models. Furthermore, the method remains robust when traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches exhibit performance degradation, with notable improvements observed in diversity metrics such as pass@10. We encourage further exploration of reasoning processes within training data to enhance the ability of language models to address complex problems.

<title>VladVA: Discriminative Fine-tuning of LVLMs</title>

Abstract: Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have become the de facto approach for discriminative vision-language representation learning. However, these models have limited language understanding, often exhibiting a "bag of words" behavior. At the same time, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which combine vision encoders with LLMs, have been shown to be capable of detailed vision-language reasoning, yet their autoregressive nature renders them less suitable for discriminative tasks.
  In this work, we propose to combine "the best of both worlds": a new training approach for discriminative fine-tuning of LVLMs that results in strong discriminative and compositional capabilities. Essentially, our approach converts a generative LVLM into a discriminative one, unlocking its capability for powerful image-text discrimination combined with enhanced language understanding.
  Our contributions include (1) a carefully designed training/optimization framework that utilizes image-text pairs of variable length and granularity for training the model with both contrastive and next-token prediction losses. This is accompanied by ablation studies that justify the necessity of our framework's components; (2) a parameter-efficient adaptation method using a combination of soft prompting and LoRA adapters; (3) significant improvements over state-of-the-art CLIP-like models of similar size, including standard image-text retrieval benchmarks and notable gains in compositionality.

<title>From Models to Network Topologies: A Topology Inference Attack in Decentralized Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is widely recognized as a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm due to its model-sharing mechanism that avoids direct data exchange. Nevertheless, model training leaves exploitable traces that can be used to infer sensitive information. In Decentralized FL (DFL), the topology, defining how participants are connected, plays a crucial role in shaping the model's privacy, robustness, and convergence. However, the topology introduces an unexplored vulnerability: attackers can exploit it to infer participant relationships and launch targeted attacks. This work uncovers the hidden risks of DFL topologies by proposing a novel Topology Inference Attack that infers the topology solely from model behavior. A taxonomy of topology inference attacks is introduced, categorizing them by the attacker's capabilities and knowledge. Practical attack strategies are designed for various scenarios, and experiments are conducted to identify key factors influencing attack success. The results demonstrate that analyzing only the model of each node can accurately infer the DFL topology, highlighting a critical privacy risk in DFL systems. These findings offer valuable insights for improving privacy preservation in DFL environments.

<title>Can open source large language models be used for tumor documentation in Germany? -- An evaluation on urological doctors' notes</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12106</link>

arXiv:2501.12106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tumor documentation in Germany is largely done manually, requiring reading patient records and entering data into structured databases. Large language models (LLMs) could potentially enhance this process by improving efficiency and reliability. This evaluation tests eleven different open source LLMs with sizes ranging from 1-70 billion model parameters on three basic tasks of the tumor documentation process: identifying tumor diagnoses, assigning ICD-10 codes, and extracting the date of first diagnosis. For evaluating the LLMs on these tasks, a dataset of annotated text snippets based on anonymized doctors' notes from urology was prepared. Different prompting strategies were used to investigate the effect of the number of examples in few-shot prompting and to explore the capabilities of the LLMs in general. The models Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Mistral NeMo 12 B performed comparably well in the tasks. Models with less extensive training data or having fewer than 7 billion parameters showed notably lower performance, while larger models did not display performance gains. Examples from a different medical domain than urology could also improve the outcome in few-shot prompting, which demonstrates the ability of LLMs to handle tasks needed for tumor documentation. Open source LLMs show a strong potential for automating tumor documentation. Models from 7-12 billion parameters could offer an optimal balance between performance and resource efficiency. With tailored fine-tuning and well-designed prompting, these models might become important tools for clinical documentation in the future. The code for the evaluation is available from https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/UroLlmEval. We also release the dataset as a new valuable resource that addresses the shortage of authentic and easily accessible benchmarks in German-language medical NLP.

Abstract: Rotation equivariant graph neural networks, i.e. networks designed to guarantee certain geometric relations between their inputs and outputs, yield state of the art performance on spatial deep learning tasks. They exhibit high data efficiency during training and significantly reduced inference time for interatomic potential calculations compared to classical approaches. Key to these models is the Clebsch-Gordon (CG) tensor product, a kernel that contracts two dense feature vectors with a highly-structured sparse tensor to produce a dense output vector. The operation, which may be repeated millions of times for typical equivariant models, is a costly and inefficient bottleneck. We introduce a GPU sparse kernel generator for the CG tensor product that provides significant speedups over the best existing open and closed-source implementations. Our implementation achieves high performance by carefully managing the limited GPU shared memory through static analysis at model compile-time, minimizing reads and writes to global memory. We break the tensor product into a series of smaller kernels with operands that fit entirely into registers, enabling us to emit long arithmetic instruction streams that maximize instruction-level parallelism. By fusing the CG tensor product with a subsequent graph convolution, we reduce both intermediate storage and global memory traffic over naive approaches that duplicate input data. We also provide optimized kernels for the gradient of the CG tensor product and a novel identity for the higher partial derivatives required to predict interatomic forces. Our kernels offer up to 1.3x speedup over NVIDIA's closed-source cuEquivariance package, as well as 10x speedup over the widely-used e3nn package. In FP64 precision, we offer up to 6.2x inference-time speedup for the MACE chemistry foundation model over the original unoptimized version.

<title>JustLogic: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Deductive Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2501.14851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logical reasoning is a critical component of Large Language Models (LLMs), and substantial research efforts in recent years have aimed to enhance their deductive reasoning capabilities. However, existing deductive reasoning benchmarks, which are crucial for evaluating and advancing LLMs, are inadequate due to their lack of task complexity, presence of prior knowledge as a confounder, and superficial error analysis. To address these deficiencies, we introduce JustLogic, a synthetically generated deductive reasoning benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of LLMs. JustLogic is (i) highly complex, capable of generating a diverse range of linguistic patterns, vocabulary, and argument structures; (ii) prior knowledge independent, eliminating the advantage of models possessing prior knowledge and ensuring that only deductive reasoning is used to answer questions; and (iii) capable of in-depth error analysis on the heterogeneous effects of reasoning depth and argument form on model accuracy. Our experimental results on JustLogic reveal that (i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning LLMs perform on par or better than the human average but significantly worse than the human ceiling, and (ii) SOTA non-reasoning models still underperform the human average. All code and data are available at https://github.com/michaelchen-lab/JustLogic

Abstract: Large language models have shown impressive multilingual capabilities through pretraining on diverse corpora. While these models show strong reasoning abilities, their performance varies significantly across languages due to imbalanced training data distribution. Existing approaches using sample-level translation for extensive multilingual pretraining and cross-lingual tuning face scalability challenges and often fail to capture nuanced reasoning processes across languages. In this paper, we introduce AdaCoT (Adaptive Chain-of-Thought), a framework that enhances multilingual factual reasoning by dynamically routing thought processes in intermediary ``thinking languages'' before generating target-language responses. AdaCoT leverages a language-agnostic core and incorporates an adaptive, reward-based mechanism for selecting optimal reasoning pathways without requiring additional pretraining. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates substantial improvements in both factual reasoning quality and cross-lingual consistency, with particularly strong performance gains in low-resource language settings. The results suggest that adaptive reasoning paths can effectively bridge the performance gap between high and low-resource languages while maintaining cultural and linguistic nuances.

<title>Generalized Class Discovery in Instance Segmentation</title>

Abstract: This work addresses the task of generalized class discovery (GCD) in instance segmentation. The goal is to discover novel classes and obtain a model capable of segmenting instances of both known and novel categories, given labeled and unlabeled data. Since the real world contains numerous objects with long-tailed distributions, the instance distribution for each class is inherently imbalanced. To address the imbalanced distributions, we propose an instance-wise temperature assignment (ITA) method for contrastive learning and class-wise reliability criteria for pseudo-labels. The ITA method relaxes instance discrimination for samples belonging to head classes to enhance GCD. The reliability criteria are to avoid excluding most pseudo-labels for tail classes when training an instance segmentation network using pseudo-labels from GCD. Additionally, we propose dynamically adjusting the criteria to leverage diverse samples in the early stages while relying only on reliable pseudo-labels in the later stages. We also introduce an efficient soft attention module to encode object-specific representations for GCD. Finally, we evaluate our proposed method by conducting experiments on two settings: COCO$_{half}$ + LVIS and LVIS + Visual Genome. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Evolutionary model merging enables the creation of high-performing multi-task models but remains computationally prohibitive for consumer hardware. We introduce MERGE$^3$, an efficient framework that makes evolutionary merging feasible on a single GPU by reducing fitness computation costs 50$\times$ while preserving performance. MERGE$^3$ achieves this by Extracting a reduced dataset for evaluation, Estimating model abilities using Item Response Theory (IRT), and Evolving optimal merges via IRT-based performance estimators. Our method enables state-of-the-art multilingual and cross-lingual merging, transferring knowledge across languages with significantly lower computational overhead. We provide theoretical guarantees and an open-source library, democratizing high-quality model merging.

Abstract: Agentic Generative AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Vector Stores (VSs), represents a transformative technology applicable to specialized domains such as legal systems, research, recommender systems, cybersecurity, and global security, including proliferation research. This technology excels at inferring relationships within vast unstructured or semi-structured datasets. The legal domain here comprises complex data characterized by extensive, interrelated, and semi-structured knowledge systems with complex relations. It comprises constitutions, statutes, regulations, and case law. Extracting insights and navigating the intricate networks of legal documents and their relations is crucial for effective legal research. Here, we introduce a generative AI system that integrates RAG, VS, and KG, constructed via Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to enhance legal information retrieval and AI reasoning and minimize hallucinations. In the legal system, these technologies empower AI agents to identify and analyze complex connections among cases, statutes, and legal precedents, uncovering hidden relationships and predicting legal trends-challenging tasks that are essential for ensuring justice and improving operational efficiency. Our system employs web scraping techniques to systematically collect legal texts, such as statutes, constitutional provisions, and case law, from publicly accessible platforms like Justia. It bridges the gap between traditional keyword-based searches and contextual understanding by leveraging advanced semantic representations, hierarchical relationships, and latent topic discovery. This framework supports legal document clustering, summarization, and cross-referencing, for scalable, interpretable, and accurate retrieval for semi-structured data while advancing computational law and AI.

Abstract: Data privacy remains a critical concern in educational research, requiring strict adherence to ethical standards and regulatory protocols. While traditional approaches rely on anonymization and centralized data collection, they often expose raw student data to security vulnerabilities and impose substantial logistical overhead. In this study, we propose a federated learning (FL) framework for automated scoring of educational assessments that eliminates the need to share sensitive data across institutions. Our approach leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enabling each client (school) to train locally while sharing only optimized model updates. To address data heterogeneity, we implement an adaptive weighted aggregation strategy that considers both client performance and data volume. We benchmark our model against two state-of-the-art FL methods and a centralized learning baseline using NGSS-aligned multi-label science assessment data from nine middle schools. Results show that our model achieves the highest accuracy (94.5%) among FL approaches, and performs within 0.5-1.0 percentage points of the centralized model on these metrics. Additionally, it achieves comparable rubric-level scoring accuracy, with only a 1.3% difference in rubric match and a lower score deviation (MAE), highlighting its effectiveness in preserving both prediction quality and interpretability.

Abstract: The internet is undergoing a historical transformation from the "Internet of Websites" to the "Internet of AgentSites." While traditional Websites served as the foundation for information hosting and dissemination, a new frontier is emerging where AgentSites serve as the hubs of the internet, where each AgentSite hosts one or more AI agents that receive tasks, address them, and deliver actionable solutions, marking a significant shift in the digital landscape and representing the next generation of online ecosystems. Under this vision, AIOS, the AI Agent Operating System, serves as the server for the development, deployment and execution of AI agents, which is a fundamental infrastructure for the Internet of Agentsites.
  In this paper, we introduce AIOS Server, a runtime framework to host agents and enable global-scale collaboration among decentralized agents. AIOS Server provides a communication protocol leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and JSON-RPC to enable agent-agent or human-agent interactions. Each AIOS node operates as a server to host and execute agents, while supporting peer-to-peer coordination without reliance on centralized orchestration. Based on AIOS Server, we further present the world's first practically deployed Internet of Agentsites (AIOS-IoA), including AgentHub for agent registration and discovery and AgentChat for interactive communication, at https://planet.aios.foundation. The agent discovery mechanism based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) and a Gossip protocol serves as the search engine for the internet of agentsites. This work provides a practical foundation for building the Internet of Agentsites-a new paradigm where autonomous agents become first-class citizens of the web. The implementation is available at https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS.Server and is integrated into the AIOS main branch at https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS.

<div> Keywords: cognitive architecture, belief states, epistemic agents, Null Tower, structured interpretability  

<br /><br />Summary: This monograph introduces a modular cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence, rooted in the formal modeling of belief as structured semantic states. It conceptualizes belief states as dynamic ensembles of linguistic expressions situated within a navigable manifold, facilitated by operators that allow for various cognitive processes such as assimilation and introspection. The framework, which integrates insights from philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience, aims to create self-regulating epistemic agents capable of reflective and goal-oriented thought. Central to this architecture is the "epistemic vacuum," defining a set of semantically inert cognitive states that form the basis of belief space. From this theoretical backdrop, the "Null Tower" is proposed—a generative structure constructed recursively through internal representational abilities. The constructs are intended for implementation in both symbolic and neural systems, extending to large language models, hybrid agents, and adaptive memory architectures. Ultimately, this work lays a foundational substrate for developing agents that can reason, remember, and manage their beliefs in a structured and interpretable manner. <div>

Abstract: This monograph presents a modular cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence grounded in the formal modeling of belief as structured semantic state. Belief states are defined as dynamic ensembles of linguistic expressions embedded within a navigable manifold, where operators enable assimilation, abstraction, nullification, memory, and introspection. Drawing from philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we develop a layered framework that enables self-regulating epistemic agents capable of reflective, goal-directed thought. At the core of this framework is the epistemic vacuum: a class of semantically inert cognitive states that serves as the conceptual origin of belief space. From this foundation, the Null Tower arises as a generative structure recursively built through internal representational capacities. The theoretical constructs are designed to be implementable in both symbolic and neural systems, including large language models, hybrid agents, and adaptive memory architectures. This work offers a foundational substrate for constructing agents that reason, remember, and regulate their beliefs in structured, interpretable ways.

<br /><br />Summary: The article discusses the importance of effective data visualization, emphasizing that it requires both technical skills and an understanding of the specific context of the data. This context often includes implicit knowledge regarding data provenance, quality, and intended use, which is not typically documented within datasets. To address this challenge, the authors present the Data Therapist, a web-based tool designed to assist domain experts in articulating this tacit knowledge. The tool employs a mixed-initiative approach, combining iterative Q&amp;A with interactive annotation. It leverages a large language model to analyze user-supplied datasets, prompting users with targeted questions and enabling annotation at different levels of detail. The output is a structured knowledge base that can guide both human and automated visualization design. The effectiveness of the Data Therapist was evaluated in a qualitative study involving expert pairs from diverse fields including Molecular Biology, Accounting, Political Science, and Usable Security. The findings revealed consistent patterns in how these experts reason about their data and identified opportunities where AI support could enhance visualization design, ultimately contributing to better data representation and understanding. <div>

Abstract: Effective data visualization requires not only technical proficiency but also a deep understanding of the domain-specific context in which data exists. This context often includes tacit knowledge about data provenance, quality, and intended use, which is rarely explicit in the dataset itself. We present the Data Therapist, a web-based tool that helps domain experts externalize this implicit knowledge through a mixed-initiative process combining iterative Q&amp;A with interactive annotation. Powered by a large language model, the system analyzes user-supplied datasets, prompts users with targeted questions, and allows annotation at varying levels of granularity. The resulting structured knowledge base can inform both human and automated visualization design. We evaluated the tool in a qualitative study involving expert pairs from Molecular Biology, Accounting, Political Science, and Usable Security. The study revealed recurring patterns in how experts reason about their data and highlights areas where AI support can improve visualization design.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, understanding, dialogues, thought experiment, ambiguity barrier

<br /><br />Summary: The paper discusses the ongoing debate surrounding the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding the world and engaging in meaningful dialogue. It highlights the various arguments presented, including thought experiments, anecdotal evidence, and statistical analyses, that explore the nature of LLMs' understanding. The authors pose a counter-argument based on a thought experiment which suggests that there exists an inherent ambiguity barrier. This barrier, they argue, fundamentally limits LLMs' ability to truly comprehend the meanings behind their fluent dialogues. The authors contend that despite the impressive performance of LLMs in generating human-like text, they lack a genuine understanding of the content they produce. By presenting semi-formal considerations, the authors aim to reinforce the notion that LLMs do not grasp the significance of their interactions and statements, even if they appear linguistically adept. This exploration emphasizes the philosophical challenges in distinguishing between mere linguistic fluency and true understanding, raising important questions about the implications of AI in conversation and cognition. The discussion encourages further reflection on the capabilities and limitations of LLMs as they relate to human-like understanding. <div>

Arguments and counter-arguments have been proposed based upon thought experiments, anecdotal conversations between LLMs and humans, statistical linguistic analysis, philosophical considerations, and more. In this brief paper we present a counter-argument based upon a thought experiment and semi-formal considerations leading to an inherent ambiguity barrier which prevents LLMs from having any understanding of what their amazingly fluent dialogues mean.

Furthermore, we improve model performance through targeted prompt engineering and fine-tuning strategies for summarizing research papers, and apply test-time computational scaling to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LMMs, achieving superior accuracy compared to human-expert corrections. We also explore the potential of using LMM Agents to generate scientific hypotheses from diverse multimodal inputs. Overall, our results delineate clear strengths and highlight significant limitations of current foundation models, providing actionable insights and guiding future advancements in deploying large-scale language and multi-modal models within biomedical research.

<div> Keywords: autonomy, agency, computational irreducibility, undecidability, algorithmic information theory  

<br /><br />Summary: This article examines the emergence of autonomy and agency by linking fundamental computational limits with physical concepts. It introduces a formal model of a "minimal agent" in potentially Turing-complete environments. Using algorithmic information theory, the authors argue that the undecidability and computational irreducibility of how agents interact with their environments lead to unpredictability and the generation of new information, which enables agency as effective goal-directed action. The article asserts that computational irreducibility hinders full external prediction, thereby creating conditions necessary for autonomous behavior. It explores the concept of computational sourcehood, where an agent serves as the irreducible source of its actions, though formalizing this remains complex. The central thesis, proven within the work, is that genuine autonomy must imply undecidability from an external perspective, thus differentiating autonomous systems from those that are predictable. The authors propose that agency emerges when the complexity of agent-environment interactions enhances mutual information between an agent's internal states and relevant environmental variables, especially in the absence of analytical solutions. This framework connects agency to these computational interaction properties, suggesting implications for understanding consciousness, autonomous AI development, and free will in a deterministic, yet computationally irreducible universe. <div>

Abstract: This article explores the emergence of autonomy and agency by connecting fundamental computational limits (decidability, completeness, computational irreducibility) with physical concepts. We introduce a formal model of a "minimal agent" operating within potentially Turing-complete environments. Using algorithmic information theory, we argue that the inherent undecidability and computational irreducibility of agent-environment interaction lead to unpredictability and novel information generation, enabling agency (effective goal-directed action). Computational irreducibility prevents full external prediction, creating necessary conditions for autonomous behavior. We relate this to computational sourcehood, where an agent is the irreducible origin of its behavior, though formalizing this concept remains challenging. Our central thesis, formally proven, is that genuine autonomy necessarily implies undecidability from an external perspective, distinguishing autonomous systems from predictable ones. We propose that agency arises when agent-environment coupling complexity allows mutual information between internal states and relevant environmental variables to increase, particularly where analytical solutions are absent and operational closure is needed for persistence. This framework links agency directly to the computational properties of interaction, offering implications for understanding consciousness, designing autonomous AI, and reconceptualizing free will in a deterministic yet computationally irreducible universe.

<div> Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Maximum Weighted Independent Set, Intelligent Transportation Systems, DynLS, Heuristic Algorithms  

<br /><br />Summary: This article introduces a novel algorithm called DynLS to solve the NP-hard Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem, which is relevant for various Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications like traffic signal control. The algorithm is designed to address the high computational resource requirements and long training times typically associated with AI techniques in large-scale scenarios. DynLS includes three innovations: a scores-based adaptive vertex perturbation (SAVP) technique that accelerates convergence, a region location mechanism (RLM) that helps escape local optima by dynamically adjusting the search space, and a variable neighborhood descent strategy, ComLS, which utilizes vertex exchange and a reward system to guide the search for quality solutions. Experimental results show that DynLS consistently outperforms five leading algorithms across 360 test instances, achieving the best solution in 350 of those instances. It also matches the convergence speed of the second-best algorithm, Cyclic-Fast, while surpassing it in overall performance. This research marks a significant advancement in heuristic approaches to the MWIS problem and provides a promising method for optimizing ITS using AI techniques. <div>

Abstract: While Artificial intelligence (AI), including Generative AI, are effective at generating high-quality traffic data and optimization solutions in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), these techniques often demand significant training time and computational resources, especially in large-scale and complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce a novel and efficient algorithm for solving the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem, which can be used to model many ITSs applications, such as traffic signal control and vehicle routing. Given the NP-hard nature of the MWIS problem, our proposed algorithm, DynLS, incorporates three key innovations to solve it effectively. First, it uses a scores-based adaptive vertex perturbation (SAVP) technique to accelerate convergence, particularly in sparse graphs. Second, it includes a region location mechanism (RLM) to help escape local optima by dynamically adjusting the search space. Finally, it employs a novel variable neighborhood descent strategy, ComLS, which combines vertex exchange strategies with a reward mechanism to guide the search toward high-quality solutions. Our experimental results demonstrate DynLS's superior performance, consistently delivering high-quality solutions within 1000 seconds. DynLS outperformed five leading algorithms across 360 test instances, achieving the best solution for 350 instances and surpassing the second-best algorithm, Cyclic-Fast, by 177 instances. Moreover, DynLS matched Cyclic-Fast's convergence speed, highlighting its efficiency and practicality. This research represents a significant advancement in heuristic algorithms for the MWIS problem, offering a promising approach to aid AI techniques in optimizing intelligent transportation systems.

<div> Keywords: intelligent tutoring systems, large language models, propositional logic, accuracy, personalized feedback  

<br /><br />Summary: Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) have proven effective in teaching formal propositional logic proofs, yet they are limited by template-based explanations that hinder personalized student feedback. Large language models (LLMs) present a potential solution for generating dynamic feedback but face challenges like hallucinations and providing pedagogy-sound explanations. In this study, the authors evaluated the stepwise accuracy of various LLMs in constructing multi-step symbolic logic proofs, analyzing six prompting techniques across four advanced LLMs on 358 logic problems. The DeepSeek-V3 model outperformed others with an 84.4% accuracy rate, especially on simpler rules. The best-performing LLM was further utilized to generate hints for 1,050 unique problem-solving states from a logic ITS, which were assessed based on four criteria using both an LLM grader and human expert evaluations on a 20% sample. The analysis revealed that LLM-generated hints were 75% accurate and received high ratings from humans for consistency and clarity. However, they fell short in adequately explaining the rationale behind the hints and their broader context. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs can enhance logic tutoring systems with hints but require modifications for improved accuracy and educational relevance. <div>

Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems have demonstrated effectiveness in teaching formal propositional logic proofs, but their reliance on template-based explanations limits their ability to provide personalized student feedback. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for dynamic feedback generation, they risk producing hallucinations or pedagogically unsound explanations. We evaluated the stepwise accuracy of LLMs in constructing multi-step symbolic logic proofs, comparing six prompting techniques across four state-of-the-art LLMs on 358 propositional logic problems. Results show that DeepSeek-V3 achieved superior performance with 84.4% accuracy on stepwise proof construction and excelled particularly in simpler rules. We further used the best-performing LLM to generate explanatory hints for 1,050 unique student problem-solving states from a logic ITS and evaluated them on 4 criteria with both an LLM grader and human expert ratings on a 20% sample. Our analysis finds that LLM-generated hints were 75% accurate and rated highly by human evaluators on consistency and clarity, but did not perform as well explaining why the hint was provided or its larger context. Our results demonstrate that LLMs may be used to augment tutoring systems with logic tutoring hints, but requires additional modifications to ensure accuracy and pedagogical appropriateness.

<title>Is there Value in Reinforcement Learning?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04822</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04822</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: action-values, reinforcement learning, policy-gradient, modeling assumptions, computational complexity

<br /><br />Summary: Action-values are crucial in reinforcement learning (RL) models, yet their explicit representation has sparked extensive debate. Critics advocate for policy-gradient (PG) methods over value-based (VB) approaches, viewing the latter as flawed. However, this preference is misguided as PG methods are not "Value-free"; they require a representation of Value for learning even if not for acting. The reliance on Value arises from fundamental assumptions in the standard RL framework, not merely the choice of algorithm. Previous studies often overlook these assumptions while debating optimization strategies, such as PG versus VB methods. The authors argue the need to reassess these foundational modeling assumptions, particularly in experimental contexts. Relaxing standard assumptions like risk neutrality and full observability can alter the understanding of Value, which is critical in natural settings. Additionally, the authors advocate for a more nuanced understanding of what constitutes "a model" in cognitive sciences, proposing that model complexity should incorporate both statistical and computational complexities, rather than focusing solely on parametric statistical complexity. Thus, fostering a broader perspective on modeling within cognitive science is essential for addressing these ongoing debates. <div>
arXiv:2505.04822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Action-values play a central role in popular Reinforcement Learing (RL) models of behavior. Yet, the idea that action-values are explicitly represented has been extensively debated. Critics had therefore repeatedly suggested that policy-gradient (PG) models should be favored over value-based (VB) ones, as a potential solution for this dilemma. Here we argue that this solution is unsatisfying. This is because PG methods are not, in fact, "Value-free" -- while they do not rely on an explicit representation of Value for acting (stimulus-response mapping), they do require it for learning. Hence, switching to PG models is, per se, insufficient for eliminating Value from models of behavior. More broadly, the requirement for a representation of Value stems from the underlying assumptions regarding the optimization objective posed by the standard RL framework, not from the particular algorithm chosen to solve it. Previous studies mostly took these standard RL assumptions for granted, as part of their conceptualization or problem modeling, while debating the different methods used to optimize it (i.e., PG or VB). We propose that, instead, the focus of the debate should shift to critically evaluating the underlying modeling assumptions. Such evaluation is particularly important from an experimental perspective. Indeed, the very notion of Value must be reconsidered when standard assumptions (e.g., risk neutrality, full-observability, Markovian environment, exponential discounting) are relaxed, as is likely in natural settings. Finally, we use the Value debate as a case study to argue in favor of a more nuanced, algorithmic rather than statistical, view of what constitutes "a model" in cognitive sciences. Our analysis suggests that besides "parametric" statistical complexity, additional aspects such as computational complexity must also be taken into account when evaluating model complexity.

<div> Keywords: Autonomous Cyber Defense, Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning, multi-agent scenarios, communication protocol  

<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the importance of fast and effective incident response in cybersecurity through Autonomous Cyber Defense (ACD), which utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for planning and executing responses to cyberattacks. While traditional ACD methods often focus on single-agent environments and use Reinforcement Learning (RL), they exhibit high training costs and lack explainability. To overcome these issues, the study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for ACD, although existing research has yet to evaluate their performance in multi-agent interactions. The authors present their first study on LLMs within multi-agent ACD environments, specifically through a new integration with the CybORG CAGE 4 framework. They propose a novel communication protocol to facilitate interaction between teams of LLM and RL agents. The results of this study outline the strengths and weaknesses of both agent types, offering valuable insights and identifying promising directions for future research on the creation, training, and deployment of ACD teams. This pioneering work aims to enhance the effectiveness of automated cyber defense strategies in increasingly complex environments. <div>

Abstract: Fast and effective incident response is essential to prevent adversarial cyberattacks. Autonomous Cyber Defense (ACD) aims to automate incident response through Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents that plan and execute actions. Most ACD approaches focus on single-agent scenarios and leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, ACD RL-trained agents depend on costly training, and their reasoning is not always explainable or transferable. Large Language Models (LLMs) can address these concerns by providing explainable actions in general security contexts. Researchers have explored LLM agents for ACD but have not evaluated them on multi-agent scenarios or interacting with other ACD agents. In this paper, we show the first study on how LLMs perform in multi-agent ACD environments by proposing a new integration to the CybORG CAGE 4 environment. We examine how ACD teams of LLM and RL agents can interact by proposing a novel communication protocol. Our results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs and RL and help us identify promising research directions to create, train, and deploy future teams of ACD agents.

<div> Keywords: text-to-image generation, cultural adaptation, dataset, Russian culture, Kandinsky 3.1  

<br /><br />Summary: The article addresses the significant cultural knowledge gaps in popular text-to-image generation models, which primarily rely on training datasets rooted in Western European or American cultures. These gaps can result in the production of inaccurate outputs, reduced generation quality, and the perpetuation of stereotypes and offensive content. In response to this issue, the authors emphasize the importance of understanding cultural codes for improving image generation models. They propose a methodology for collecting and processing data to create a dataset centered on the Russian cultural code. The research explores how the incorporation of this data enhances generation quality within the national context. To evaluate the effectiveness of their approach, the authors conduct tests using the Kandinsky 3.1 text-to-image model. Results from human evaluations indicate a notable increase in the model's awareness of Russian culture. Overall, the study highlights the necessity for cultural adaptation in AI models, as it is essential for generating relevant and accurate content across diverse cultural landscapes. <div>
arXiv:2505.04851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the fact that popular text-to-image generation models cope well with international and general cultural queries, they have a significant knowledge gap regarding individual cultures. This is due to the content of existing large training datasets collected on the Internet, which are predominantly based on Western European or American popular culture. Meanwhile, the lack of cultural adaptation of the model can lead to incorrect results, a decrease in the generation quality, and the spread of stereotypes and offensive content. In an effort to address this issue, we examine the concept of cultural code and recognize the critical importance of its understanding by modern image generation models, an issue that has not been sufficiently addressed in the research community to date. We propose the methodology for collecting and processing the data necessary to form a dataset based on the cultural code, in particular the Russian one. We explore how the collected data affects the quality of generations in the national domain and analyze the effectiveness of our approach using the Kandinsky 3.1 text-to-image model. Human evaluation results demonstrate an increase in the level of awareness of Russian culture in the model.

<div> Keywords: Transformer-decoder, language models, reasoning, architectural constraints, enigme  

<br /><br />Summary: This article discusses the significance of transformer-decoder language models in generative artificial intelligence, highlighting their role in understanding natural language commands and applying reasoning to various tasks. The authors emphasize the importance of recognizing the limitations of these models by examining their architectural constraints. They assert that the latent variable structures within transformer-decoder models should be taken into account when assessing their reasoning capabilities. To facilitate this examination, they introduce "enigme," an open-source library specifically designed for generating text-based puzzles. This library aims to serve as a tool for training and evaluating the reasoning skills of transformer-decoder models and potentially other future AI architectures. By designing reasoning tasks that explore the boundaries of these models' capacities, the authors aim to deepen the understanding of how effectively these systems can reason and adapt to novel challenges. Ultimately, this work seeks to provide insights into the design of more capable AI systems through rigorous evaluation methods. <div>
arXiv:2505.04914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-decoder language models are a core innovation in text based generative artificial intelligence. These models are being deployed as general-purpose intelligence systems in many applications. Central to their utility is the capacity to understand natural language commands and exploit the reasoning embedded in human text corpora to apply some form of reasoning process to a wide variety of novel tasks. To understand the limitations of this approach to generating reasoning we argue that we need to consider the architectural constraints of these systems. Consideration of the latent variable structure of transformer-decoder models allows us to design reasoning tasks that should probe the boundary of their capacity to reason. We present enigme, an open-source library for generating text-based puzzles to be used in training and evaluating reasoning skills within transformer-decoder models and future AI architectures.

<div> Keywords: belief filtering, artificial agents, Semantic Manifold, AI safety, cognitive governance  

<br /><br />Summary: This paper explores belief filtering as a method for managing the cognitive states of artificial agents, emphasizing control over internal representations via linguistic expressions. The concept is situated within the Semantic Manifold framework, where belief states are dynamic structures composed of natural language fragments. The authors introduce belief filters as content-aware operations that optimize these fragments during cognitive transitions. A key feature of this approach is its inherent interpretability and modularity, which stem from the linguistically-based cognitive architecture, enabling effective belief filtering. The study illustrates how structured interventions in an agent's internal semantic space can enhance AI safety and promote alignment with human values. By providing a principled way to regulate an agent's beliefs, this research opens new avenues for architecturally embedded cognitive governance, ultimately suggesting that better management of cognitive states can lead to safer interactions between artificial agents and humans. <div>

Abstract: We examine belief filtering as a mechanism for the epistemic control of artificial agents, focusing on the regulation of internal cognitive states represented as linguistic expressions. This mechanism is developed within the Semantic Manifold framework, where belief states are dynamic, structured ensembles of natural language fragments. Belief filters act as content-aware operations on these fragments across various cognitive transitions. This paper illustrates how the inherent interpretability and modularity of such a linguistically-grounded cognitive architecture directly enable belief filtering, offering a principled approach to agent regulation. The study highlights the potential for enhancing AI safety and alignment through structured interventions in an agent's internal semantic space and points to new directions for architecturally embedded cognitive governance.

<div> Keywords: AI, uncertainty, generalization, autonomous systems, epistemic artificial intelligence

<br /><br />Summary: The paper addresses the limitations of current AI systems, particularly in managing uncertainty and generalizing beyond their training data. Despite advancements in generative models and large language models, AI models, particularly in autonomous systems, struggle to make reliable predictions when faced with unfamiliar or adversarial scenarios—evident from various incidents involving autonomous vehicles. Traditional machine learning methods often emphasize data fitting and domain adaptation, which fail to adequately tackle these challenges. The authors propose a paradigm shift towards "epistemic artificial intelligence," which emphasizes the importance of recognizing and managing uncertainty. This approach advocates for models that learn not only from existing knowledge but also from their limitations and unrecognized gaps. By fostering such capabilities, AI systems could enhance their robustness and resilience, thereby improving their performance in unpredictable real-world environments. The paper asserts that adopting this new perspective may provide viable solutions to the pressing issues of reliability and adaptability in AI technologies, ultimately leading to safer and more capable autonomous systems. <div>

Abstract: Despite the impressive achievements of AI, including advancements in generative models and large language models, there remains a significant gap in the ability of AI to handle uncertainty and generalize beyond the training data.

Traditional machine learning approaches struggle to address these issues due to an overemphasis on data fitting and domain adaptation. This position paper posits a paradigm shift towards epistemic artificial intelligence, emphasizing the need for models to learn not only from what they know but also from their ignorance. This approach, which focuses on recognizing and managing uncertainty, offers a potential solution to improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems, ensuring that they can better handle unpredictable real-world environments.

<div> Keywords: peer review, artificial intelligence, accountability, author evaluation, reviewer rewards

<br /><br />Summary: The peer review process in major AI conferences is facing significant challenges due to a surge in paper submissions, resulting in concerns about review quality and reviewer accountability. This position paper advocates for transforming the traditional one-way review system into a bi-directional feedback loop that emphasizes mutual responsibility among authors, reviewers, and conference organizers. It argues for the creation of an accountability framework that promotes sustainable, high-quality peer review. The authors emphasize that while the issues involving authors require policy enforcement and detection, ethical concerns must be addressed through self-reflection. The paper highlights two proposed mechanisms for enhancing reviewer accountability: (1) implementing a two-stage bi-directional review system that allows authors to evaluate the quality of reviews while reducing the risk of retaliatory behavior, and (2) establishing a systematic rewards program that incentivizes quality reviewing. The authors call for increased community engagement and interest in reforming the peer review process to address these pressing concerns and improve its overall effectiveness. <div>

Abstract: The peer review process in major artificial intelligence (AI) conferences faces unprecedented challenges with the surge of paper submissions (exceeding 10,000 submissions per venue), accompanied by growing concerns over review quality and reviewer responsibility. This position paper argues for the need to transform the traditional one-way review system into a bi-directional feedback loop where authors evaluate review quality and reviewers earn formal accreditation, creating an accountability framework that promotes a sustainable, high-quality peer review system. The current review system can be viewed as an interaction between three parties: the authors, reviewers, and system (i.e., conference), where we posit that all three parties share responsibility for the current problems. However, issues with authors can only be addressed through policy enforcement and detection tools, and ethical concerns can only be corrected through self-reflection. As such, this paper focuses on reforming reviewer accountability with systematic rewards through two key mechanisms: (1) a two-stage bi-directional review system that allows authors to evaluate reviews while minimizing retaliatory behavior, (2)a systematic reviewer reward system that incentivizes quality reviewing. We ask for the community's strong interest in these problems and the reforms that are needed to enhance the peer review process.

<br /><br />Summary: 
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a vital simulation tool in engineering, but it often demands significant domain expertise and manual configuration, posing challenges for users. To address this issue, we introduce Foam-Agent, a multi-agent framework that automates complex OpenFOAM-based CFD simulation workflows using natural language inputs. Key innovations include a hierarchical multi-index retrieval system tailored to various simulation aspects, and a dependency-aware file generation system that ensures consistency across configuration files. Additionally, Foam-Agent features an iterative error correction mechanism that autonomously diagnoses and resolves simulation failures without human intervention. Comprehensive evaluations on 110 simulation tasks reveal that Foam-Agent achieves an impressive 83.6% success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, outperforming existing frameworks like MetaOpenFOAM (55.5%) and OpenFOAM-GPT (37.3%). Ablation studies highlight the importance of each component, with the specialized error correction yielding a 36.4% performance enhancement. Overall, Foam-Agent significantly reduces the CFD expertise barrier while ensuring accurate modeling, showcasing the potential of specialized multi-agent systems in making complex scientific simulation tools more accessible to a broader audience.

<div> Keywords: tragedy of the commons, multi-agent systems, reputation systems, RepuNet, cooperation  

<br /><br />Summary: The paper addresses the challenge of the "tragedy of the commons," where individual self-interest results in detrimental collective outcomes, a phenomenon observed in generative multi-agent systems (MASs). To combat this issue, the authors propose a novel framework called RepuNet, which features a dynamic, dual-level reputation system. This system models both agent-level reputation changes and the evolution of the overall network. Agents in the MAS create reputations for themselves and their peers based on direct interactions and indirect gossip. These reputations influence their decisions to connect or disconnect from other agents for future interactions. Through two distinct scenarios, the effectiveness of RepuNet in mitigating the tragedy of the commons is demonstrated, showing its potential to foster and maintain cooperation within generative MASs. Furthermore, the study reveals that implementing reputation systems can lead to the emergence of complex behaviors within these systems, such as the formation of cooperative clusters, the social isolation of exploitative agents, and a tendency among agents to share positive gossip over negative gossip. <div>

Abstract: The tragedy of the commons, where individual self-interest leads to collectively disastrous outcomes, is a pervasive challenge in human society. Recent studies have demonstrated that similar phenomena can arise in generative multi-agent systems (MASs). To address this challenge, this paper explores the use of reputation systems as a remedy. We propose RepuNet, a dynamic, dual-level reputation framework that models both agent-level reputation dynamics and system-level network evolution. Specifically, driven by direct interactions and indirect gossip, agents form reputations for both themselves and their peers, and decide whether to connect or disconnect other agents for future interactions. Through two distinct scenarios, we show that RepuNet effectively mitigates the 'tragedy of the commons', promoting and sustaining cooperation in generative MASs. Moreover, we find that reputation systems can give rise to rich emergent behaviors in generative MASs, such as the formation of cooperative clusters, the social isolation of exploitative agents, and the preference for sharing positive gossip rather than negative ones.

<div> Keywords: analog ICs, reinforcement learning, floorplanning, hybrid method, beam strategy  

<br /><br />Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for the automated layout of analog integrated circuits (ICs) by leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) and a beam strategy (BS) to navigate complex trade-offs inherent in device physics and circuit variability. The hybrid method improves the inference process of the RL agent, enabling the generation of flexible floorplans tailored to various objective weightings while addressing congestion issues without the need for policy retraining or fine-tuning. The RL agent retains its generalization ability, effectively managing circuit features and constraints. Experimental findings demonstrate a notable improvement of approximately 5-85% in key metrics including area, dead space, and half-perimeter wire length compared to traditional RL applications. Furthermore, the RL agent achieves higher reward metrics, showcasing its effectiveness. The performance and efficiency of this hybrid approach align closely with existing state-of-the-art techniques in the field, marking a significant advancement in the automation of analog IC layout design. Overall, this work highlights the potential of integrating RL with BS to overcome the challenges of circuit layout optimization. <div>

Abstract: The layout of analog ICs requires making complex trade-offs, while addressing device physics and variability of the circuits. This makes full automation with learning-based solutions hard to achieve. However, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently reached significant results, particularly in solving the floorplanning problem. This paper presents a hybrid method that combines RL with a beam (BS) strategy. The BS algorithm enhances the agent's inference process, allowing for the generation of flexible floorplans by accomodating various objective weightings, and addressing congestion without without the need for policy retraining or fine-tuning. Moreover, the RL agent's generalization ability stays intact, along with its efficient handling of circuit features and constraints. Experimental results show approx. 5-85% improvement in area, dead space and half-perimeter wire length compared to a standard RL application, along with higher rewards for the agent. Moreover, performance and efficiency align closely with those of existing state-of-the-art techniques.

<div> Keywords: neuro-symbolic AI, sequence classification, temporal dimension, knowledge-driven, benchmarking framework  

<br /><br />Summary: This work addresses a key challenge in neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence: utilizing background knowledge to enhance learning tasks, particularly in a dynamic context. Unlike existing frameworks that assume static knowledge, this study explores knowledge-driven sequence classification where different knowledge segments must be leveraged at varying timesteps, incorporating temporal relations. The authors introduce a novel benchmarking framework to rigorously evaluate the performance of various architectures. Their experimental setup compares multi-stage neuro-symbolic systems with traditional neural-only approaches. Results reveal the complexity and difficulties inherent in this new setting, indicating significant limitations of current neuro-symbolic methods. By illuminating these under-explored challenges, the findings serve as an essential reference point for future research in the field, prompting further investigation into the optimization of neuro-symbolic techniques within time-sensitive learning tasks. Overall, the study marks a significant contribution to understanding how background knowledge can be effectively integrated into artificial intelligence systems operating in dynamic environments. <div>

Abstract: One of the goals of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence is to exploit background knowledge to improve the performance of learning tasks. However, most of the existing frameworks focus on the simplified scenario where knowledge does not change over time and does not cover the temporal dimension. In this work we consider the much more challenging problem of knowledge-driven sequence classification where different portions of knowledge must be employed at different timesteps, and temporal relations are available. Our experimental evaluation compares multi-stage neuro-symbolic and neural-only architectures, and it is conducted on a newly-introduced benchmarking framework. Results demonstrate the challenging nature of this novel setting, and also highlight under-explored shortcomings of neuro-symbolic methods, representing a precious reference for future research.

<div> Keywords: Embodied AI, multi-agent systems, real-world applications, adaptation, collaborative problem-solving

<br /><br />Summary: Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) integrates AI systems with physical bodies, utilizing sensors and actuators to interact with real-world environments effectively. As techniques like deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language models advance, the field sees applications in robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems in static, closed environments. In contrast, real-world scenarios demand more complex, dynamic interactions. These environments require agents to collaborate and adapt, highlighting a need for sophisticated mechanisms for real-time learning and problem-solving. Despite a growing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains limited and often relies on oversimplified models. This paper addresses the lack of comprehensive surveys on multi-agent embodied AI, emphasizing the importance of understanding its complexity. It reviews current research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions. The insights provided aim to guide innovation and progress in addressing the real-world challenges presented by embodied AI systems in multi-agent environments. Understanding these dynamics is crucial as the field continues to evolve rapidly. <div>

Abstract: Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) plays a pivotal role in the application of advanced technologies in the intelligent era, where AI systems are integrated with physical bodies that enable them to perceive, reason, and interact with their environments. Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions, providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.

<div> Keywords: AI agents, task performance, failure rate, empirical model, subtasks

<br /><br />Summary: The article builds on the research conducted by Kwa et al. (2025) and analyzes the performance of AI agents on longer-duration tasks. It proposes a simple mathematical model that attributes task performance to a constant failure rate for every minute a human would take to complete a task. This leads to an understanding that the success rate of the agents declines exponentially with the length of the task. Each AI agent can be characterized by a specific half-life, allowing for the estimation of success rates at varying task durations. The model effectively fits the observed data, suggesting that tasks of greater length typically consist of many subtasks, where a failure in any one subtask results in the failure of the overall task. This finding raises questions about the general applicability of the model across different task categories, highlighting the need for further research to explore its broader implications. Overall, the study underscores how task complexity and failure patterns can inform our understanding of AI performance in research-engineering contexts. <div>

Abstract: Building on the recent empirical work of Kwa et al. (2025), I show that within their suite of research-engineering tasks the performance of AI agents on longer-duration tasks can be explained by an extremely simple mathematical model -- a constant rate of failing during each minute a human would take to do the task. This implies an exponentially declining success rate with the length of the task and that each agent could be characterised by its own half-life. This empirical regularity allows us to estimate the success rate for an agent at different task lengths. And the fact that this model is a good fit for the data is suggestive of the underlying causes of failure on longer tasks -- that they involve increasingly large sets of subtasks where failing any one fails the task. Whether this model applies more generally on other suites of tasks is unknown and an important subject for further work.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, refined memory, knowledge gap, Memory-Augmented Refinement, personalized AI

<br /><br />Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) are useful for specialized tasks but have difficulty keeping up with evolving domain knowledge without costly fine-tuning. Domain knowledge includes immutable facts and evolving insights shaped by real-world changes. A significant gap exists between the nuanced understanding of domain experts and the knowledge LLMs possess, which can affect information retrieval and application. To address this, the Memory-Augmented Refinement of Knowledge (MARK) framework enables LLMs to continuously learn by utilizing structured refined memory through specialized agents. These agents include the Residual Refined Memory Agent, which stores domain-specific insights; the User Question Refined Memory Agent, which captures user-provided terminology; and the LLM Response Refined Memory Agent, which extracts key elements for refinement. They work together to analyze stored memory, resolve contradictions, and enhance response accuracy, factoring in recency and relevance. MARK enhances LLMs by reducing hallucinations through a structured reference (Ground Truth Strategy), facilitating domain-specific adaptation, especially in sensitive fields like healthcare, and improving personalized AI interactions by remembering user preferences for coherent responses over time. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in specialized tasks but struggle to align with evolving domain knowledge without costly fine-tuning. Domain knowledge consists of: Knowledge: Immutable facts (e.g., 'A stone is solid') and generally accepted principles (e.g., ethical standards); Refined Memory: Evolving insights shaped by business needs and real-world changes. However, a significant gap often exists between a domain expert's deep, nuanced understanding and the system's domain knowledge, which can hinder accurate information retrieval and application. Our Memory-Augmented Refinement of Knowledge (MARK) framework enables LLMs to continuously learn without retraining by leveraging structured refined memory, inspired by the Society of Mind. MARK operates through specialized agents, each serving a distinct role: Residual Refined Memory Agent: Stores and retrieves domain-specific insights to maintain context over time; User Question Refined Memory Agent: Captures user-provided facts, abbreviations, and terminology for better comprehension; LLM Response Refined Memory Agent: Extracts key elements from responses for refinement and personalization. These agents analyse stored refined memory, detect patterns, resolve contradictions, and improve response accuracy. Temporal factors like recency and frequency prioritize relevant information while discarding outdated insights. MARK enhances LLMs in multiple ways: Ground Truth Strategy: Reduces hallucinations by establishing a structured reference; Domain-Specific Adaptation: Essential for fields like healthcare, law, and manufacturing, where proprietary insights are absent from public datasets; Personalized AI Assistants: Improves virtual assistants by remembering user preferences, ensuring coherent responses over time.

<div> Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, alignment, moral diversity, appropriateness framework, conflict management  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses the pressing issue of ensuring that AI systems operate ethically as they increasingly impact areas such as online moderation and policy advice. It critiques a prevalent approach known as "alignment," which assumes a unified ethical framework, arguing that it neglects moral diversity and could lead to resistance and erosion of trust in institutions. The authors identify the underlying problem as the Axiom of Rational Convergence, which posits that rational agents will eventually agree on a single ethics under ideal conditions. They suggest that this idea is both dubious and optional. To tackle the issues of moral disagreement, the paper proposes the appropriateness framework, which is built on principles from conflict theory, cultural evolution, multi-agent systems, and institutional economics. This framework accepts persistent disagreement as normal and promotes four key principles: contextual grounding, community customization, continual adaptation, and polycentric governance. The authors argue that shifting the metaphor of alignment from one of moral unification to conflict management through these principles is both necessary and urgent for the future of ethical AI. <div>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly placed in positions where their decisions have real consequences, e.g., moderating online spaces, conducting research, and advising on policy. Ensuring they operate in a safe and ethically acceptable fashion is thus critical. However, most solutions have been a form of one-size-fits-all "alignment". We are worried that such systems, which overlook enduring moral diversity, will spark resistance, erode trust, and destabilize our institutions. This paper traces the underlying problem to an often-unstated Axiom of Rational Convergence: the idea that under ideal conditions, rational agents will converge in the limit of conversation on a single ethics. Treating that premise as both optional and doubtful, we propose what we call the appropriateness framework: an alternative approach grounded in conflict theory, cultural evolution, multi-agent systems, and institutional economics. The appropriateness framework treats persistent disagreement as the normal case and designs for it by applying four principles: (1) contextual grounding, (2) community customization, (3) continual adaptation, and (4) polycentric governance. We argue here that adopting these design principles is a good way to shift the main alignment metaphor from moral unification to a more productive metaphor of conflict management, and that taking this step is both desirable and urgent.

<div> Keywords: formal verification, deep neural networks, safety properties, abstract interpretation, adversarial inputs

<br /><br />Summary: Traditional formal verification methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) rely on a binary classification of safety properties, categorizing models purely as safe or unsafe. This limited approach often overlooks the gradations of safety levels, leading to overly stringent or lenient requirements. The paper introduces a new concept termed Abstract DNN-Verification, which allows for the verification of a hierarchical structure of unsafe outputs. This innovative method offers a nuanced safety analysis by employing abstract interpretation and examining output reachable sets, enabling the evaluation of multiple safety levels within the verification process. Remarkably, this approach can match or even reduce the computational demands of traditional binary verification methods. Furthermore, the formulation allows for the ranking of adversarial inputs based on their degree of safety level violation, leading to a more thorough assessment of a model's safety and robustness. The authors present a theoretical exploration linking this new formulation to existing methods that use abstract interpretation for robustness verification, conduct a complexity analysis, and provide empirical results leveraging both complex deep reinforcement learning tasks and standard DNN-Verification benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2505.05235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods for formal verification (FV) of deep neural networks (DNNs) are constrained by a binary encoding of safety properties, where a model is classified as either safe or unsafe (robust or not robust). This binary encoding fails to capture the nuanced safety levels within a model, often resulting in either overly restrictive or too permissive requirements. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem formulation called Abstract DNN-Verification, which verifies a hierarchical structure of unsafe outputs, providing a more granular analysis of the safety aspect for a given DNN. Crucially, by leveraging abstract interpretation and reasoning about output reachable sets, our approach enables assessing multiple safety levels during the FV process, requiring the same (in the worst case) or even potentially less computational effort than the traditional binary verification approach. Specifically, we demonstrate how this formulation allows rank adversarial inputs according to their abstract safety level violation, offering a more detailed evaluation of the model's safety and robustness. Our contributions include a theoretical exploration of the relationship between our novel abstract safety formulation and existing approaches that employ abstract interpretation for robustness verification, complexity analysis of the novel problem introduced, and an empirical evaluation considering both a complex deep reinforcement learning task (based on Habitat 3.0) and standard DNN-Verification benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: EcoAgent, mobile agents, edge-cloud collaboration, task success rates, token consumption  

<br /><br />Summary: The paper introduces EcoAgent, an innovative framework aimed at enhancing mobile automation through a collaborative system involving both edge and cloud components. EcoAgent comprises a cloud-based Planning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent to carry out actions and the Observation Agent to verify results. A significant advantage of this system is the Observation Agent's Pre-Understanding Module, which converts screen images into concise text, thereby minimizing token usage for large language models (LLMs). This reduction is crucial given the high latency and cost typically associated with cloud-based LLMs. In the event of task failures, the Planning Agent utilizes a Reflection Module to reassess and replan based on retrieved screen history. Experiments conducted on the AndroidWorld platform demonstrate that EcoAgent effectively maintains high task success rates while notably decreasing LLM token consumption, making it both efficient and applicable for practical mobile automation scenarios. Overall, EcoAgent represents a promising solution in the field of mobile automation, balancing the strengths of cloud and edge computing while optimizing resource usage. <div>
arXiv:2505.05440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud-based mobile agents powered by (multimodal) large language models ((M)LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities but suffer from high latency and cost. While fine-tuned (M)SLMs enable edge deployment, they often lose general capabilities and struggle with complex tasks. To address this, we propose EcoAgent, an Edge-Cloud cOllaborative multi-agent framework for mobile automation. EcoAgent features a closed-loop collaboration among a cloud-based Planning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent for action execution and the Observation Agent for verifying outcomes. The Observation Agent uses a Pre-Understanding Module to compress screen images into concise text, reducing token usage. In case of failure, the Planning Agent retrieves screen history and replans via a Reflection Module. Experiments on AndroidWorld show that EcoAgent maintains high task success rates while significantly reducing MLLM token consumption, enabling efficient and practical mobile automation.

<div> Keywords: large language models, business process management, process model redesign, explainable changes, domain experts

<br /><br />Summary: 
The rise of large language models (LLMs) is facilitating the development of AI-augmented Business Process Management (BPM) systems that allow for conversational interactions. Most existing research concentrates on single-prompt use, overlooking the potential for continuous dialogue with users. This paper introduces the Conversational Process Model Redesign (CPD) approach, which empowers domain experts to iteratively create and redesign process models based on natural language inputs. The CPD approach involves three steps: identifying process change patterns from existing literature, rephrasing user requests to fit these patterns, and applying the necessary changes to the process model. This multi-step framework promotes explainability and reproducibility in modifications. An extensive evaluation was conducted to assess the feasibility of the CPD method and the handling of identified patterns by the LLM. Results indicated that while some patterns can be challenging for both LLMs and users to comprehend, overall, most change requests were successfully managed according to established criteria of completeness and correctness. The study highlights the necessity of user support in articulating changes effectively for improved outcomes. <div>
arXiv:2505.05453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent success of large language models (LLMs), the idea of AI-augmented Business Process Management systems is becoming more feasible. One of their essential characteristics is the ability to be conversationally actionable, allowing humans to interact with the LLM effectively to perform crucial process life cycle tasks such as process model design and redesign. However, most current research focuses on single-prompt execution and evaluation of results, rather than on continuous interaction between the user and the LLM. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of using LLMs to empower domain experts in the creation and redesign of process models in an iterative and effective way. The proposed conversational process model redesign (CPD) approach receives as input a process model and a redesign request by the user in natural language. Instead of just letting the LLM make changes, the LLM is employed to (a) identify process change patterns from literature, (b) re-phrase the change request to be aligned with an expected wording for the identified pattern (i.e., the meaning), and then to (c) apply the meaning of the change to the process model. This multi-step approach allows for explainable and reproducible changes. In order to ensure the feasibility of the CPD approach, and to find out how well the patterns from literature can be handled by the LLM, we performed an extensive evaluation. The results show that some patterns are hard to understand by LLMs and by users. Within the scope of the study, we demonstrated that users need support to describe the changes clearly. Overall the evaluation shows that the LLMs can handle most changes well according to a set of completeness and correctness criteria.

<div> Keywords: recommender systems, generative models, evaluation challenges, personalization, content safety  

<br /><br />Summary: 
The paper discusses the advancements and risks associated with recommender systems powered by generative models (Gen-RecSys). It highlights the dual nature of these systems: while they enhance personalization and user engagement through dynamic content and interactive dialogues, they also pose new risks such as the creation of nonexistent items (hallucinations), the amplification of biases, and potential privacy breaches. Traditional metrics used to evaluate accuracy are inadequate as they do not address issues related to factual correctness, content safety, or alignment with user intent. The authors categorize the evaluation challenges into two main groups: (i) concerns that are aggravated by generative outputs (like bias and privacy) and (ii) new risks specific to generative models (such as contradictory explanations). To tackle these challenges, the paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation approach that emphasizes scenario-based assessments and employs multiple metrics, including relevance, factual grounding, bias detection, and compliance with policies. The aim is to establish a robust framework that assists researchers and practitioners in effectively evaluating Gen-RecSys, promoting responsible deployment, and enhancing personalization strategies. <div>
arXiv:2504.06667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems powered by generative models (Gen-RecSys) extend beyond classical item ranking by producing open-ended content, which simultaneously unlocks richer user experiences and introduces new risks. On one hand, these systems can enhance personalization and appeal through dynamic explanations and multi-turn dialogues. On the other hand, they might venture into unknown territory-hallucinating nonexistent items, amplifying bias, or leaking private information. Traditional accuracy metrics cannot fully capture these challenges, as they fail to measure factual correctness, content safety, or alignment with user intent.
  This paper makes two main contributions. First, we categorize the evaluation challenges of Gen-RecSys into two groups: (i) existing concerns that are exacerbated by generative outputs (e.g., bias, privacy) and (ii) entirely new risks (e.g., item hallucinations, contradictory explanations). Second, we propose a holistic evaluation approach that includes scenario-based assessments and multi-metric checks-incorporating relevance, factual grounding, bias detection, and policy compliance. Our goal is to provide a guiding framework so researchers and practitioners can thoroughly assess Gen-RecSys, ensuring effective personalization and responsible deployment.

<div> Keywords: large language models, social agents, benchmark, COT complexity, HSII dataset  

<br /><br />Summary: The article addresses the need for large language models (LLMs) to function effectively in multi-user, multi-turn social agent tasks, moving beyond their role as auxiliary assistants. Currently, the measurement of LLM capabilities in these scenarios lacks systematic benchmarks. To fill this gap, the authors introduce an agent task leveling framework based on sociological principles and a new benchmark called How Social Is It (HSII) designed to assess LLM social capabilities. HSII consists of four stages: format parsing, target selection, target switching conversation, and stable conversation, aimed at evaluating communication and task completion in realistic social interactions. The dataset used for HSII, HSII-Dataset, is derived from news data through a step-by-step process. The authors also conduct an ablation study through dataset clustering and investigate the effectiveness of the chain of thought (COT) method, introducing a new metric, COT-complexity, to measure the efficiency of LLMs when using COT for specific social tasks. Various experimental results indicate that HSII is a robust benchmark for evaluating the social skills of LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Expanding the application of large language models (LLMs) to societal life, instead of primary function only as auxiliary assistants to communicate with only one person at a time, necessitates LLMs' capabilities to independently play roles in multi-user, multi-turn social agent tasks within complex social settings. However, currently the capability has not been systematically measured with available benchmarks. To address this gap, we first introduce an agent task leveling framework grounded in sociological principles. Concurrently, we propose a novel benchmark, How Social Is It (we call it HSII below), designed to assess LLM's social capabilities in comprehensive social agents tasks and benchmark representative models. HSII comprises four stages: format parsing, target selection, target switching conversation, and stable conversation, which collectively evaluate the communication and task completion capabilities of LLMs within realistic social interaction scenarios dataset, HSII-Dataset. The dataset is derived step by step from news dataset. We perform an ablation study by doing clustering to the dataset. Additionally, we investigate the impact of chain of thought (COT) method on enhancing LLMs' social performance. Since COT cost more computation, we further introduce a new statistical metric, COT-complexity, to quantify the efficiency of certain LLMs with COTs for specific social tasks and strike a better trade-off between measurement of correctness and efficiency. Various results of our experiments demonstrate that our benchmark is well-suited for evaluating social skills in LLMs.

<div> Keywords: Kurdish, speaker detection, dialects, machine learning, recognition performance  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This work examines the complexities involved in detecting speakers of Kurdish across its multiple dialects, specifically Kurmanji, Sorani, and Hawrami. The phonetic and lexical variations among these dialects present unique challenges for speaker recognition systems. The study identifies the main difficulties faced in developing an effective speaker identification system that can accurately recognize speakers from different dialects. To enhance the accuracy and reliability of these systems, the research suggests several solutions, including the use of advanced machine learning techniques, data augmentation strategies, and the creation of comprehensive, dialect-specific corpora.

Abstract: The complexity and difficulties of Kurdish speaker detection among its several dialects are investigated in this work. Because of its great phonetic and lexical differences, Kurdish with several dialects including Kurmanji, Sorani, and Hawrami offers special challenges for speaker recognition systems. The main difficulties in building a strong speaker identification system capable of precisely identifying speakers across several dialects are investigated in this work. To raise the accuracy and dependability of these systems, it also suggests solutions like sophisticated machine learning approaches, data augmentation tactics, and the building of thorough dialect-specific corpus. The results show that customized strategies for every dialect together with cross-dialect training greatly enhance recognition performance.

<div> Keywords: multimodal large language models, human cognition, tokenization, dynamic representation, visual-linguistic tasks  

<br /><br />Summary: This research investigates the differences between human cognitive processes and the integration of multimodal information in computational models. It particularly focuses on the alignment between human cross-modal chunking and token representation methods in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Empirical studies reveal that traditional static tokenization methods limit the models' ability to reflect the dynamic and context-sensitive nature of human information processing. To address this, the authors propose a new framework for dynamic cross-modal tokenization, which employs adaptive boundaries, hierarchical representations, and cognitive science-based alignment mechanisms. Quantitative results indicate that this innovative approach outperforms existing models on benchmark tasks, achieving improvements of 7.8% in Visual Question Answering and 5.3% in Complex Scene Description. Additionally, the proposed method aligns better with human-like error patterns and attention distributions. These findings enhance the understanding of the connection between human cognition and artificial intelligence, offering valuable insights for developing AI systems that better mimic human cognitive capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing diverse data types, yet significant disparities persist between human cognitive processes and computational approaches to multimodal information integration. This research presents a systematic investigation into the parallels between human cross-modal chunking mechanisms and token representation methodologies in MLLMs. Through empirical studies comparing human performance patterns with model behaviors across visual-linguistic tasks, we demonstrate that conventional static tokenization schemes fundamentally constrain current models' capacity to simulate the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of human information processing. We propose a novel framework for dynamic cross-modal tokenization that incorporates adaptive boundaries, hierarchical representations, and alignment mechanisms grounded in cognitive science principles. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art models on benchmark tasks (+7.8% on Visual Question Answering, +5.3% on Complex Scene Description) while exhibiting more human-aligned error patterns and attention distributions. These findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of the relationship between human cognition and artificial intelligence, while providing empirical evidence for developing more cognitively plausible AI systems.

<div> Keywords: speech-to-speech translation, accent adaptation, conditional generation, diffusion models, Mel spectrograms  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) focuses on converting spoken input from one language to spoken output in another, traditionally emphasizing either language translation or accent adaptation. This work addresses the need for effective cross-cultural communication by proposing a unified approach that simultaneously handles both translation and accent change. The authors reformulate the S2ST task as a conditional generation problem, where the target speech is produced based on phonemes and specific features of the target speech. By employing diffusion models known for their high-fidelity generative capabilities, the authors adapt strategies from text-to-image generation. Their method conditions on source speech transcriptions and generates Mel spectrograms that embody the desired linguistic and accentual characteristics of the target language. This integrated framework allows for joint optimization of translation and accent adaptation, resulting in a more parameter-efficient and effective model compared to traditional approaches. The work highlights the potential of leveraging advanced generative techniques to improve the quality of S2ST, paving the way for better communication across diverse linguistic backgrounds. <div>

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to convert spoken input in one language to spoken output in another, typically focusing on either language translation or accent adaptation. However, effective cross-cultural communication requires handling both aspects simultaneously - translating content while adapting the speaker's accent to match the target language context. In this work, we propose a unified approach for simultaneous speech translation and change of accent, a task that remains underexplored in current literature. Our method reformulates the problem as a conditional generation task, where target speech is generated based on phonemes and guided by target speech features. Leveraging the power of diffusion models, known for high-fidelity generative capabilities, we adapt text-to-image diffusion strategies by conditioning on source speech transcriptions and generating Mel spectrograms representing the target speech with desired linguistic and accentual attributes. This integrated framework enables joint optimization of translation and accent adaptation, offering a more parameter-efficient and effective model compared to traditional pipelines.

<div> Keywords: multimodal sentiment analysis, emotion classification, IEMOCAP dataset, fusion-based model, computational efficiency

<br /><br />Summary: 
This article focuses on multimodal sentiment analysis, which involves understanding human emotions through the integration of language, audio, and visual signals. It highlights the trend of utilizing complex models and attention mechanisms but proposes a lightweight and effective fusion-based deep learning model for utterance-level emotion classification. The authors utilize the IEMOCAP dataset, consisting of aligned text, audio-derived numeric features, and visual descriptors, to build their model. They develop modality-specific encoders using fully connected layers along with dropout regularization to handle different types of input data. Following this, they fuse the modality-specific representations through simple concatenation, which is then processed by a dense fusion layer to explore cross-modal interactions. This streamlined architecture is designed to minimize computational overhead while maintaining strong performance. Remarkably, the model achieves a classification accuracy of 92% across six distinct emotion categories. The proposed approach shows that with effective feature engineering and modular design, simpler fusion strategies can rival or even surpass the performance of more complex models, especially in settings where computational resources are limited. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis, a pivotal task in affective computing, seeks to understand human emotions by integrating cues from language, audio, and visual signals. While many recent approaches leverage complex attention mechanisms and hierarchical architectures, we propose a lightweight, yet effective fusion-based deep learning model tailored for utterance-level emotion classification. Using the benchmark IEMOCAP dataset, which includes aligned text, audio-derived numeric features, and visual descriptors, we design a modality-specific encoder using fully connected layers followed by dropout regularization. The modality-specific representations are then fused using simple concatenation and passed through a dense fusion layer to capture cross-modal interactions. This streamlined architecture avoids computational overhead while preserving performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 92% across six emotion categories. Our approach demonstrates that with careful feature engineering and modular design, simpler fusion strategies can outperform or match more complex models, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

<br /><br />Summary: This work introduces an open-source framework designed for benchmarking and evaluating text-to-image generation models. It emphasizes the role of metadata-augmented prompts in enhancing model performance. Using the DeepFashion-MultiModal dataset, the study conducts a thorough assessment of generated images through various quantitative metrics, including Weighted Score, CLIP-based similarity, LPIPS, FID, and retrieval-based measures, alongside qualitative analysis.

<div> Keywords: Language Models, diagnostic conversations, multimodal data, clinical consultations, AI evaluation

<br /><br />Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for facilitating diagnostic conversations, but evaluations have primarily focused on text-based interactions. In real-world care, instant messaging enables the sharing of multimodal medical artifacts between clinicians and patients. The Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) enhances diagnostic performance by interpreting multimodal data during consultations. It utilizes Gemini 2.0 Flash to maintain a state-aware dialogue framework, enabling dynamic control over conversation flow based on patient states and evolving diagnoses. Follow-up questions are strategically influenced by uncertainty, resulting in an organized history-taking process reminiscent of seasoned clinicians. A randomized, blinded OSCE-style study compared AMIE's consultations to those of primary care physicians (PCPs) using 105 scenarios involving diverse artifacts such as skin photos and ECGs. The evaluation rubric focused on multimodal skills, history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication, and empathy. Findings indicate that AMIE outperformed PCPs in 7 of 9 multimodal and 29 of 32 non-multimodal evaluation axes, including diagnostic accuracy. While the results reflect significant advancements in multimodal conversational diagnostic AI, further research is needed for real-world implementation. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential for conducting diagnostic conversations but evaluation has been largely limited to language-only interactions, deviating from the real-world requirements of remote care delivery. Instant messaging platforms permit clinicians and patients to upload and discuss multimodal medical artifacts seamlessly in medical consultation, but the ability of LLMs to reason over such data while preserving other attributes of competent diagnostic conversation remains unknown. Here we advance the conversational diagnosis and management performance of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new capability to gather and interpret multimodal data, and reason about this precisely during consultations. Leveraging Gemini 2.0 Flash, our system implements a state-aware dialogue framework, where conversation flow is dynamically controlled by intermediate model outputs reflecting patient states and evolving diagnoses. Follow-up questions are strategically directed by uncertainty in such patient states, leading to a more structured multimodal history-taking process that emulates experienced clinicians. We compared AMIE to primary care physicians (PCPs) in a randomized, blinded, OSCE-style study of chat-based consultations with patient actors. We constructed 105 evaluation scenarios using artifacts like smartphone skin photos, ECGs, and PDFs of clinical documents across diverse conditions and demographics. Our rubric assessed multimodal capabilities and other clinically meaningful axes like history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication, and empathy. Specialist evaluation showed AMIE to be superior to PCPs on 7/9 multimodal and 29/32 non-multimodal axes (including diagnostic accuracy). The results show clear progress in multimodal conversational diagnostic AI, but real-world translation needs further research.

<div> Keywords: PNN-UNet, deep neural networks, planarian neural network, image segmentation, 3D MRI

<br /><br />Summary: This study introduces PNN-UNet, a novel architecture designed for deep neural networks that mirrors the planarian neural network (PNN) structure, particularly in the realm of 3D medical image data. The neural structure of planarians includes two neural cords, with the cerebrum acting as a coordinator for different neurological functions. In PNN-UNet, this concept is translated into a model comprising a Deep-UNet and a Wide-UNet representing the neural cords, while a densely connected autoencoder simulates the role of the brain. This unique architectural design offers significant advantages over traditional single-network architectures like UNet and modular approaches such as Ensemble-UNet. The research findings, derived from experiments on a 3D MRI hippocampus dataset—both with and without data augmentation—indicate that PNN-UNet surpasses the performance of the baseline UNet and various UNet variants in the task of image segmentation. This innovative approach suggests a new pathway for enhancing performance in medical imaging tasks through biologically-inspired neural network structures. <div>

Abstract: Our study presents PNN-UNet as a method for constructing deep neural networks that replicate the planarian neural network (PNN) structure in the context of 3D medical image data. Planarians typically have a cerebral structure comprising two neural cords, where the cerebrum acts as a coordinator, and the neural cords serve slightly different purposes within the organism's neurological system. Accordingly, PNN-UNet comprises a Deep-UNet and a Wide-UNet as the nerve cords, with a densely connected autoencoder performing the role of the brain. This distinct architecture offers advantages over both monolithic (UNet) and modular networks (Ensemble-UNet). Our outcomes on a 3D MRI hippocampus dataset, with and without data augmentation, demonstrate that PNN-UNet outperforms the baseline UNet and several other UNet variants in image segmentation.

<div> Keywords: large language models, personalized advertising, BERT, user privacy, data security

<br /><br />Summary: This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs) in personalized advertising while addressing user privacy and data security. It begins by detailing the principles behind LLMs, particularly focusing on the Transformer architecture and the self-attention mechanism that enables natural language processing. It introduces the BERT model, integrating it with attention mechanisms to create a personalized advertising recommendation system that also considers user risk factors. The methodology includes stages such as data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, and using BERT for semantic advertising embedding based on user profiles. The study emphasizes local model training and data encryption techniques to protect user privacy and mitigate the risk of personal data leakage. An experimental framework is designed to test the effectiveness of BERT-based advertising recommendations using real user data, demonstrating an improvement in click-through and conversion rates for ads. Moreover, the implemented privacy protection strategies are shown to effectively reduce the risks associated with user privacy breaches in the context of personalized advertising. <div>
arXiv:2505.04665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although large language models have demonstrated the potential for personalized advertising recommendations in experimental environments, in actual operations, how advertising recommendation systems can be combined with measures such as user privacy protection and data security is still an area worthy of in-depth discussion. To this end, this paper studies the personalized risks and regulatory strategies of large language models in digital advertising. This study first outlines the principles of Large Language Model (LLM), especially the self-attention mechanism based on the Transformer architecture, and how to enable the model to understand and generate natural language text. Then, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model and the attention mechanism are combined to construct an algorithmic model for personalized advertising recommendations and user factor risk protection. The specific steps include: data collection and preprocessing, feature selection and construction, using large language models such as BERT for advertising semantic embedding, and ad recommendations based on user portraits. Then, local model training and data encryption are used to ensure the security of user privacy and avoid the leakage of personal data. This paper designs an experiment for personalized advertising recommendation based on a large language model of BERT and verifies it with real user data. The experimental results show that BERT-based advertising push can effectively improve the click-through rate and conversion rate of advertisements. At the same time, through local model training and privacy protection mechanisms, the risk of user privacy leakage can be reduced to a certain extent.

<div> Keywords: Vision Large Language Models, REVEAL Framework, multi-turn interactions, harm assessment, misinformation  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) combine image-processing and text understanding, enriching user interactions but also posing new safety and ethical challenges, especially in multi-modal and multi-turn conversations. Traditional evaluation methods fail to address these challenges. To meet this need, researchers developed the REVEAL (Responsible Evaluation of Vision-Enabled AI LLMs) Framework, a scalable and automated system designed for assessing harms associated with image inputs in VLLMs. The framework incorporates automated image mining, synthetic adversarial data generation, multi-turn conversational expansion via crescendo attacks, and thorough harm assessment using evaluators like GPT-4o. In their extensive evaluation of five leading VLLMs (GPT-4o, Llama-3.2, Qwen2-VL, Phi3.5V, and Pixtral), the researchers focused on three key harm categories: sexual harm, violence, and misinformation. Results demonstrated a significant increase in defect rates for multi-turn interactions compared to single-turn evaluations, revealing heightened vulnerabilities. GPT-4o showed the most balanced performance according to the Safety-Usability Index (SUI), with Pixtral closely following. Misinformation was identified as a critical concern, while Llama-3.2 and Qwen2-VL exhibited the highest defect and refusal rates, respectively. <div>

Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence by integrating image-processing capabilities with textual understanding, thereby enhancing user interactions and expanding application domains. However, their increased complexity introduces novel safety and ethical challenges, particularly in multi-modal and multi-turn conversations. Traditional safety evaluation frameworks, designed for text-based, single-turn interactions, are inadequate for addressing these complexities. To bridge this gap, we introduce the REVEAL (Responsible Evaluation of Vision-Enabled AI LLMs) Framework, a scalable and automated pipeline for evaluating image-input harms in VLLMs. REVEAL includes automated image mining, synthetic adversarial data generation, multi-turn conversational expansion using crescendo attack strategies, and comprehensive harm assessment through evaluators like GPT-4o.
  We extensively evaluated five state-of-the-art VLLMs, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2, Qwen2-VL, Phi3.5V, and Pixtral, across three important harm categories: sexual harm, violence, and misinformation. Our findings reveal that multi-turn interactions result in significantly higher defect rates compared to single-turn evaluations, highlighting deeper vulnerabilities in VLLMs. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrated the most balanced performance as measured by our Safety-Usability Index (SUI) followed closely by Pixtral. Additionally, misinformation emerged as a critical area requiring enhanced contextual defenses. Llama-3.2 exhibited the highest MT defect rate ($16.55 \%$) while Qwen2-VL showed the highest MT refusal rate ($19.1 \%$).

<br /><br />Summary: The ThEdu series aims to bridge the gap between intuitive mathematics learned in secondary school and the formal approaches required in STEM education, leveraging theorem-proving technologies for support. This volume encompasses contributions from the 13th International Workshop on Theorem Proving Components for Educational Software (ThEdu'24), which was held as a satellite event of CADE29 during IJCAR 2024 in Nancy, France. The workshop featured an invited talk by Jeremy Avigad from Carnegie Mellon University and 14 submitted presentations. An open call for papers resulted in 9 submissions, with 8 of those accepted by reviewers. The revised papers included in the volume reflect the diverse scope of ThEdu, addressing both automated deduction research and its educational applications. The volume editors express hope that the collected works will enhance the development of theorem-proving-based software and foster better collaboration between computer scientists, mathematicians, and educational stakeholders. Additionally, preparations are underway for ThEdu'25, to be held alongside the 30th International Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE-30) in Stuttgart, Germany, from July 28 to August 2, 2025. <div>

Abstract: The ThEdu series pursues the smooth transition from an intuitive way of doing mathematics at secondary school to a more formal approach to the subject in STEM education while favoring software support for this transition by exploiting the power of theorem-proving technologies.  What follows is a brief description of how the present volume contributes to this enterprise.  The 13th International Workshop on Theorem Proving Components for Educational Software (ThEdu'24), was a satellite event of the CADE29, part of IJCAR 2024, Nancy, France. ThEdu'24 was a vibrant workshop, with one invited talk by Jeremy Avigad (Carnegie Mellon University) and 14 submitted talks. An open call for papers was then issued and attracted 9 submissions. Eight of those submissions have been accepted by our reviewers. The resulting revised papers are collected in the present volume. The contributions in this volume are a faithful representation of the wide spectrum of ThEdu, ranging from those more focused on the automated deduction research, not losing track of the possible applications in an educational setting, to those focused on the applications, in educational settings, of automated deduction tools and methods. We, the volume editors, hope that this collection of papers will further promote the development of theorem-proving-based software and that it will allow to improve the mutual understanding between computer scientists, mathematicians, and stakeholders in education. While this volume goes to press, the next edition of the ThEdu workshop is being prepared: ThEdu'25 will be a satellite event of the 30th international Conference on Automated DEduction (CADE-30), July 28th - August 2nd, 2025, Stuttgart, Germany.

<div> Keywords: geometric neural networks, matrix Lie groups, actuator faults, Lyapunov method, multi-agent systems  

<br /><br />Summary: The article presents a tracking controller based on geometric neural networks for systems operating on matrix Lie groups while facing unknown dynamics, actuator faults, and bounded disturbances. It takes advantage of the left-invariance property of the tangent bundle of matrix Lie groups, which are identified as embedded submanifolds within the vector space $\R^{N\times N}$. The authors introduce learning rules for neural network weights that align with the Lie group's geometric structure and do not depend on explicit parameterization, effectively avoiding issues related to parameterization singularities. This facilitates a global search for optimal weights. Furthermore, the paper establishes the ultimate boundedness of all error signals, including neural network weights, a coordinate-free configuration error function, and tracking velocity errors, through Lyapunov's direct method. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed method, simulation results are provided, focusing on decentralized formation control for multi-agent systems within the Special Euclidean group framework. The overall approach underscores the advantage of leveraging geometric insights to enhance the robustness and effectiveness of control systems in dynamic environments. <div>

Abstract: We present a geometric neural network-based tracking controller for systems evolving on matrix Lie groups under unknown dynamics, actuator faults, and bounded disturbances. Leveraging the left-invariance of the tangent bundle of matrix Lie groups, viewed as an embedded submanifold of the vector space $\R^{N\times N}$, we propose a set of learning rules for neural network weights that are intrinsically compatible with the Lie group structure and do not require explicit parameterization. Exploiting the geometric properties of Lie groups, this approach circumvents parameterization singularities and enables a global search for optimal weights. The ultimate boundedness of all error signals -- including the neural network weights, the coordinate-free configuration error function, and the tracking velocity error -- is established using Lyapunov's direct method. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we provide illustrative simulation results for decentralized formation control of multi-agent systems on the Special Euclidean group.

<div> Keywords: Query-By-Document, information retrieval, domain-specific datasets, Large Language Models, BM25 model

<br /><br />Summary: The Query-By-Document (QBD) problem involves retrieving documents that match a specific query document, which can be critical for tasks like patent matching and academic literature reviews. Traditional retrieval methods, such as keyword search and document embeddings, can be tailored to perform better in specific domains, but creating custom datasets for these tasks can be expensive and time-consuming. This work introduces QBD-RankedDatagen, a novel process for generating custom QBD-search datasets and compares various methods in terms of cost, speed, and user-friendliness for domain experts. The methods leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate expert input for scoring and ranking documents, while also providing explanations to facilitate human review. This approach aims to significantly reduce the amount of human effort required in dataset creation, while still capturing essential expert knowledge necessary for tuning retrieval models. The effectiveness of these methods is evaluated using QBD datasets from the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC), wherein the parameters of the widely-used BM25 model are fine-tuned using the datasets generated through their proposed methods. <div>

This can be crucial for tasks such as patent matching, legal or compliance case retrieval, and academic literature review. Existing retrieval methods, including keyword search and document embeddings, can be optimized with domain-specific datasets to improve QBD search performance. However, creating these domain-specific datasets is often costly and time-consuming. Our work introduces a process to generate custom QBD-search datasets and compares a set of methods to use in this problem, which we refer to as QBD-RankedDatagen. We provide a comparative analysis of our proposed methods in terms of cost, speed, and the human interface with the domain experts. The methods we compare leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) which can incorporate domain expert input to produce document scores and rankings, as well as explanations for human review. The process and methods for it that we present can significantly reduce human effort in dataset creation for custom domains while still obtaining sufficient expert knowledge for tuning retrieval models. We evaluate our methods on QBD datasets from the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) and finetune the parameters of the BM25 model -- which is used in many industrial-strength search engines like OpenSearch -- using the generated data.

<div> Keywords: large language models, toxicity, pre-training, post-training, data quality  

<br /><br />Summary: The paper re-evaluates the concept of data quality in large language model (LLM) pretraining, examining its impact on model performance through pre- and post-training co-design. It investigates how using more toxic data during pre-training may lead to improved control in post-training, potentially reducing a model's output toxicity. A toy experiment is conducted to analyze how different data compositions influence feature representation geometry. Controlled experiments with Olmo-1B models reveal that as the proportion of toxic data increases, the toxicity representation becomes less entangled and more linear. Although training on toxic data initially leads to higher generational toxicity, this data also simplifies the detoxification process. Evaluations using Toxigen and Real Toxicity Prompts show that models trained with toxic data strike a better balance between lowering generational toxicity and maintaining overall capabilities when detoxification strategies like inference-time intervention (ITI) are applied. The findings indicate that considering post-training effects, the inclusion of lower-quality data may ultimately result in better-performing models. <div>

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) pretraining, data quality is believed to determine model quality. In this paper, we re-examine the notion of "quality" from the perspective of pre- and post-training co-design. Specifically, we explore the possibility that pre-training on more toxic data can lead to better control in post-training, ultimately decreasing a model's output toxicity. First, we use a toy experiment to study how data composition affects the geometry of features in the representation space. Next, through controlled experiments with Olmo-1B models trained on varying ratios of clean and toxic data, we find that the concept of toxicity enjoys a less entangled linear representation as the proportion of toxic data increases. Furthermore, we show that although toxic data increases the generational toxicity of the base model, it also makes the toxicity easier to remove. Evaluations on Toxigen and Real Toxicity Prompts demonstrate that models trained on toxic data achieve a better trade-off between reducing generational toxicity and preserving general capabilities when detoxifying techniques such as inference-time intervention (ITI) are applied. Our findings suggest that, with post-training taken into account, bad data may lead to good models.

<div> Keywords: app reviews, classification, zero-shot learning, ChatGPT, user feedback  

<br /><br />Summary: App reviews provide crucial insights into user experience, impacting app development and feature prioritization. Classifying these reviews into functional requirements (specific features) and non-functional requirements (broader quality attributes) is important for effective analysis. Traditional classification methods require large, domain-specific datasets which are difficult to obtain. This study investigates the use of zero-shot learning with ChatGPT to classify app reviews into four categories: functional requirement, non-functional requirement, both, or neither. The performance of ChatGPT was evaluated using a benchmark dataset of 1,880 manually annotated reviews from ten different apps across various domains. Results showed that ChatGPT achieved a strong F1 score of 0.842 in classifying reviews, despite facing challenges. The study also considers how review readability and length affect classification accuracy. Furthermore, a manual analysis was conducted to identify which review categories are more susceptible to misclassification. These findings highlight the potential of using advanced AI models like ChatGPT for efficient review classification, thereby assisting developers in making well-informed decisions regarding app improvements and user satisfaction. <div>

Abstract: App reviews are a critical source of user feedback, offering valuable insights into an app's performance, features, usability, and overall user experience. Effectively analyzing these reviews is essential for guiding app development, prioritizing feature updates, and enhancing user satisfaction. Classifying reviews into functional and non-functional requirements play a pivotal role in distinguishing feedback related to specific app features (functional requirements) from feedback concerning broader quality attributes, such as performance, usability, and reliability (non-functional requirements). Both categories are integral to informed development decisions. Traditional approaches to classifying app reviews are hindered by the need for large, domain-specific datasets, which are often costly and time-consuming to curate. This study explores the potential of zero-shot learning with ChatGPT for classifying app reviews into four categories: functional requirement, non-functional requirement, both, or neither. We evaluate ChatGPT's performance on a benchmark dataset of 1,880 manually annotated reviews from ten diverse apps spanning multiple domains. Our findings demonstrate that ChatGPT achieves a robust F1 score of 0.842 in review classification, despite certain challenges and limitations. Additionally, we examine how factors such as review readability and length impact classification accuracy and conduct a manual analysis to identify review categories more prone to misclassification.

<div> Keywords: Generative AI, risk assessment, chatbot, vulnerability testing, operational risks

<br /><br />Summary: The rise of Generative AI (Gen AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of sophisticated chatbots, but these tools also pose a range of operational risks beyond traditional cybersecurity issues. This research presents an innovative risk-assessment metric that evaluates potential threats to three key stakeholders: service providers, users, and third parties. The metric considers the technical complexity involved in inducing failures in chatbots, from simple errors to advanced prompt-injection attacks. Contextual factors, including industry specifics, user demographics, and severity of vulnerabilities are also integrated into the assessment. To validate the proposed metric, the study utilizes Garak, an open-source framework designed for LLM vulnerability testing, which is enhanced to address various threat vectors such as misinformation and social engineering. The methodology is demonstrated with chatbots using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), illustrating how the resulting risk scores can inform both immediate risk mitigation and long-term model improvements. The findings highlight the necessity of multi-dimensional risk assessments in ensuring secure and dependable AI-driven conversational systems. <div>

Abstract: The emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled more advanced chatbots capable of human-like interactions. However, these conversational agents introduce a broader set of operational risks that extend beyond traditional cybersecurity considerations. In this work, we propose a novel, instrumented risk-assessment metric that simultaneously evaluates potential threats to three key stakeholders: the service-providing organization, end users, and third parties. Our approach incorporates the technical complexity required to induce erroneous behaviors in the chatbot--ranging from non-induced failures to advanced prompt-injection attacks--as well as contextual factors such as the target industry, user age range, and vulnerability severity. To validate our metric, we leverage Garak, an open-source framework for LLM vulnerability testing. We further enhance Garak to capture a variety of threat vectors (e.g., misinformation, code hallucinations, social engineering, and malicious code generation). Our methodology is demonstrated in a scenario involving chatbots that employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), showing how the aggregated risk scores guide both short-term mitigation and longer-term improvements in model design and deployment. The results underscore the importance of multi-dimensional risk assessments in operationalizing secure, reliable AI-driven conversational systems.

<br /><br />Summary: This study explores the cultural expressions during the Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1279) dynasties, focusing on floral motifs as both poetic and artistic elements. It highlights a gap in scholarship regarding the connection between literary emotions and visual culture. Employing BERT-based sentiment analysis, the research quantifies the emotional patterns associated with floral imagery in Tang Song poetry, specifically examining peonies and plum blossoms. The analysis reveals measurable shifts in emotional connotations between the two dynasties. To validate these findings, the study cross-references the textual emotional patterns with visual evidence from textiles, ceramics, and other artifacts of material culture. This approach integrates computational humanities techniques with traditional sinological methods, promoting a comprehensive understanding of how literary expression influenced artistic representation. Ultimately, the research uncovers previously unrecognized synergies between these two domains of cultural activity, illustrating the profound interconnectedness of poetry and visual arts in ancient China. <div>

Abstract: The Tang (618 to 907) and Song (960 to 1279) dynasties witnessed an extraordinary flourishing of Chinese cultural expression, where floral motifs served as a dynamic medium for both poetic sentiment and artistic design. While previous scholarship has examined these domains independently, the systematic correlation between evolving literary emotions and visual culture remains underexplored. This study addresses that gap by employing BERT-based sentiment analysis to quantify emotional patterns in floral imagery across Tang Song poetry, then validating these patterns against contemporaneous developments in decorative arts.Our approach builds upon recent advances in computational humanities while remaining grounded in traditional sinological methods. By applying a fine tuned BERT model to analyze peony and plum blossom imagery in classical poetry, we detect measurable shifts in emotional connotations between the Tang and Song periods. These textual patterns are then cross berenced with visual evidence from textiles, ceramics, and other material culture, revealing previously unrecognized synergies between literary expression and artistic representation.

<div> Keywords: Continual Learning, Generative Replay, Unsupervised, Catastrophic Forgetting, Clustering

<br /><br />Summary: 
Continual Learning focuses on progressively acquiring knowledge from new data while retaining existing knowledge, addressing the challenge of "Catastrophic Forgetting" in neural networks. This paper introduces a novel uncertainty-driven Unsupervised Continual Learning framework termed "Replay to Remember (R2R)". R2R effectively utilizes both unlabelled and synthetic labelled data through a balanced approach that incorporates a cluster-level uncertainty-driven feedback mechanism and a generative replay module powered by a Visual Language Model (VLM). Unlike traditional methods that rely on pretrained models and pseudo-labels, R2R operates without prior training, leveraging visual features from unlabeled data while adapting through clustering-based uncertainty estimation and dynamic thresholding. It also employs a generative replay mechanism alongside DeepSeek-R1 powered CLIP VLM to create labelled synthetic data that represents past experiences, mimicking biological visual thinking. Extensive experiments conducted across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, SVHN, and TinyImageNet datasets demonstrate that the R2R approach significantly enhances knowledge retention, achieving superior performance with metrics of 98.13%, 73.06%, 93.41%, 95.18%, and 59.74%, exceeding existing state-of-the-art performance by over 4.36%. <div>

Abstract: Continual Learning entails progressively acquiring knowledge from new data while retaining previously acquired knowledge, thereby mitigating ``Catastrophic Forgetting'' in neural networks. Our work presents a novel uncertainty-driven Unsupervised Continual Learning framework using Generative Replay, namely ``Replay to Remember (R2R)''. The proposed R2R architecture efficiently uses unlabelled and synthetic labelled data in a balanced proportion using a cluster-level uncertainty-driven feedback mechanism and a VLM-powered generative replay module. Unlike traditional memory-buffer methods that depend on pretrained models and pseudo-labels, our R2R framework operates without any prior training. It leverages visual features from unlabeled data and adapts continuously using clustering-based uncertainty estimation coupled with dynamic thresholding. Concurrently, a generative replay mechanism along with DeepSeek-R1 powered CLIP VLM produces labelled synthetic data representative of past experiences, resembling biological visual thinking that replays memory to remember and act in new, unseen tasks. Extensive experimental analyses are carried out in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, SVHN and TinyImageNet datasets. Our proposed R2R approach improves knowledge retention, achieving a state-of-the-art performance of 98.13%, 73.06%, 93.41%, 95.18%, 59.74%, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art performance by over 4.36%.

<div> Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, reservoir computers, confabulation, untrained attractor, learning systems

<br /><br />Summary: This paper discusses the phenomenon of confabulation in artificial neural networks (ANNs), particularly focusing on reservoir computers (RCs). Despite advancements in AI, the mechanisms behind learning and the production of false information in ANNs remain poorly understood. The study explores how RCs, when trained to replicate specific dynamic behaviors known as attractors, occasionally generate 'untrained attractors' (UAs)—dynamic states that were not included in their training. This analysis highlights the nature of UAs in the context of RCs, suggesting that they emerge when the system's reconstruction efforts fail. Furthermore, the research indicates that UAs influence the dynamics between reconstructed attractors. The findings suggest that this form of confabulation is not limited to reservoir computers but may also occur in other bounded learning systems, offering foundational insights into broader implications of confabulation in artificial intelligence. The intrinsic presence of UAs in learning systems underscores the complex nature of how these systems process and generate information, paving the way for further exploration of similar phenomena across various artificial intelligence frameworks. <div>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has advanced significantly in recent years thanks to innovations in the design and training of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Despite these advancements, we still understand relatively little about how elementary forms of ANNs learn, fail to learn, and generate false information without the intent to deceive, a phenomenon known as `confabulation'. To provide some foundational insight, in this paper we analyse how confabulation occurs in reservoir computers (RCs): a dynamical system in the form of an ANN. RCs are particularly useful to study as they are known to confabulate in a well-defined way: when RCs are trained to reconstruct the dynamics of a given attractor, they sometimes construct an attractor that they were not trained to construct, a so-called `untrained attractor' (UA). This paper sheds light on the role played by UAs when reconstruction fails and their influence when modelling transitions between reconstructed attractors. Based on our results, we conclude that UAs are an intrinsic feature of learning systems whose state spaces are bounded, and that this means of confabulation may be present in systems beyond RCs.

<div> Keywords: climate downscaling, ORBIT-2, Residual Slim ViT, TILES, self-attention complexity

<br /><br />Summary:  
Sparse observations and coarse-resolution climate models hinder effective regional decision-making, highlighting the necessity for advanced downscaling methods. Existing AI techniques often fail to generalize across varied variables and geographic locations while being limited by the quadratic complexity of Vision Transformer (ViT) self-attention mechanisms. To address these challenges, we introduce ORBIT-2, a cutting-edge, scalable foundation model designed for global hyper-resolution climate downscaling. ORBIT-2 features two groundbreaking innovations: (1) the Residual Slim ViT (Reslim), a streamlined architecture that leverages residual learning and Bayesian regularization to enable efficient and robust predictions; and (2) TILES, a tile-wise sequence scaling algorithm that transforms self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear, facilitating long-sequence processing and enabling massive parallelism. This model can scale up to 10 billion parameters utilizing 32,768 GPUs, achieving an impressive sustained throughput of up to 1.8 ExaFLOPS and a strong scaling efficiency of 92-98%. It supports downscaling to a 0.9 km global resolution and processes sequences as long as 4.2 billion tokens. In benchmarks with 7 km resolution, ORBIT-2 demonstrates high accuracy, achieving R² scores between 0.98 and 0.99 compared to observation data. <div>

<div> Keywords: Graph Neural Networks, spectral filters, Piecewise Constant, heterophilic, polynomial filters

<br /><br />Summary: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in various applications by leveraging graph structures. Existing spectral GNNs utilize low-degree polynomial filters to capture spectral properties, but this approach can be limiting due to the small polynomial degree. Increasing the polynomial degree, although potentially beneficial, comes with high computational costs and can lead to performance plateaus or declines beyond certain thresholds. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a novel approach called the Piecewise Constant Spectral Graph Neural Network (PieCoN). PieCoN innovatively combines constant spectral filters with polynomial filters, enabling a more flexible utilization of graph structure. By adaptively segmenting the graph spectrum into intervals, PieCoN enhances the capacity to learn a broader range of spectral properties. The effectiveness of PieCoN is validated through experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Notably, PieCoN demonstrates exceptional performance on heterophilic datasets, indicating its potential for diverse applications across various fields. The findings suggest that PieCoN could represent a significant advancement in GNN methodologies, especially for datasets exhibiting heterophilic characteristics. <div>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success across various domains by leveraging graph structures in data. Existing spectral GNNs, which use low-degree polynomial filters to capture graph spectral properties, may not fully identify the graph's spectral characteristics because of the polynomial's small degree. However, increasing the polynomial degree is computationally expensive and beyond certain thresholds leads to performance plateaus or degradation. In this paper, we introduce the Piecewise Constant Spectral Graph Neural Network(PieCoN) to address these challenges. PieCoN combines constant spectral filters with polynomial filters to provide a more flexible way to leverage the graph structure. By adaptively partitioning the spectrum into intervals, our approach increases the range of spectral properties that can be effectively learned. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, demonstrate that PieCoN is particularly effective on heterophilic datasets, highlighting its potential for a wide range of applications.

<div> Keywords: Data imputation, quantum-inspired, PCA, optimization, healthcare  

<br /><br />Summary: This study presents a novel quantum-inspired data imputation framework specifically designed for datasets with missing or unreliable values, evaluated using the UCI Diabetes dataset. The framework integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with quantum-assisted rotations, utilizing gradient-free classical optimization techniques such as COBYLA, Simulated Annealing, and Differential Evolution. This innovative approach aims to reconstruct missing values while maintaining statistical fidelity. A unique feature of this method is the constraint of imputed values to within +/-2 standard deviations of the original feature distributions, effectively avoiding unrealistic clustering that often occurs with traditional imputation methods. The results demonstrate a significant improvement, achieving an average reduction of over 85% in Wasserstein distance, along with p-values between 0.18 and 0.22 in the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, compared to classical methods, which yield p-values exceeding 0.99. Additionally, the proposed framework eliminates zero-value artifacts and increases the realism and variability of imputed data. By merging quantum-inspired techniques with a scalable classical framework, the methodology presents a robust solution for data imputation, especially in fields where data quality and integrity are paramount, such as healthcare and AI applications. <div>

Abstract: Data imputation is a critical step in data pre-processing, particularly for datasets with missing or unreliable values. This study introduces a novel quantum-inspired imputation framework evaluated on the UCI Diabetes dataset, which contains biologically implausible missing values across several clinical features. The method integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with quantum-assisted rotations, optimized through gradient-free classical optimizers -COBYLA, Simulated Annealing, and Differential Evolution to reconstruct missing values while preserving statistical fidelity. Reconstructed values are constrained within +/-2 standard deviations of original feature distributions, avoiding unrealistic clustering around central tendencies. This approach achieves a substantial and statistically significant improvement, including an average reduction of over 85% in Wasserstein distance and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-values between 0.18 and 0.22, compared to p-values > 0.99 in classical methods such as Mean, KNN, and MICE. The method also eliminates zero-value artifacts and enhances the realism and variability of imputed data. By combining quantum-inspired transformations with a scalable classical framework, this methodology provides a robust solution for imputation tasks in domains such as healthcare and AI pipelines, where data quality and integrity are crucial.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, LLM, verification, value-function, MATH accuracy

<br /><br />Summary: The paper introduces RL$^V$, a novel approach that enhances traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods used for fine-tuning large language model (LLM) reasoners, like GRPO or Leave-one-out PPO. These existing methods often discard the learned value function, relying instead on empirically estimated returns, which complicates test-time compute scaling. RL$^V$ addresses this issue by allowing the LLM to simultaneously function as both a reasoner and a generative verifier, leveraging RL-generated data. The empirical results demonstrate that RL$^V$ significantly improves MATH accuracy by over 20%, while also enabling $8-32\times$ more efficient computation during test-time compared to standard RL techniques. Additionally, RL$^V$ showcases strong generalization abilities across varied task difficulties, transitioning smoothly from easy to hard and extending to out-of-domain challenges. The method further amplifies performance by 1.2-1.6 times when combining both parallel and sequential test-time compute with a long reasoning R1 model. Overall, RL$^V$ enhances the capability of LLMs in verification processes, providing a more robust framework for fine-tuning and execution. <div>

Abstract: Prevalent reinforcement learning~(RL) methods for fine-tuning LLM reasoners, such as GRPO or Leave-one-out PPO, abandon the learned value function in favor of empirically estimated returns. This hinders test-time compute scaling that relies on using the value-function for verification. In this work, we propose RL$^V$ that augments any ``value-free'' RL method by jointly training the LLM as both a reasoner and a generative verifier using RL-generated data, adding verification capabilities without significant overhead. Empirically, RL$^V$ boosts MATH accuracy by over 20\% with parallel sampling and enables $8-32\times$ efficient test-time compute scaling compared to the base RL method. RL$^V$ also exhibits strong generalization capabilities for both easy-to-hard and out-of-domain tasks. Furthermore, RL$^V$ achieves $1.2-1.6\times$ higher performance when jointly scaling parallel and sequential test-time compute with a long reasoning R1 model.

<div> Keywords: hallucination, LLM, summarization, FaithJudge, evaluation  

<br /><br />Summary: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in their responses even when provided with relevant context. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to minimize these hallucinations by grounding responses in context, yet models still often introduce misleading information or contradictions. This paper focuses on measuring LLM hallucinations specifically in summarization tasks, analyzing how various LLMs perform in summarizing documents. The study highlights Vectara's existing hallucination leaderboard, which is built on the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), and discusses the challenges this methodology faces as well as current hallucination detection techniques. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose FaithJudge, an innovative LLM-as-a-judge approach that utilizes few-shot human hallucination annotations. This new method significantly enhances automated evaluation of LLM hallucinations compared to existing methods. Additionally, the paper introduces an improved hallucination leaderboard centered around FaithJudge, in tandem with the current leaderboard, facilitating more reliable benchmarking of LLMs regarding hallucinations in the context of RAG. <div>

Abstract: Hallucinations remain a persistent challenge for LLMs. RAG aims to reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in contexts. However, even when provided context, LLMs still frequently introduce unsupported information or contradictions. This paper presents our efforts to measure LLM hallucinations with a focus on summarization tasks, assessing how often various LLMs introduce hallucinations when summarizing documents. We discuss Vectara's existing LLM hallucination leaderboard, based on the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM). While HHEM and Vectara's Hallucination Leaderboard have garnered great research interest, we examine challenges faced by HHEM and current hallucination detection methods by analyzing the effectiveness of these methods on existing hallucination datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge approach guided by few-shot human hallucination annotations, which substantially improves automated LLM hallucination evaluation over current methods. We introduce an enhanced hallucination leaderboard centered on FaithJudge, alongside our current hallucination leaderboard, enabling more reliable benchmarking of LLMs for hallucinations in RAG.

<title>PR2: Peephole Raw Pointer Rewriting with LLMs for Translating C to Safer Rust</title>

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in translating C code to Rust due to Rust's robust memory and thread safety guarantees. Tools such as C2RUST enable syntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code. However, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe constructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety guarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs generated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a peephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual functions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs decision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process. Additionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors introduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during compilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and evaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show that PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these projects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On average, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an average cost of $1.46.

Abstract: Learning bimanual manipulation is challenging due to its high dimensionality and tight coordination required between two arms. Eye-in-hand imitation learning, which uses wrist-mounted cameras, simplifies perception by focusing on task-relevant views. However, collecting diverse demonstrations remains costly, motivating the need for scalable data augmentation. While prior work has explored visual augmentation in single-arm settings, extending these approaches to bimanual manipulation requires generating viewpoint-consistent observations across both arms and producing corresponding action labels that are both valid and feasible. In this work, we propose Diffusion for COordinated Dual-arm Data Augmentation (D-CODA), a method for offline data augmentation tailored to eye-in-hand bimanual imitation learning that trains a diffusion model to synthesize novel, viewpoint-consistent wrist-camera images for both arms while simultaneously generating joint-space action labels. It employs constrained optimization to ensure that augmented states involving gripper-to-object contacts adhere to constraints suitable for bimanual coordination. We evaluate D-CODA on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2250 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that it outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable data augmentation in eye-in-hand bimanual manipulation.

Abstract: Existing methods for image alignment struggle in cases involving feature-sparse regions, extreme scale and field-of-view differences, and large deformations, often resulting in suboptimal accuracy. Robustness to these challenges improves through iterative refinement of the transformation field while focusing on critical regions in multi-scale image representations. We thus propose Auto-Regressive Transformation (ART), a novel method that iteratively estimates the coarse-to-fine transformations within an auto-regressive framework. Leveraging hierarchical multi-scale features, our network refines the transformations using randomly sampled points at each scale. By incorporating guidance from the cross-attention layer, the model focuses on critical regions, ensuring accurate alignment even in challenging, feature-limited conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that ART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a powerful new method for precise image alignment with broad applicability.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) in cyber physical systems (CPS) is a complex task due to the challenges that arise in terms of real-time decision making, safety, reliability, device heterogeneity, and data privacy. There are also open research questions that must be addressed in order to fully realize the potential of ML in CPS. Federated learning (FL), a distributed approach to ML, has become increasingly popular in recent years. It allows models to be trained using data from decentralized sources. This approach has been gaining popularity in the CPS field, as it integrates computer, communication, and physical processes. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the most recent developments of FL-CPS, including the numerous application areas, system topologies, and algorithms developed in recent years. The paper starts by discussing recent advances in both FL and CPS, followed by their integration. Then, the paper compares the application of FL in CPS with its applications in the internet of things (IoT) in further depth to show their connections and distinctions. Furthermore, the article scrutinizes how FL is utilized in critical CPS applications, e.g., intelligent transportation systems, cybersecurity services, smart cities, and smart healthcare solutions. The study also includes critical insights and lessons learned from various FL-CPS implementations. The paper's concluding section delves into significant concerns and suggests avenues for further research in this fast-paced and dynamic era.

Abstract: Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) has become an essential technique for optimizing neural network by determining the optimal bitwidth per layer. Existing MPQ methods, however, face a major hurdle: they require a computationally expensive search for quantization policies on large-scale datasets. To resolve this issue, we introduce a novel approach that first searches for quantization policies on small datasets and then generalizes them to large-scale datasets. This approach simplifies the process, eliminating the need for large-scale quantization fine-tuning and only necessitating model weight adjustment. Our method is characterized by three key techniques: sharpness-aware minimization for enhanced quantization generalization, implicit gradient direction alignment to handle gradient conflicts among different optimization objectives, and an adaptive perturbation radius to accelerate optimization. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate our approach. Using the CIFAR10 dataset (just 0.5\% the size of ImageNet training data) for MPQ policy search, we achieved equivalent accuracy on ImageNet with a significantly lower computational cost, while improving efficiency by up to 150% over the baselines.

Abstract: Quantum computing offers theoretical advantages over classical computing for specific tasks, yet the boundary of practical quantum advantage remains an open question. To investigate this boundary, it is crucial to understand whether, and how, classical machines can learn and simulate quantum algorithms. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong reasoning abilities, prompting exploration into their potential for this challenge. In this work, we introduce GroverGPT-2, an LLM-based method for simulating Grover's algorithm using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and quantum-native tokenization. Building on its predecessor, GroverGPT-2 performs simulation directly from quantum circuit representations while producing logically structured and interpretable outputs. Our results show that GroverGPT-2 can learn and internalize quantum circuit logic through efficient processing of quantum-native tokens, providing direct evidence that classical models like LLMs can capture the structure of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, GroverGPT-2 outputs interleave circuit data with natural language, embedding explicit reasoning into the simulation. This dual capability positions GroverGPT-2 as a prototype for advancing machine understanding of quantum algorithms and modeling quantum circuit logic. We also identify an empirical scaling law for GroverGPT-2 with increasing qubit numbers, suggesting a path toward scalable classical simulation. These findings open new directions for exploring the limits of classical simulatability, enhancing quantum education and research, and laying groundwork for future foundation models in quantum computing.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) perform strongly in complex reasoning tasks via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but often suffer from verbose outputs caused by redundant content, increasing computational overhead, and degrading user experience. Existing compression methods either operate post-hoc pruning, risking disruption to reasoning coherence, or rely on sampling-based selection, which fails to intervene effectively during generation. In this work, we introduce a confidence-guided perspective to explain the emergence of redundant reflection in LRMs, identifying two key patterns: Confidence Deficit, where the model reconsiders correct steps due to low internal confidence, and Termination Delay, where reasoning continues even after reaching a confident answer. Based on this analysis, we propose ConCISE (Confidence-guided Compression In Step-by-step Efficient Reasoning), a framework that simplifies reasoning chains by reinforcing the model's confidence during inference, thus preventing the generation of redundant reflection steps. It integrates Confidence Injection to stabilize intermediate steps and Early Stopping to terminate reasoning when confidence is sufficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LRMs on ConCISE-generated data yields significantly shorter outputs, reducing length by up to approximately 50% under SimPO, while maintaining high task accuracy. ConCISE consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Retrieval of legal knowledge by the general public is a challenging problem due to the technicality of the professional knowledge and the lack of fundamental understanding by laypersons on the subject. Traditional information retrieval techniques assume that users are capable of formulating succinct and precise queries for effective document retrieval. In practice, however, the wide gap between the highly technical contents and untrained users makes legal knowledge retrieval very difficult. We propose a methodology, called QBR, which employs a Questions Bank (QB) as an effective medium for bridging the knowledge gap. We show how the QB is used to derive training samples to enhance the embedding of knowledge units within documents, which leads to effective fine-grained knowledge retrieval. We discuss and evaluate through experiments various advantages of QBR over traditional methods. These include more accurate, efficient, and explainable document retrieval, better comprehension of retrieval results, and highly effective fine-grained knowledge retrieval. We also present some case studies and show that QBR achieves social impact by assisting citizens to resolve everyday legal concerns.

Abstract: Remarkable advancements in generative AI technology have given rise to a spectrum of novel deepfake categories with unprecedented leaps in their realism, and deepfakes are increasingly becoming a nuisance to law enforcement authorities and the general public. In particular, we observe alarming levels of confusion, deception, and loss of faith regarding multimedia content within society caused by face deepfakes, and existing deepfake detectors are struggling to keep up with the pace of improvements in deepfake generation. This is primarily due to their reliance on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to generalise and detect novel deepfake types. To combat the spread of malicious face deepfakes, this paper proposes a new strategy that leverages coarse-to-fine spatial information, semantic information, and their interactions while ensuring feature distinctiveness and reducing the redundancy of the modelled features. A novel feature orthogonality-based disentanglement strategy is introduced to ensure branch-level and cross-branch feature disentanglement, which allows us to integrate multiple feature vectors without adding complexity to the feature space or compromising generalisation. Comprehensive experiments on three public benchmarks: FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) show that these design choices enable the proposed approach to outperform current state-of-the-art methods by 5% on the Celeb-DF dataset and 7% on the DFDC dataset in a cross-dataset evaluation setting.

<title>Clustering with Communication: A Variational Framework for Single Cell Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed complex cellular heterogeneity, but recent studies emphasize that understanding biological function also requires modeling cell-cell communication (CCC), the signaling interactions mediated by ligand-receptor pairs that coordinate cellular behavior. Tools like CellChat have demonstrated that CCC plays a critical role in processes such as cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and immune response, and that transcriptomic data inherently encodes rich information about intercellular signaling. We propose CCCVAE, a novel variational autoencoder framework that incorporates CCC signals into single-cell representation learning. By leveraging a communication-aware kernel derived from ligand-receptor interactions and a sparse Gaussian process, CCCVAE encodes biologically informed priors into the latent space. Unlike conventional VAEs that treat each cell independently, CCCVAE encourages latent embeddings to reflect both transcriptional similarity and intercellular signaling context. Empirical results across four scRNA-seq datasets show that CCCVAE improves clustering performance, achieving higher evaluation scores than standard VAE baselines. This work demonstrates the value of embedding biological priors into deep generative models for unsupervised single-cell analysis.

arXiv:2505.04898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first precise distributional characterization of gradient descent iterates for general multi-layer neural networks under the canonical single-index regression model, in the `finite-width proportional regime' where the sample size and feature dimension grow proportionally while the network width and depth remain bounded. Our non-asymptotic state evolution theory captures Gaussian fluctuations in first-layer weights and concentration in deeper-layer weights, and remains valid for non-Gaussian features.
  Our theory differs from existing neural tangent kernel (NTK), mean-field (MF) theories and tensor program (TP) in several key aspects. First, our theory operates in the finite-width regime whereas these existing theories are fundamentally infinite-width. Second, our theory allows weights to evolve from individual initializations beyond the lazy training regime, whereas NTK and MF are either frozen at or only weakly sensitive to initialization, and TP relies on special initialization schemes. Third, our theory characterizes both training and generalization errors for general multi-layer neural networks beyond the uniform convergence regime, whereas existing theories study generalization almost exclusively in two-layer settings.
  As a statistical application, we show that vanilla gradient descent can be augmented to yield consistent estimates of the generalization error at each iteration, which can be used to guide early stopping and hyperparameter tuning. As a further theoretical implication, we show that despite model misspecification, the model learned by gradient descent retains the structure of a single-index function with an effective signal determined by a linear combination of the true signal and the initialization.

Abstract: This study introduces SpatialPrompting, a novel framework that harnesses the emergent reasoning capabilities of off-the-shelf multimodal large language models to achieve zero-shot spatial reasoning in three-dimensional (3D) environments. Unlike existing methods that rely on expensive 3D-specific fine-tuning with specialized 3D inputs such as point clouds or voxel-based features, SpatialPrompting employs a keyframe-driven prompt generation strategy. This framework uses metrics such as vision-language similarity, Mahalanobis distance, field of view, and image sharpness to select a diverse and informative set of keyframes from image sequences and then integrates them with corresponding camera pose data to effectively abstract spatial relationships and infer complex 3D structures. The proposed framework not only establishes a new paradigm for flexible spatial reasoning that utilizes intuitive visual and positional cues but also achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on benchmark datasets, such as ScanQA and SQA3D, across several metrics. The proposed method effectively eliminates the need for specialized 3D inputs and fine-tuning, offering a simpler and more scalable alternative to conventional approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI have catalyzed the adoption of intelligent educational tools, yet many semantic retrieval systems remain ill-suited to the unique linguistic and structural characteristics of academic content. This study presents two open-source embedding models fine-tuned for educational question answering, particularly in the context of course syllabi. A synthetic dataset of 3,197 sentence pairs, spanning synonymous terminology, paraphrased questions, and implicit-explicit mappings, was constructed through a combination of manual curation and large language model (LLM)-assisted generation. Two training strategies were evaluated: (1) a baseline model fine-tuned using MultipleNegativesRankingLoss (MNRL), and (2) a dual-loss model that combines MNRL with CosineSimilarityLoss to improve both semantic ranking and similarity calibration. Evaluations were conducted on 28 university course syllabi using a fixed set of natural language questions categorized into course, faculty, and teaching assistant information. Results demonstrate that both fine-tuned models outperform strong open-source baselines, including all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1, and that the dual-loss model narrows the performance gap with high-performing proprietary embeddings such as OpenAI's text-embedding-3 series. This work contributes reusable, domain-aligned embedding models and provides a replicable framework for educational semantic retrieval, supporting downstream applications such as academic chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and learning management system (LMS) integrations.

Abstract: Although deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable potential in weather prediction, most of them overlook either the \textbf{physics} of the underlying weather evolution or the \textbf{topology} of the Earth's surface. In light of these disadvantages, we develop PASSAT, a novel Physics-ASSisted And Topology-informed deep learning model for weather prediction. PASSAT attributes the weather evolution to two key factors: (i) the advection process that can be characterized by the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes equation; (ii) the Earth-atmosphere interaction that is difficult to both model and calculate. PASSAT also takes the topology of the Earth's surface into consideration, other than simply treating it as a plane. With these considerations, PASSAT numerically solves the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes equation on the spherical manifold, utilizes a spherical graph neural network to capture the Earth-atmosphere interaction, and generates the initial velocity fields that are critical to solving the advection equation from the same spherical graph neural network. In the $5.625^\circ$-resolution ERA5 data set, PASSAT outperforms both the state-of-the-art deep learning-based weather prediction models and the operational numerical weather prediction model IFS T42. Code and checkpoint are available at https://github.com/Yumenomae/PASSAT_5p625.

Abstract: Trustworthy depression prediction based on deep learning, incorporating both predictive reliability and algorithmic fairness across diverse demographic groups, is crucial for clinical application. Recently, achieving reliable depression predictions through uncertainty quantification has attracted increasing attention. However, few studies have focused on the fairness of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in depression prediction. In this work, we investigate the algorithmic fairness of UQ, namely Equal Opportunity Coverage (EOC) fairness, and propose Fair Uncertainty Quantification (FUQ) for depression prediction. FUQ pursues reliable and fair depression predictions through group-based analysis. Specifically, we first group all the participants by different sensitive attributes and leverage conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty within each demographic group, which provides a theoretically guaranteed and valid way to quantify uncertainty for depression prediction and facilitates the investigation of fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose a fairness-aware optimization strategy that formulates fairness as a constrained optimization problem under EOC constraints. This enables the model to preserve predictive reliability while adapting to the heterogeneous uncertainty levels across demographic groups, thereby achieving optimal fairness. Through extensive evaluations on several visual and audio depression datasets, our approach demonstrates its effectiveness.

Abstract: While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have become increasingly popular across various scientific disciplines for their ability to model and interlink huge quantities of data, essentially all real-world KGs are known to be incomplete. As such, with the growth of KG use has been a concurrent development of machine learning tools designed to predict missing information in KGs, which is referred to as the Link Prediction Task. The majority of state-of-the-art link predictors to date have followed an embedding-based paradigm. In this paradigm, it is assumed that the information content of a KG is best represented by the (individual) vector representations of its nodes and edges, and that therefore node and edge embeddings are particularly well-suited to performing link prediction.
  This thesis proposes an alternative perspective on the field's approach to link prediction and KG data modelling. Specifically, this work re-analyses KGs and state-of-the-art link predictors from a graph-structure-first perspective that models the information content of a KG in terms of whole triples, rather than individual nodes and edges.
  Following a literature review and two core sets of experiments, this thesis concludes that a structure-first perspective on KGs and link prediction is both viable and useful for understanding KG learning and for enabling cross-KG transfer learning for the link prediction task. This observation is used to create and propose the Structural Alignment Hypothesis, which postulates that link prediction can be understood and modelled as a structural task.
  All code and data used for this thesis are open-sourced. This thesis was written bilingually, with the main document in English and an informal extended summary in Irish. An Irish-language translation dictionary of machine learning terms (the Focl\'oir Tr\'achtais) created for this work is open-sourced as well.

Abstract: Thanks to recent advancements in scalable deep architectures and large-scale pretraining, text-to-video generation has achieved unprecedented capabilities in producing high-fidelity, instruction-following content across a wide range of styles, enabling applications in advertising, entertainment, and education. However, these models' ability to render precise on-screen text, such as captions or mathematical formulas, remains largely untested, posing significant challenges for applications requiring exact textual accuracy. In this work, we introduce T2VTextBench, the first human-evaluation benchmark dedicated to evaluating on-screen text fidelity and temporal consistency in text-to-video models. Our suite of prompts integrates complex text strings with dynamic scene changes, testing each model's ability to maintain detailed instructions across frames. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art systems, ranging from open-source solutions to commercial offerings, and find that most struggle to generate legible, consistent text. These results highlight a critical gap in current video generators and provide a clear direction for future research aimed at enhancing textual manipulation in video synthesis.

Abstract: Chain-of-thoughts (CoT) requires large language models (LLMs) to generate intermediate steps before reaching the final answer, and has been proven effective to help LLMs solve complex reasoning tasks. However, the inner mechanism of CoT still remains largely unclear. In this paper, we empirically study the role of CoT tokens in LLMs on two compositional tasks: multi-digit multiplication and dynamic programming. While CoT is essential for solving these problems, we find that preserving only tokens that store intermediate results would achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, we observe that storing intermediate results in an alternative latent form will not affect model performance. We also randomly intervene some values in CoT, and notice that subsequent CoT tokens and the final answer would change correspondingly. These findings suggest that CoT tokens may function like variables in computer programs but with potential drawbacks like unintended shortcuts and computational complexity limits between tokens. The code and data are available at https://github.com/solitaryzero/CoTs_are_Variables.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), widely recognized for their potential to generate high-quality samples, tend to go unnoticed in representation learning. While recent progress has highlighted their potential for capturing visual semantics, adapting DPMs to graph representation learning remains in its infancy. In this paper, we introduce Graffe, a self-supervised diffusion model proposed for graph representation learning. It features a graph encoder that distills a source graph into a compact representation, which, in turn, serves as the condition to guide the denoising process of the diffusion decoder. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we first explore the theoretical foundations of applying diffusion models to representation learning, proving that the denoising objective implicitly maximizes the conditional mutual information between data and its representation. Specifically, we prove that the negative logarithm of the denoising score matching loss is a tractable lower bound for the conditional mutual information. Empirically, we conduct a series of case studies to validate our theoretical insights. In addition, Graffe delivers competitive results under the linear probing setting on node and graph classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 9 of the 11 real-world datasets. These findings indicate that powerful generative models, especially diffusion models, serve as an effective tool for graph representation learning.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems, which require the simultaneous optimization of multiple terms, are prevalent across numerous applications. Existing multi-objective optimization methods often rely on manually tuned aggregation functions to formulate a joint optimization target. The performance of such hand-tuned methods is heavily dependent on careful weight selection, a time-consuming and laborious process. These limitations also arise in the setting of reinforcement-learning-based motion tracking for physically simulated characters, where intricately crafted reward functions are typically used to achieve high-fidelity results. Such solutions not only require domain expertise and significant manual adjustment, but also limit the applicability of the resulting reward function across diverse skills. To bridge this gap, we present a novel adversarial multi-objective optimization technique that is broadly applicable to a range of multi-objective optimization problems, including motion tracking. The proposed adversarial differential discriminator receives a single positive sample, yet is still effective at guiding the optimization process. We demonstrate that our technique can enable characters to closely replicate a variety of acrobatic and agile behaviors, achieving comparable quality to state-of-the-art motion-tracking methods, without relying on manually tuned reward functions.

Abstract: The moments of random variables are fundamental statistical measures for characterizing the shape of a probability distribution, encompassing metrics such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Additionally, the product moments, including covariance and correlation, reveal the relationships between multiple random variables. On the other hand, the primary focus of causal inference is the evaluation of causal effects, which are defined as the difference between two potential outcomes. While traditional causal effect assessment focuses on the average causal effect, this work provides definitions, identification theorems, and bounds for moments and product moments of causal effects to analyze their distribution and relationships. We conduct experiments to illustrate the estimation of the moments of causal effects from finite samples and demonstrate their practical application using a real-world medical dataset.

Abstract: The miniaturisation of sensors and processors, the advancements in connected edge intelligence, and the exponential interest in Artificial Intelligence are boosting the affirmation of autonomous nano-size drones in the Internet of Robotic Things ecosystem. However, achieving safe autonomous navigation and high-level tasks such as exploration and surveillance with these tiny platforms is extremely challenging due to their limited resources. This work focuses on enabling the safe and autonomous flight of a pocket-size, 30-gram platform called Crazyflie 2.1 in a partially known environment. We propose a novel AI-aided, vision-based reactive planning method for obstacle avoidance under the ambit of Integrated Sensing, Computing and Communication paradigm. We deal with the constraints of the nano-drone by splitting the navigation task into two parts: a deep learning-based object detector runs on the edge (external hardware) while the planning algorithm is executed onboard. The results show the ability to command the drone at $\sim8$ frames-per-second and a model performance reaching a COCO mean-average-precision of $60.8$. Field experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the solution with the drone flying at a top speed of $1$ m/s while steering away from an obstacle placed in an unknown position and reaching the target destination. The outcome highlights the compatibility of the communication delay and the model performance with the requirements of the real-time navigation task. We provide a feasible alternative to a fully onboard implementation that can be extended to autonomous exploration with nano-drones.

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of deep neural network (DNN) models, dynamic watermarking techniques are being used to protect the intellectual property of model owners. However, recent studies have shown that existing watermarking schemes are vulnerable to watermark removal and ambiguity attacks. Besides, the vague criteria for determining watermark presence further increase the likelihood of such attacks. In this paper, we propose a secure DNN watermarking scheme named ChainMarks, which generates secure and robust watermarks by introducing a cryptographic chain into the trigger inputs and utilizes a two-phase Monte Carlo method for determining watermark presence. First, ChainMarks generates trigger inputs as a watermark dataset by repeatedly applying a hash function over a secret key, where the target labels associated with trigger inputs are generated from the digital signature of model owner. Then, the watermarked model is produced by training a DNN over both the original and watermark datasets. To verify watermarks, we compare the predicted labels of trigger inputs with the target labels and determine ownership with a more accurate decision threshold that considers the classification probability of specific models. Experimental results show that ChainMarks exhibits higher levels of robustness and security compared to state-of-the-art watermarking schemes. With a better marginal utility, ChainMarks provides a higher probability guarantee of watermark presence in DNN models with the same level of watermark accuracy.

Abstract: Mediation analysis for probabilities of causation (PoC) provides a fundamental framework for evaluating the necessity and sufficiency of treatment in provoking an event through different causal pathways. One of the primary objectives of causal mediation analysis is to decompose the total effect into path-specific components. In this study, we investigate the path-specific probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS) to decompose the total PNS into path-specific components along distinct causal pathways between treatment and outcome, incorporating two mediators. We define the path-specific PNS for decomposition and provide an identification theorem. Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments to assess the properties of the proposed estimators from finite samples and demonstrate their practical application using a real-world educational dataset.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a pivotal capability of auto-regressive large language models, yet it is hindered by a notable sensitivity to the ordering of context examples regardless of their mutual independence. To address this issue, recent studies have introduced several variant algorithms of ICL that achieve permutation invariance. However, many of these do not exhibit comparable performance with the standard auto-regressive ICL algorithm. In this work, we identify two crucial elements in the design of an invariant ICL algorithm: information non-leakage and context interdependence, which are not simultaneously achieved by any of the existing methods. These investigations lead us to the proposed Invariant ICL (InvICL), a methodology designed to achieve invariance in ICL while ensuring the two properties. Empirically, our findings reveal that InvICL surpasses previous models, both invariant and non-invariant, in most benchmark datasets, showcasing superior generalization capabilities across varying input lengths. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/InvICL.

<title>StabStitch++: Unsupervised Online Video Stitching with Spatiotemporal Bidirectional Warps</title>

Abstract: We retarget video stitching to an emerging issue, named warping shake, which unveils the temporal content shakes induced by sequentially unsmooth warps when extending image stitching to video stitching. Even if the input videos are stable, the stitched video can inevitably cause undesired warping shakes and affect the visual experience. To address this issue, we propose StabStitch++, a novel video stitching framework to realize spatial stitching and temporal stabilization with unsupervised learning simultaneously. First, different from existing learning-based image stitching solutions that typically warp one image to align with another, we suppose a virtual midplane between original image planes and project them onto it. Concretely, we design a differentiable bidirectional decomposition module to disentangle the homography transformation and incorporate it into our spatial warp, evenly spreading alignment burdens and projective distortions across two views. Then, inspired by camera paths in video stabilization, we derive the mathematical expression of stitching trajectories in video stitching by elaborately integrating spatial and temporal warps. Finally, a warp smoothing model is presented to produce stable stitched videos with a hybrid loss to simultaneously encourage content alignment, trajectory smoothness, and online collaboration. Compared with StabStitch that sacrifices alignment for stabilization, StabStitch++ makes no compromise and optimizes both of them simultaneously, especially in the online mode. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, we build a video stitching dataset with a rich diversity in camera motions and scenes. Experiments exhibit that StabStitch++ surpasses current solutions in stitching performance, robustness, and efficiency, offering compelling advancements in this field by building a real-time online video stitching system.

Abstract: Continuous authentication systems leveraging free-text keyboard dynamics offer a promising additional layer of security in a multifactor authentication setup that can be used in a transparent way with no impact on user experience. This study investigates the efficacy of behavioral biometrics by employing an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate diverse typing profiles across mechanical and membrane keyboards. Specifically, we generated synthetic keystroke data from five unique agents, capturing features related to dwell time, flight time, and error rates within sliding 5-second windows updated every second. Two machine learning approaches, One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) and Random Forest (RF), were evaluated for user verification. Results revealed a stark contrast in performance: while One-Class SVM failed to differentiate individual users within each group, Random Forest achieved robust intra-keyboard user recognition (Accuracy > 0.7) but struggled to generalize across keyboards for the same user, highlighting the significant impact of keyboard hardware on typing behavior. These findings suggest that: (1) keyboard-specific user profiles may be necessary for reliable authentication, and (2) ensemble methods like RF outperform One-Class SVM in capturing fine-grained user-specific patterns.

<title>Generating Reliable Synthetic Clinical Trial Data: The Role of Hyperparameter Optimization and Domain Constraints</title>

Abstract: The generation of synthetic clinical trial data offers a promising approach to mitigating privacy concerns and data accessibility limitations in medical research. However, ensuring that synthetic datasets maintain high fidelity, utility, and adherence to domain-specific constraints remains a key challenge. While hyperparameter optimization (HPO) has been shown to improve generative model performance, the effectiveness of different optimization strategies for synthetic clinical data remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates four HPO strategies across eight generative models, comparing single-metric optimization against compound metric optimization approaches. Our results demonstrate that HPO consistently improves synthetic data quality, with TVAE, CTGAN, and CTAB-GAN+ achieving improvements of up to 60%, 39%, and 38%, respectively. Compound metric optimization outperformed single-metric strategies, producing more balanced and generalizable synthetic datasets. Interestingly, HPO alone is insufficient to ensure clinically valid synthetic data, as all models exhibited violations of fundamental survival constraints. Preprocessing and postprocessing played a crucial role in reducing these violations, as models lacking robust processing steps produced invalid data in up to 61% of cases. These findings underscore the necessity of integrating explicit domain knowledge alongside HPO to create high quality synthetic datasets. Our study provides actionable recommendations for improving synthetic data generation, with future research needed to refine metric selection and validate these findings on larger datasets to enhance clinical applicability.

In this work, we explore how multilingual vision-language models tackle the task of image-text relation prediction in different languages, and construct a dedicated balanced benchmark data set from Twitter posts in Latvian along with their manual translations into English. We compare our results to previous work and show that the more recently released vision-language model checkpoints are becoming increasingly capable at this task, but there is still much room for further improvement.

<title>Direct Image Classification from Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy Measurements without Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: The computational imaging technique of Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) enables high-resolution imaging with a wide field of view and can serve as an extremely valuable tool, e.g. in the classification of cells in medical applications. However, reconstructing a high-resolution image from tens or even hundreds of measurements is computationally expensive, particularly for a wide field of view. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the idea of classifying the image content in the FPM measurements directly without performing a reconstruction step first. We show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can extract meaningful information from measurement sequences, significantly outperforming the classification on a single band-limited image (up to 12 %) while being significantly more efficient than a reconstruction of a high-resolution image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a learned multiplexing of several raw measurements allows maintaining the classification accuracy while reducing the amount of data (and consequently also the acquisition time) significantly.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available Teochew dataset with accurate orthographic annotations. We conduct experiments on the corpus, and the results validate its effectiveness in ASR and TTS tasks.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in multimodal tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification but struggles with fine-grained understanding due to its focus on coarse-grained short captions. To address this, we propose Fine-Grained CLIP (FG-CLIP), which enhances fine-grained understanding through three key innovations. First, we leverage large multimodal models to generate 1.6 billion long caption-image pairs for capturing global-level semantic details. Second, a high-quality dataset is constructed with 12 million images and 40 million region-specific bounding boxes aligned with detailed captions to ensure precise, context-rich representations. Third, 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples are incorporated to improve the model's ability to distinguish subtle semantic differences. Corresponding training methods are meticulously designed for these data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FG-CLIP outperforms the original CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks, including fine-grained understanding, open-vocabulary object detection, image-text retrieval, and general multimodal benchmarks. These results highlight FG-CLIP's effectiveness in capturing fine-grained image details and improving overall model performance. The related data, code, and models are available at https://github.com/360CVGroup/FG-CLIP.

Abstract: On-device learning has emerged as a promising direction for AI development, particularly because of its potential to reduce latency issues and mitigate privacy risks associated with device-server communication, while improving energy efficiency. Despite these advantages, significant memory and computational constraints still represent major challenges for its deployment. Drawing on previous studies on low-rank decomposition methods that address activation memory bottlenecks in backpropagation, we propose a novel shortcut approach as an alternative. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that our method can reduce activation memory usage, even up to $120.09\times$ compared to vanilla training, while also reducing overall training FLOPs up to $1.86\times$ when evaluated on traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: This study explores a novel approach to neural network pruning using evolutionary computation, focusing on simultaneously pruning the encoder and decoder of an autoencoder. We introduce two new mutation operators that use layer activations to guide weight pruning. Our findings reveal that one of these activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in more efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained models. Prior work has established that autoencoder training is effective and scalable with a spatial coevolutionary algorithm that cooperatively coevolves a population of encoders with a population of decoders, rather than one autoencoder. We evaluate how the same activity-guided mutation operators transfer to this context. We find that random pruning is better than guided pruning, in the coevolutionary setting. This suggests activation-based guidance proves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where constrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in randomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by expanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform randomness that better preserves system dynamics. We experiment with pruning according to different schedules and present best combinations of operator and schedule for the canonical and coevolving populations cases.

Abstract: To perform in-context learning, language models must extract signals from individual few-shot examples, aggregate these into a learned prediction rule, and then apply this rule to new examples. How is this implemented in the forward pass of modern transformer models? To study this, we consider a structured family of few-shot learning tasks for which the true prediction rule is to add an integer $k$ to the input. We find that Llama-3-8B attains high accuracy on this task for a range of $k$, and localize its few-shot ability to just three attention heads via a novel optimization approach. We further show the extracted signals lie in a six-dimensional subspace, where four of the dimensions track the unit digit and the other two dimensions track overall magnitude. We finally examine how these heads extract information from individual few-shot examples, identifying a self-correction mechanism in which mistakes from earlier examples are suppressed by later examples. Our results demonstrate how tracking low-dimensional subspaces across a forward pass can provide insight into fine-grained computational structures.

Abstract: Small and medium sized businesses often struggle with data driven decision making do to a lack of advanced analytics tools, especially in African countries where they make up a majority of the workforce. Though many tools exist they are not designed to fit into the ways of working of SMB workers who are mobile first, have limited time to learn new workflows, and for whom social and business are tightly coupled. To address this, the Dukawalla prototype was created. This intelligent assistant bridges the gap between raw business data, and actionable insights by leveraging voice interaction and the power of generative AI. Dukawalla provides an intuitive way for business owners to interact with their data, aiding in informed decision making.

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the cornerstone of deep learning, but its reliance on global gradient synchronization limits scalability and imposes significant memory overhead. We propose Stochastic Variational Propagation (SVP), a scalable alternative that reframes training as hierarchical variational inference. SVP treats layer activations as latent variables and optimizes local Evidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs), enabling independent, local updates while preserving global coherence. However, directly applying KL divergence in layer-wise ELBOs risks inter-layer's representation collapse due to excessive compression. To prevent this, SVP projects activations into low-dimensional spaces via fixed random matrices, ensuring information preservation and representational diversity. Combined with a feature alignment loss for inter-layer consistency, SVP achieves competitive accuracy with BP across diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) and datasets (MNIST to ImageNet), reduces memory usage by up to 4x, and significantly improves scalability. More broadly, SVP introduces a probabilistic perspective to deep representation learning, opening pathways toward more modular and interpretable neural network design.

Abstract: Prompt learning is one of the most effective paradigms for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to the biomedical image classification tasks in few shot scenarios. However, most of the current prompt learning methods only used the text prompts and ignored the particular structures (such as the complex anatomical structures and subtle pathological features) in the biomedical images. In this work, we propose Biomed-DPT, a knowledge-enhanced dual modality prompt tuning technique. In designing the text prompt, Biomed-DPT constructs a dual prompt including the template-driven clinical prompts and the large language model (LLM)-driven domain-adapted prompts, then extracts the clinical knowledge from the domain-adapted prompts through the knowledge distillation technique. In designing the vision prompt, Biomed-DPT introduces the zero vector as a soft prompt to leverage attention re-weighting so that the focus on non-diagnostic regions and the recognition of non-critical pathological features are avoided. Biomed-DPT achieves an average classification accuracy of 66.14\% across 11 biomedical image datasets covering 9 modalities and 10 organs, with performance reaching 78.06\% in base classes and 75.97\% in novel classes, surpassing the Context Optimization (CoOp) method by 6.20\%, 3.78\%, and 8.04\%, respectively.

Abstract: Text watermarking aims to subtly embed statistical signals into text by controlling the Large Language Model (LLM)'s sampling process, enabling watermark detectors to verify that the output was generated by the specified model. The robustness of these watermarking algorithms has become a key factor in evaluating their effectiveness. Current text watermarking algorithms embed watermarks in high-entropy tokens to ensure text quality. In this paper, we reveal that this seemingly benign design can be exploited by attackers, posing a significant risk to the robustness of the watermark. We introduce a generic efficient paraphrasing attack, the Self-Information Rewrite Attack (SIRA), which leverages the vulnerability by calculating the self-information of each token to identify potential pattern tokens and perform targeted attack. Our work exposes a widely prevalent vulnerability in current watermarking algorithms. The experimental results show SIRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates on seven recent watermarking methods with only 0.88 USD per million tokens cost. Our approach does not require any access to the watermark algorithms or the watermarked LLM and can seamlessly transfer to any LLM as the attack model, even mobile-level models. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more robust watermarking.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by explaining predictions through human-understandable concepts but typically assume that training and test data share the same distribution. This assumption often fails under domain shifts, leading to degraded performance and poor generalization. To address these limitations and improve the robustness of CBMs, we propose the Concept-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CUDA) framework. CUDA is designed to: (1) align concept representations across domains using adversarial training, (2) introduce a relaxation threshold to allow minor domain-specific differences in concept distributions, thereby preventing performance drop due to over-constraints of these distributions, (3) infer concepts directly in the target domain without requiring labeled concept data, enabling CBMs to adapt to diverse domains, and (4) integrate concept learning into conventional domain adaptation (DA) with theoretical guarantees, improving interpretability and establishing new benchmarks for DA. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CBM and DA methods on real-world datasets.

Abstract: With the high penetration of renewables, traditional model-based power system operation is challenged to deliver economic, stable, and robust decisions. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful modeling tool for capturing complex dynamics to address these challenges. However, its separate design often lacks systematic integration with existing methods. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations (LAPSO, pronounced as Lap-So). Adopting a native optimization perspective, LAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to break the boundary between temporally siloed power system tasks, such as forecast, operation and control, while unifying the objectives of machine learning and model-based optimizations at both training and inference stages. Systematic analysis and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of applying LAPSO in designing new integrated algorithms, such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and objective-based forecasting (OBF), while enabling end-to-end tracing of different sources of uncertainties. In addition, a dedicated Python package-lapso is introduced to automatically augment existing power system optimization models with learnable components.

Abstract: The article explores the emerging domain of incentive-aware machine learning (ML), which focuses on algorithmic decision-making in contexts where individuals can strategically modify their inputs to influence outcomes. It categorizes the research into three perspectives: robustness, aiming to design models resilient to "gaming"; fairness, analyzing the societal impacts of such systems; and improvement/causality, recognizing situations where strategic actions lead to genuine personal or societal improvement. The paper introduces a unified framework encapsulating models for these perspectives, including offline, online, and causal settings, and highlights key challenges such as differentiating between gaming and improvement and addressing heterogeneity among agents. By synthesizing findings from diverse works, we outline theoretical advancements and practical solutions for robust, fair, and causally-informed incentive-aware ML systems.

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter optimization (CASH) is a challenging resource allocation problem in the field of AutoML. We propose MaxUCB, a max $k$-armed bandit method to trade off exploring different model classes and conducting hyperparameter optimization. MaxUCB is specifically designed for the light-tailed and bounded reward distributions arising in this setting and, thus, provides an efficient alternative compared to classic max $k$-armed bandit methods assuming heavy-tailed reward distributions. We theoretically and empirically evaluate our method on four standard AutoML benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over prior approaches.

Abstract: Learning to cooperate in distributed partially observable environments with no communication abilities poses significant challenges for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). This paper addresses key concerns in this domain, focusing on inferring state representations from individual agent observations and leveraging these representations to enhance agents' exploration and collaborative task execution policies. To this end, we propose a novel state modelling framework for cooperative MARL, where agents infer meaningful belief representations of the non-observable state, with respect to optimizing their own policies, while filtering redundant and less informative joint state information. Building upon this framework, we propose the MARL SMPE algorithm. In SMPE, agents enhance their own policy's discriminative abilities under partial observability, explicitly by incorporating their beliefs into the policy network, and implicitly by adopting an adversarial type of exploration policies which encourages agents to discover novel, high-value states while improving the discriminative abilities of others. Experimentally, we show that SMPE outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in complex fully cooperative tasks from the MPE, LBF, and RWARE benchmarks.

<title>T-T: Table Transformer for Tagging-based Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction</title>

Abstract: Aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) aims to extract triplets composed of aspect terms, opinion terms, and sentiment polarities from given sentences. The table tagging method is a popular approach to addressing this task, which encodes a sentence into a 2-dimensional table, allowing for the tagging of relations between any two words. Previous efforts have focused on designing various downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions between tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture relations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we attempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning modules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it is foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to the quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the input sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges: overly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the tagging-based ASTE method. Specifically, we introduce a stripe attention mechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former modifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local attention window, while the latter facilitates interaction between different attention windows. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the T-T, as a downstream relation learning module, achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower computational costs.

Abstract: Code large language models (CodeLLMs) and agents have shown great promise in tackling complex software engineering tasks.Compared to traditional software engineering methods, CodeLLMs and agents offer stronger abilities, and can flexibly process inputs and outputs in both natural and code. Benchmarking plays a crucial role in evaluating the capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents, guiding their development and deployment. However, despite their growing significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews of benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of existing benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents, studying and analyzing 181 benchmarks from 461 relevant papers, covering the different phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Our findings reveal a notable imbalance in the coverage of current benchmarks, with approximately 60% focused on the software development phase in SDLC, while requirements engineering and software design phases receive minimal attention at only 5% and 3%, respectively. Additionally, Python emerges as the dominant programming language across the reviewed benchmarks. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges of current research and proposes future directions, aiming to narrow the gap between the theoretical capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents and their application in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce the novel task of Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D Scenes. Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding, this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled Vision Transformers (ViTs) to learn robust representations from large-scale natural image datasets, enhancing their generalization across domains. In retinal imaging, foundation models pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models, which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining, which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex tasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their uncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are strictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two phases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test time, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments, significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming (LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring significantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our approach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in unconstrained settings. Elastic Reasoning offers a principled and practical solution to the pressing challenge of controllable reasoning at scale.

Abstract: Accurate building segmentation from high-resolution RGB imagery remains challenging due to spectral similarity with non-building features, shadows, and irregular building geometries. In this study, we present a comprehensive deep learning framework for multiscale building segmentation using RGB aerial and satellite imagery with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.4m to 2.7m. We curate a diverse, multi-sensor dataset and introduce feature-augmented inputs by deriving secondary representations including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Visible Difference Vegetation Index (VDVI), Morphological Building Index (MBI), and Sobel edge filters from RGB channels. These features guide a Res-U-Net architecture in learning complex spatial patterns more effectively. We also propose training policies incorporating layer freezing, cyclical learning rates, and SuperConvergence to reduce training time and resource usage. Evaluated on a held-out WorldView-3 image, our model achieves an overall accuracy of 96.5%, an F1-score of 0.86, and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, outperforming existing RGB-based benchmarks. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining multi-resolution imagery, feature augmentation, and optimized training strategies for robust building segmentation in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Grain growth simulation is crucial for predicting metallic material microstructure evolution during annealing and resulting final mechanical properties, but traditional partial differential equation-based methods are computationally expensive, creating bottlenecks in materials design and manufacturing. In this work, we introduce a machine learning framework that combines a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory networks with an Autoencoder to efficiently predict grain growth evolution. Our approach captures both spatial and temporal aspects of grain evolution while encoding high-dimensional grain structure data into a compact latent space for pattern learning, enhanced by a novel composite loss function combining Mean Squared Error, Structural Similarity Index Measurement, and Boundary Preservation to maintain structural integrity of grain boundary topology of the prediction. Results demonstrated that our machine learning approach accelerates grain growth prediction by up to \SI{89}{\times} faster, reducing computation time from \SI{10}{\minute} to approximately \SI{10}{\second} while maintaining high-fidelity predictions. The best model (S-30-30) achieving a structural similarity score of \SI{86.71}{\percent} and mean grain size error of just \SI{0.07}{\percent}. All models accurately captured grain boundary topology, morphology, and size distributions. This approach enables rapid microstructural prediction for applications where conventional simulations are prohibitively time-consuming, potentially accelerating innovation in materials science and manufacturing.

Abstract: We present a method to reconstruct dynamic scenes from monocular continuous-wave time-of-flight (C-ToF) cameras using raw sensor samples that achieves similar or better accuracy than neural volumetric approaches and is 100x faster. Quickly achieving high-fidelity dynamic 3D reconstruction from a single viewpoint is a significant challenge in computer vision. In C-ToF radiance field reconstruction, the property of interest-depth-is not directly measured, causing an additional challenge. This problem has a large and underappreciated impact upon the optimization when using a fast primitive-based scene representation like 3D Gaussian splatting, which is commonly used with multi-view data to produce satisfactory results and is brittle in its optimization otherwise. We incorporate two heuristics into the optimization to improve the accuracy of scene geometry represented by Gaussians. Experimental results show that our approach produces accurate reconstructions under constrained C-ToF sensing conditions, including for fast motions like swinging baseball bats. https://visual.cs.brown.edu/gftorf

Abstract: Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips, provide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios. However, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has become a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a promising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data distributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples. Nevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional artificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this gap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time adaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution shifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which dynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired normalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in improving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for online test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of future neuromorphic chips. The demo code is available at github.com/NneurotransmitterR/TM-OTTA-SNN.

Abstract: Oblique decision trees have attracted attention due to their potential for improved classification performance over traditional axis-aligned decision trees. However, methods that rely on exhaustive search to find oblique splits face computational challenges. As a result, they have not been widely explored. We introduce a novel algorithm, Classification and Regression Tree - Exhaustive Linear Combinations (CART-ELC), for inducing oblique decision trees that performs an exhaustive search on a restricted set of hyperplanes. We then investigate the algorithm's computational complexity and its predictive capabilities. Our results demonstrate that CART-ELC consistently achieves competitive performance on small datasets, often yielding statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy relative to existing decision tree induction algorithms, while frequently producing shallower, simpler, and thus more interpretable trees.

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities of large language models are primarily studied for English, even when pretrained models are multilingual. In this work, we investigate to what extent English reasoning finetuning with long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) can generalize across languages. First, we find that scaling up inference compute for English-centric reasoning language models (RLMs) improves multilingual mathematical reasoning across many languages including low-resource languages, to an extent where they outperform models twice their size. Second, we reveal that while English-centric RLM's CoTs are naturally predominantly English, they consistently follow a quote-and-think pattern to reason about quoted non-English inputs. Third, we discover an effective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we observe that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource languages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in particular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English. Overall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the limitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time scaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason in high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning in low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) offers a potential boon for AI safety as it allows monitoring a model's CoT to try to understand its intentions and reasoning processes. However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected behaviors.

Abstract: Pioneering token-based works such as Chameleon and Emu3 have established a foundation for multimodal unification but face challenges of high training computational overhead and limited comprehension performance due to a lack of high-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in both comprehension and generation tasks. The code and models are available at https://github.com/TencentARC/TokLIP.

<title>TransProQA: an LLM-based literary Translation evaluation metric with Professional Question Answering</title>

Abstract: The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary domains. However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce TransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering (QA) framework designed specifically for literary translation evaluation. TransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, TransProQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. Notably, TransProQA approaches human-level evaluation performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations.

Abstract: Direct alignment methods are increasingly used for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, these methods suffer from the issues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the noisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and dispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and provide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the flexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance of LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple base and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations of existing direct alignment methods. A highlight of our work is that we evidence the importance of designing specialized methods for preference pairs with distinct likelihood margin, which complements the recent findings in \citet{Razin-2025-Unintentional}.

Specifically, StreamBridge incorporates (1) a memory buffer combined with a round-decayed compression strategy, supporting long-context multi-turn interactions, and (2) a decoupled, lightweight activation model that can be effortlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs, enabling continuous proactive responses. To further support StreamBridge, we construct Stream-IT, a large-scale dataset tailored for streaming video understanding, featuring interleaved video-text sequences and diverse instruction formats. Extensive experiments show that StreamBridge significantly improves the streaming understanding capabilities of offline Video-LLMs across various tasks, outperforming even proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Simultaneously, it achieves competitive or superior performance on standard video understanding benchmarks.

Abstract: We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our experiments.

Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) aims at identifying equivalent entity pairs across different knowledge graphs (KGs) that refer to the same real-world identity. To circumvent the shortage of seed alignments provided for training, recent EA models utilize pseudo-labeling strategies to iteratively add unaligned entity pairs predicted with high confidence to the seed alignments for model training. However, the adverse impact of confirmation bias during pseudo-labeling has been largely overlooked, thus hindering entity alignment performance. To systematically combat confirmation bias for pseudo-labeling-based entity alignment, we propose a Unified Pseudo-Labeling framework for Entity Alignment (UPL-EA) that explicitly eliminates pseudo-labeling errors to boost the accuracy of entity alignment. UPL-EA consists of two complementary components: (1) Optimal Transport (OT)-based pseudo-labeling uses discrete OT modeling as an effective means to determine entity correspondences and reduce erroneous matches across two KGs. An effective criterion is derived to infer pseudo-labeled alignments that satisfy one-to-one correspondences; (2) Parallel pseudo-label ensembling refines pseudo-labeled alignments by combining predictions over multiple models independently trained in parallel. The ensembled pseudo-labeled alignments are thereafter used to augment seed alignments to reinforce subsequent model training for alignment inference. The effectiveness of UPL-EA in eliminating pseudo-labeling errors is both theoretically supported and experimentally validated. Our extensive results and in-depth analyses demonstrate the superiority of UPL-EA over 15 competitive baselines and its utility as a general pseudo-labeling framework for entity alignment.

Abstract: Although AI has become increasingly smart, its wisdom has not kept pace. In this article, we examine what is known about human wisdom and sketch a vision of its AI counterpart. We analyze human wisdom as a set of strategies for solving intractable problems-those outside the scope of analytic techniques-including both object-level strategies like heuristics [for managing problems] and metacognitive strategies like intellectual humility, perspective-taking, or context-adaptability [for managing object-level strategies]. We argue that AI systems particularly struggle with metacognition; improved metacognition would lead to AI more robust to novel environments, explainable to users, cooperative with others, and safer in risking fewer misaligned goals with human users. We discuss how wise AI might be benchmarked, trained, and implemented.

Abstract: Solving complex planning problems requires Large Language Models (LLMs) to explicitly model the state transition to avoid rule violations, comply with constraints, and ensure optimality-a task hindered by the inherent ambiguity of natural language. To overcome such ambiguity, Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is leveraged as a planning abstraction that enables precise and formal state descriptions. With PDDL, we can generate a symbolic world model where classic searching algorithms, such as A*, can be seamlessly applied to find optimal plans. However, directly generating PDDL domains with current LLMs remains an open challenge due to the lack of PDDL training data. To address this challenge, we propose to scale up the test-time computation of LLMs to enhance their PDDL reasoning capabilities, thereby enabling the generation of high-quality PDDL domains. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, which first employs a Best-of-N sampling approach to improve the quality of the initial solution and then refines the solution in a fine-grained manner with verbalized machine learning. Our method outperforms o1-mini by a considerable margin in the generation of PDDL domains, achieving over 50\% success rate on two tasks (i.e., generating PDDL domains from natural language description or PDDL problems). This is done without requiring additional training. By taking advantage of PDDL as state abstraction, our method is able to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on almost all competition-level planning tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a simple, effective, and cost-efficient strategy to improve LLM performance by scaling test-time compute. Our strategy builds upon the repeated-sampling-then-voting framework, with a novel twist: incorporating multiple models, even weaker ones, to leverage their complementary strengths that potentially arise from diverse training data and paradigms. By using consistency as a signal, our strategy dynamically switches between models. Theoretical analysis highlights the efficiency and performance advantages of our strategy. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our strategy not only outperforms self-consistency and state-of-the-art multi-agent debate approaches, but also significantly reduces inference costs. Additionally, ModelSwitch requires only a few comparable LLMs to achieve optimal performance and can be extended with verification methods, demonstrating the potential of leveraging multiple LLMs in the generation-verification paradigm.

Abstract: Embodied agents exhibit immense potential across a multitude of domains, making the assurance of their behavioral safety a fundamental prerequisite for their widespread deployment. However, existing research predominantly concentrates on the security of general large language models, lacking specialized methodologies for establishing safety benchmarks and input moderation tailored to embodied agents. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel input moderation framework, meticulously designed to safeguard embodied agents. This framework encompasses the entire pipeline, including taxonomy definition, dataset curation, moderator architecture, model training, and rigorous evaluation. Notably, we introduce EAsafetyBench, a meticulously crafted safety benchmark engineered to facilitate both the training and stringent assessment of moderators specifically designed for embodied agents. Furthermore, we propose Pinpoint, an innovative prompt-decoupled input moderation scheme that harnesses a masked attention mechanism to effectively isolate and mitigate the influence of functional prompts on moderation tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse benchmark datasets and models validate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that our methodologies achieve an impressive average detection accuracy of 94.58%, surpassing the performance of existing state-of-the-art techniques, alongside an exceptional moderation processing time of merely 0.002 seconds per instance.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in social deduction games (SDGs) like Werewolf, where strategic reasoning and social deception are essential. However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.

Abstract: Probabilistic relational models such as parametric factor graphs enable efficient (lifted) inference by exploiting the indistinguishability of objects. In lifted inference, a representative of indistinguishable objects is used for computations. To obtain a relational (i.e., lifted) representation, the Advanced Colour Passing (ACP) algorithm is the state of the art. The ACP algorithm, however, requires underlying distributions, encoded as potential-based factorisations, to exactly match to identify and exploit indistinguishabilities. Hence, ACP is unsuitable for practical applications where potentials learned from data inevitably deviate even if associated objects are indistinguishable. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the $\varepsilon$-Advanced Colour Passing ($\varepsilon$-ACP) algorithm, which allows for a deviation of potentials depending on a hyperparameter $\varepsilon$. $\varepsilon$-ACP efficiently uncovers and exploits indistinguishabilities that are not exact. We prove that the approximation error induced by $\varepsilon$-ACP is strictly bounded and our experiments show that the approximation error is close to zero in practice.

Abstract: Data association is a crucial component for any multiple object tracking (MOT) method that follows the tracking-by-detection paradigm. To generate complete trajectories such methods employ a data association process to establish assignments between detections and existing targets during each timestep. Recent data association approaches try to solve either a multi-dimensional linear assignment task or a network flow minimization problem or tackle it via multiple hypotheses tracking. However, during inference an optimization step that computes optimal assignments is required for every sequence frame inducing additional complexity to any given solution. To this end, in the context of this work we introduce Transformer-based Assignment Decision Network (TADN) that tackles data association without the need of any explicit optimization during inference. In particular, TADN can directly infer assignment pairs between detections and active targets in a single forward pass of the network. We have integrated TADN in a rather simple MOT framework, designed a novel training strategy for efficient end-to-end training and demonstrated the high potential of our approach for online visual tracking-by-detection MOT on several popular benchmarks, i.e. MOT17, MOT20 and UA-DETRAC. Our proposed approach demonstrates strong performance in most evaluation metrics despite its simple nature as a tracker lacking significant auxiliary components such as occlusion handling or re-identification. The implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/psaltaath/tadn-mot.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced medical imaging analysis (MIA), achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks. However, its success largely depends on large-scale, high-quality labeled datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain due to the need for expert annotation. To mitigate this limitation, label-efficient deep learning methods have emerged to improve model performance under limited supervision by leveraging labeled, unlabeled, and weakly labeled data. In this survey, we systematically review over 350 peer-reviewed studies and present a comprehensive taxonomy of label-efficient learning methods in MIA. These methods are categorized into four labeling paradigms: no label, insufficient label, inexact label, and label refinement. For each category, we analyze representative techniques across imaging modalities and clinical applications, highlighting shared methodological principles and task-specific adaptations. We also examine the growing role of health foundation models (HFMs) in enabling label-efficient learning through large-scale pre-training and transfer learning, enhancing the use of limited annotations in downstream tasks. Finally, we identify current challenges and future directions to facilitate the translation of label-efficient learning from research promise to everyday clinical care.

Abstract: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Nevertheless, early diagnosis of cancer is a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to medical resources and trained radiologists is limited. The objective of this study is to propose an automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for the early detection and classification of lung nodules, specifically for low-resource settings. The proposed framework consists of three stages: lung segmentation using a modified 3D U-Net named 3D Res-U-Net, nodule detection using YOLO-v5, and classification with a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We evaluated the proposed framework on a publicly available dataset, LUNA16. The proposed framework's performance was measured using the respective domain's evaluation matrices. The proposed framework achieved a 98.82% lung segmentation dice score while detecting the lung nodule with 0.76 mAP@50 from the segmented lung, at a low false-positive rate. The performance of both networks of the proposed framework was compared with other studies and found to outperform them regarding segmentation and detection accuracy. Additionally, our proposed Vision transformer network obtained an accuracy of 93.57%, which is 1.21% higher than the state-of-the-art networks. Our proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can effectively segment lungs, and detect and classify lung nodules, specifically in low-resource settings with limited access to radiologists. The proposed framework outperforms existing studies regarding all the respective evaluation metrics. The proposed framework can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening in low-resource settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks have revolutionized machine learning in recent years, but a complete theoretical framework for their learning process is still lacking. Substantial advances were achieved for wide networks, within two disparate theoretical frameworks: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which assumes linearized gradient descent dynamics, and the Bayesian Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). We unify these two theories using gradient descent learning with an additional noise in an ensemble of wide deep networks. We construct an analytical theory for the network input-output function and introduce a new time-dependent Neural Dynamical Kernel (NDK) from which both NTK and NNGP kernels are derived. We identify two learning phases: a gradient-driven learning phase, dominated by loss minimization, in which the time scale is governed by the initialization variance. It is followed by a slow diffusive learning stage, where the parameters sample the solution space, with a time constant decided by the noise and the Bayesian prior variance. The two variance parameters strongly affect the performance in the two regimes, especially in sigmoidal neurons. In contrast to the exponential convergence of the mean predictor in the initial phase, the convergence to the equilibrium is more complex and may behave nonmonotonically. By characterizing the diffusive phase, our work sheds light on representational drift in the brain, explaining how neural activity changes continuously without degrading performance, either by ongoing gradient signals that synchronize the drifts of different synapses or by architectural biases that generate task-relevant information that is robust against the drift process. This work closes the gap between the NTK and NNGP theories, providing a comprehensive framework for the learning process of deep wide neural networks and for analyzing dynamics in biological circuits.

<title>The Inadequacy of Similarity-based Privacy Metrics: Privacy Attacks against "Truly Anonymous" Synthetic Datasets</title>

Abstract: Generative models producing synthetic data are meant to provide a privacy-friendly approach to releasing data. However, their privacy guarantees are only considered robust when models satisfy Differential Privacy (DP). Alas, this is not a ubiquitous standard, as many leading companies (and, in fact, research papers) use ad-hoc privacy metrics based on testing the statistical similarity between synthetic and real data.
  In this paper, we examine the privacy metrics used in real-world synthetic data deployments and demonstrate their unreliability in several ways. First, we provide counter-examples where severe privacy violations occur even if the privacy tests pass and instantiate accurate membership and attribute inference attacks with minimal cost. We then introduce ReconSyn, a reconstruction attack that generates multiple synthetic datasets that are considered private by the metrics but actually leak information unique to individual records. We show that ReconSyn recovers 78-100% of the outliers in the train data with only black-box access to a single fitted generative model and the privacy metrics. In the process, we show that applying DP only to the model does not mitigate this attack, as using privacy metrics breaks the end-to-end DP pipeline.

Abstract: Conventional deep learning (DL) model compression and scaling methods focus on altering the model's components, impacting the results across all samples uniformly. However, since samples vary in difficulty, a dynamic model that adapts computation based on sample complexity offers a novel perspective for compression and scaling. Despite this potential, existing dynamic models are typically monolithic and model-specific, limiting their generalizability as broad compression and scaling methods. Additionally, most deployed DL systems are fixed, unable to adjust their scale once deployed and, therefore, cannot adapt to the varying real-time demands. This paper introduces DyCE, a dynamically configurable system that can adjust the performance-complexity trade-off of a DL model at runtime without requiring re-initialization or redeployment on inference hardware. DyCE achieves this by adding small exit networks to intermediate layers of the original model, allowing computation to terminate early if acceptable results are obtained. DyCE also decouples the design of an efficient dynamic model, facilitating easy adaptation to new base models and potential general use in compression and scaling. We also propose methods for generating optimized configurations and determining the types and positions of exit networks to achieve desired performance and complexity trade-offs. By enabling simple configuration switching, DyCE provides fine-grained performance tuning in real-time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DyCE through image classification tasks using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). DyCE significantly reduces computational complexity by 23.5% for ResNet152 and 25.9% for ConvNextv2-tiny on ImageNet, with accuracy reductions of less than 0.5%.

Abstract: The Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT), a notable segment within the IoT domain, involves the integration of IoT technology into consumer electronics and devices, such as smart homes and smart wearables. Compared to traditional IoT fields, CIoT differs notably in target users, product types, and design approaches. While offering convenience to users, it also raises new security and privacy concerns. Network traffic analysis, a widely used technique in the security community, has been extensively applied to investigate these concerns about CIoT. Compared to traditional network traffic analysis in fields like mobile apps and websites, CIoT introduces unique characteristics that pose new challenges and research opportunities. Researchers have made significant contributions in this area. To aid researchers in understanding the application of traffic analysis tools for assessing CIoT security and privacy risks, this survey reviews 310 publications on traffic analysis within the CIoT security and privacy domain from January 2018 to June 2024, focusing on three research questions. Our work: 1) outlines the CIoT traffic analysis process and highlights its differences from general network traffic analysis. 2) summarizes and classifies existing research into four categories according to its application objectives: device fingerprinting, user activity inference, malicious traffic detection, and measurement. 3) explores emerging challenges and potential future research directions based on each step of the CIoT traffic analysis process. This will provide new insights to the community and guide the industry towards safer product designs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in event argument extraction (EAE) involve incorporating useful auxiliary information into models during training and inference, such as retrieved instances and event templates. These methods face two challenges: (1) the retrieval results may be irrelevant and (2) templates are developed independently for each event without considering their possible relationship. In this work, we propose DEGAP to address these challenges through a simple yet effective components: dual prefixes, i.e. learnable prompt vectors, where the instance-oriented prefix and template-oriented prefix are trained to learn information from different event instances and templates. Additionally, we propose an event-guided adaptive gating mechanism, which can adaptively leverage possible connections between different events and thus capture relevant information from the prefix. Finally, these event-guided prefixes provide relevant information as cues to EAE model without retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four datasets (ACE05, RAMS, WIKIEVENTS, and MLEE). Further analysis shows the impact of different components.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is rapidly encroaching on the field of service regulation. However, existing AI-based regulation techniques are often tailored to specific application domains and thus are difficult to generalize in an automated manner. This paper presents Horae, a unified specification language for modeling (multimodal) regulation rules across a diverse set of domains. We showcase how Horae facilitates an intelligent service regulation pipeline by further exploiting a fine-tuned large language model named RuleGPT that automates the Horae modeling process, thereby yielding an end-to-end framework for fully automated intelligent service regulation. The feasibility and effectiveness of our framework are demonstrated over a benchmark of various real-world regulation domains. In particular, we show that our open-sourced, fine-tuned RuleGPT with 7B parameters suffices to outperform GPT-3.5 and perform on par with GPT-4o.

Abstract: Differential testing offers a promising strategy to alleviate the test oracle problem by comparing the test results between alternative implementations. However, existing differential testing techniques for deep learning (DL) libraries are limited by the key challenges of finding alternative implementations (called counterparts) for a given API and subsequently generating diverse test inputs. To address the two challenges, this paper introduces DLLens, an LLM-enhanced differential testing technique for DL libraries. To address the first challenge, DLLens incorporates an LLM-based counterpart synthesis workflow, with the insight that the counterpart of a given DL library API's computation could be successfully synthesized through certain composition and adaptation of the APIs from another DL library. To address the second challenge, DLLens incorporates a static analysis technique that extracts the path constraints from the implementations of a given API and its counterpart to guide diverse test input generation. The extraction is facilitated by LLM's knowledge of the concerned DL library and its upstream libraries.
  We evaluate DLLens on two popular DL libraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our evaluation shows that DLLens synthesizes counterparts for 1.84 times as many APIs as those found by state-of-the-art techniques on these libraries. Moreover, under the same time budget, DLLens covers 7.23% more branches and detects 1.88 times as many bugs as state-of-the-art techniques on 200 randomly sampled APIs. DLLens has successfully detected 71 bugs in recent TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries. Among them, 59 are confirmed by developers, including 46 confirmed as previously unknown bugs, and 10 of these previously unknown bugs have been fixed in the latest version of TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Abstract: Memorization in language models is typically treated as a homogenous phenomenon, neglecting the specifics of the memorized data. We instead model memorization as the effect of a set of complex factors that describe each sample and relate it to the model and corpus. To build intuition around these factors, we break memorization down into a taxonomy: recitation of highly duplicated sequences, reconstruction of inherently predictable sequences, and recollection of sequences that are neither. We demonstrate the usefulness of our taxonomy by using it to construct a predictive model for memorization. By analyzing dependencies and inspecting the weights of the predictive model, we find that different factors influence the likelihood of memorization differently depending on the taxonomic category.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, the integration of flow-level and packet-level information for real-time intrusion detection remains a largely untapped area of research. This paper introduces "XG-NID," a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to fuse flow-level and packet-level data within a heterogeneous graph structure, offering a comprehensive analysis of network traffic. Leveraging a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) with graph-level classification, XG-NID uniquely enables real-time inference while effectively capturing the intricate relationships between flow and packet payload data. Unlike traditional GNN-based methodologies that predominantly analyze historical data, XG-NID is designed to accommodate the heterogeneous nature of network traffic, providing a robust and real-time defense mechanism. Our framework extends beyond mere classification; it integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate detailed, human-readable explanations and suggest potential remedial actions, ensuring that the insights produced are both actionable and comprehensible. Additionally, we introduce a new set of flow features based on temporal information, further enhancing the contextual and explainable inferences provided by our model. To facilitate practical application and accessibility, we developed "GNN4ID," an open-source tool that enables the extraction and transformation of raw network traffic into the proposed heterogeneous graph structure, seamlessly integrating flow and packet-level data. Our comprehensive quantitative comparative analysis demonstrates that XG-NID achieves an F1 score of 97\% in multi-class classification, outperforming existing baseline and state-of-the-art methods. This sets a new standard in Network Intrusion Detection Systems by combining innovative data fusion with enhanced interpretability and real-time capabilities.

Abstract: Complex 3D scene understanding has gained increasing attention, with scene encoding strategies playing a crucial role in this success. However, the optimal scene encoding strategies for various scenarios remain unclear, particularly compared to their image-based counterparts. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive study that probes various visual encoding models for 3D scene understanding, identifying the strengths and limitations of each model across different scenarios. Our evaluation spans seven vision foundation encoders, including image-based, video-based, and 3D foundation models. We evaluate these models in four tasks: Vision-Language Scene Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Segmentation, and Registration, each focusing on different aspects of scene understanding. Our evaluations yield key findings: DINOv2 demonstrates superior performance, video models excel in object-level tasks, diffusion models benefit geometric tasks, and language-pretrained models show unexpected limitations in language-related tasks. These insights challenge some conventional understandings, provide novel perspectives on leveraging visual foundation models, and highlight the need for more flexible encoder selection in future vision-language and scene-understanding tasks.

Abstract: The influence of textures on machine learning models has been an ongoing investigation, specifically in texture bias/learning, interpretability, and robustness. However, due to the lack of large and diverse texture data available, the findings in these works have been limited, as more comprehensive evaluations have not been feasible. Image generative models are able to provide data creation at scale, but utilizing these models for texture synthesis has been unexplored and poses additional challenges both in creating accurate texture images and validating those images. In this work, we introduce an extensible methodology and corresponding new dataset for generating high-quality, diverse texture images capable of supporting a broad set of texture-based tasks. Our pipeline consists of: (1) developing prompts from a range of descriptors to serve as input to text-to-image models, (2) adopting and adapting Stable Diffusion pipelines to generate and filter the corresponding images, and (3) further filtering down to the highest quality images. Through this, we create the Prompted Textures Dataset (PTD), a dataset of 362,880 texture images that span 56 textures. During the process of generating images, we find that NSFW safety filters in image generation pipelines are highly sensitive to texture (and flag up to 60\% of our texture images), uncovering a potential bias in these models and presenting unique challenges when working with texture data. Through both standard metrics and a human evaluation, we find that our dataset is high quality and diverse. Our dataset is available for download at https://zenodo.org/records/15359142.

<title>Exploring the Trade-Offs: Quantization Methods, Task Difficulty, and Model Size in Large Language Models From Edge to Giant</title>

Abstract: Quantization has gained attention as a promising solution for the cost-effective deployment of large and small language models. However, most prior work has been limited to perplexity or basic knowledge tasks and lacks a comprehensive evaluation of recent models like Llama-3.3. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of instruction-tuned models spanning 1B to 405B parameters, applying four quantization methods across 13 datasets. Our findings reveal that (1) quantized models generally surpass smaller FP16 baselines, yet they often struggle with instruction-following and hallucination detection; (2) FP8 consistently emerges as the most robust option across tasks, and AWQ tends to outperform GPTQ in weight-only quantization; (3) smaller models can suffer severe accuracy drops at 4-bit quantization, while 70B-scale models maintain stable performance; (4) notably, \textit{hard} tasks do not always experience the largest accuracy losses, indicating that quantization magnifies a model's inherent weaknesses rather than simply correlating with task difficulty; and (5) an LLM-based judge (MT-Bench) highlights significant performance declines in coding and STEM tasks, though reasoning may sometimes improve.

Abstract: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are frequently performed in clinical settings. Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.

<title>To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic reasoning</title>

arXiv:2409.12183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications.

<title>Learning to Compare Hardware Designs for High-Level Synthesis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2409.13138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) is an automated design process that transforms high-level code into hardware designs, enabling the rapid development of hardware accelerators. HLS relies on pragmas, which are directives inserted into the source code to guide the synthesis process, and pragmas have various settings and values that significantly impact the resulting hardware design. State-of-the-art ML-based HLS methods, such as HARP, first train a deep learning model, typically based on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to graph-based representations of the source code and pragmas. They then perform design space exploration (DSE) to explore the pragma design space, rank candidate designs using the model, and return the top designs. However, traditional DSE methods face challenges due to the highly nonlinear relationship between pragma settings and performance metrics, along with complex interactions between pragmas that affect performance in non-obvious ways.
  To address these challenges, we propose compareXplore, a novel approach that learns to compare hardware designs for effective HLS optimization. CompareXplore introduces a hybrid loss function that combines pairwise preference learning with pointwise performance prediction, enabling the model to capture both relative preferences and absolute performance. Moreover, we introduce a novel node difference attention module that focuses on the most informative differences between designs, enabling the model to identify critical pragmas impacting performance. CompareXplore adopts a two-stage DSE, where a pointwise prediction model is used for the initial design pruning, followed by a pairwise comparison stage for precise performance verification. In extensive experiments, compareXplore achieves significant improvements in ranking metrics and generates high-quality HLS results for the selected designs, outperforming the existing SOTA method.

<title>CATCH: Channel-Aware multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection via Frequency Patching</title>

Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is challenging as heterogeneous subsequence anomalies may occur. Reconstruction-based methods, which focus on learning normal patterns in the frequency domain to detect diverse abnormal subsequences, achieve promising results, while still falling short on capturing fine-grained frequency characteristics and channel correlations. To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets demonstrate that CATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance. We make our code and datasets available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/CATCH.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with culture-specific knowledge, particularly in languages other than English and in underrepresented cultural contexts. To evaluate their understanding of such knowledge, we introduce WorldCuisines, a massive-scale benchmark for multilingual and multicultural, visually grounded language understanding. This benchmark includes a visual question answering (VQA) dataset with text-image pairs across 30 languages and dialects, spanning 9 language families and featuring over 1 million data points, making it the largest multicultural VQA benchmark to date. It includes tasks for identifying dish names and their origins. We provide evaluation datasets in two sizes (12k and 60k instances) alongside a training dataset (1 million instances). Our findings show that while VLMs perform better with correct location context, they struggle with adversarial contexts and predicting specific regional cuisines and languages. To support future research, we release a knowledge base with annotated food entries and images along with the VQA data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by advancing natural language understanding and generation, enabling applications across fields beyond healthcare, software engineering, and conversational systems. Despite these advancements in the past few years, LLMs have shown considerable vulnerabilities, particularly to prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks. This review analyzes the state of research on these vulnerabilities and presents available defense strategies. We roughly categorize attack approaches into prompt-based, model-based, multimodal, and multilingual, covering techniques such as adversarial prompting, backdoor injections, and cross-modality exploits. We also review various defense mechanisms, including prompt filtering, transformation, alignment techniques, multi-agent defenses, and self-regulation, evaluating their strengths and shortcomings. We also discuss key metrics and benchmarks used to assess LLM safety and robustness, noting challenges like the quantification of attack success in interactive contexts and biases in existing datasets. Identifying current research gaps, we suggest future directions for resilient alignment strategies, advanced defenses against evolving attacks, automation of jailbreak detection, and consideration of ethical and societal impacts. This review emphasizes the need for continued research and cooperation within the AI community to enhance LLM security and ensure their safe deployment.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation methods often neglect the quality of content retrieved from external knowledge bases, resulting in irrelevant information or potential misinformation that negatively affects the generation results of large language models. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model with adaptive filtering for retrieval-augmented generation (E2E-AFG), which integrates answer existence judgment and text generation into a single end-to-end framework. This enables the model to focus more effectively on relevant content while reducing the influence of irrelevant information and generating accurate answers. We evaluate E2E-AFG on six representative knowledge-intensive language datasets, and the results show that it consistently outperforms baseline models across all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more prevalent, concerns about their safety, ethics, and potential biases have risen. Systematically evaluating LLMs' risk decision-making tendencies and attitudes, particularly in the ethical domain, has become crucial. This study innovatively applies the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) scale from cognitive science to LLMs and proposes a novel Ethical Decision-Making Risk Attitude Scale (EDRAS) to assess LLMs' ethical risk attitudes in depth. We further propose a novel approach integrating risk scales and role-playing to quantitatively evaluate systematic biases in LLMs. Through systematic evaluation and analysis of multiple mainstream LLMs, we assessed the "risk personalities" of LLMs across multiple domains, with a particular focus on the ethical domain, and revealed and quantified LLMs' systematic biases towards different groups. This research helps understand LLMs' risk decision-making and ensure their safe and reliable application. Our approach provides a tool for identifying and mitigating biases, contributing to fairer and more trustworthy AI systems. The code and data are available.

Abstract: Indoor pathloss prediction is a fundamental task in wireless network planning, yet it remains challenging due to environmental complexity and data scarcity. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based approach utilizing a vision transformer (ViT) architecture with DINO-v2 pretrained weights to model indoor radio propagation. Our method processes a floor map with additional features of the walls to generate indoor pathloss maps. We systematically evaluate the effects of architectural choices, data augmentation strategies, and feature engineering techniques. Our findings indicate that extensive augmentation significantly improves generalization, while feature engineering is crucial in low-data regimes. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the robustness of our model across different generalization scenarios.

Abstract: Ensuring cultural values alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, as these models often embed Western-centric biases from their training data, leading to misrepresentations and fairness concerns in cross-cultural applications. Existing approaches such as role assignment and few-shot learning struggle to address these limitations effectively due to their reliance on pre-trained knowledge, limited scalability, and inability to capture nuanced cultural values. To address these issues, we propose ValuesRAG, a novel and effective framework that applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate cultural and demographic knowledge dynamically during text generation. Leveraging the World Values Survey (WVS) dataset, ValuesRAG first generates summaries of values for each individual. We subsequently curate several representative regional datasets to serve as test datasets and retrieve relevant summaries of values based on demographic features, followed by a reranking step to select the top-k relevant summaries. We evaluate ValuesRAG using 6 diverse regional datasets and show that it consistently outperforms baselines: including zero-shot, role-assignment, few-shot, and hybrid methods, both in main experiments and ablation settings. Notably, ValuesRAG achieves the best overall performance over prior methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in fostering culturally aligned and inclusive AI systems. Our findings underscore the potential of dynamic retrieval-based methods to bridge the gap between global LLM capabilities and localized cultural values.

Abstract: Clustering is often a challenging problem because of the inherent ambiguity in what the "correct" clustering should be. Even when the number of clusters $K$ is known, this ambiguity often still exists, particularly when there is variation in density among different clusters, and clusters have multiple relatively separated regions of high density. In this paper we propose an information-theoretic characterization of when a $K$-clustering is ambiguous, and design an algorithm that recovers the clustering whenever it is unambiguous. This characterization formalizes the situation when two high density regions within a cluster are separable enough that they look more like two distinct clusters than two truly distinct clusters in the $K$-clustering. The algorithm first identifies $K$ partial clusters (or "seeds") using a density-based approach, and then adds unclustered points to the initial $K$ partial clusters in a greedy manner to form a complete clustering. We implement and test a version of the algorithm that is modified to effectively handle overlapping clusters, and observe that it requires little parameter selection and displays improved performance on many datasets compared to widely used algorithms for non-convex cluster recovery.

Abstract: Communication between multiple language model (LM) agents has been shown to scale up the reasoning ability of LMs. While natural language has been the dominant medium for inter-LM communication, it is not obvious this should be the standard: not only does natural language communication incur high inference costs that scale quickly with the number of both agents and messages, but also the decoding process abstracts away too much rich information that could be otherwise accessed from the internal activations. In this work, we propose a simple technique whereby LMs communicate via activations; concretely, we pause an LM $\textit{B}$'s computation at an intermediate layer, combine its current activation with another LM $\textit{A}$'s intermediate activation via some function $\textit{f}$, then pass $\textit{f}$'s output into the next layer of $\textit{B}$ and continue the forward pass till decoding is complete. This approach scales up LMs on new tasks with zero additional parameters and data, and saves a substantial amount of compute over natural language communication. We test our method with various functional forms $\textit{f}$ on two experimental setups--multi-player coordination games and reasoning benchmarks--and find that it achieves up to $27.0\%$ improvement over natural language communication across datasets with $<$$1/4$ the compute, illustrating the superiority and robustness of activations as an alternative "language" for communication between LMs.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Right to AI, which asserts that individuals and communities should meaningfully participate in the development and governance of the AI systems that shape their lives. Motivated by the increasing deployment of AI in critical domains and inspired by Henri Lefebvre's concept of the Right to the City, we reconceptualize AI as a societal infrastructure, rather than merely a product of expert design. In this paper, we critically evaluate how generative agents, large-scale data extraction, and diverse cultural values bring new complexities to AI oversight. The paper proposes that grassroots participatory methodologies can mitigate biased outcomes and enhance social responsiveness. It asserts that data is socially produced and should be managed and owned collectively. Drawing on Sherry Arnstein's Ladder of Citizen Participation and analyzing nine case studies, the paper develops a four-tier model for the Right to AI that situates the current paradigm and envisions an aspirational future. It proposes recommendations for inclusive data ownership, transparent design processes, and stakeholder-driven oversight. We also discuss market-led and state-centric alternatives and argue that participatory approaches offer a better balance between technical efficiency and democratic legitimacy.

Abstract: Agents trained via reinforcement learning (RL) often struggle to perform well on tasks that differ from those encountered during training. This limitation presents a challenge to the broader deployment of RL in diverse and dynamic task settings. In this work, we introduce memory augmentation, a memory-based RL approach to improve task generalization. Our approach leverages task-structured augmentations to simulate plausible out-of-distribution scenarios and incorporates memory mechanisms to enable context-aware policy adaptation. Trained on a predefined set of tasks, our policy demonstrates the ability to generalize to unseen tasks through memory augmentation without requiring additional interactions with the environment. Through extensive simulation experiments and real-world hardware evaluations on legged locomotion tasks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks while maintaining robust in-distribution performance and high sample efficiency.

Abstract: Texture synthesis is a fundamental task in computer vision, whose goal is to generate visually realistic and structurally coherent textures for a wide range of applications, from graphics to scientific simulations. While traditional methods like tiling and patch-based techniques often struggle with complex textures, recent advancements in deep learning have transformed this field. In this paper, we propose ViT-SGAN, a new hybrid model that fuses Vision Transformers (ViTs) with a Spatial Generative Adversarial Network (SGAN) to address the limitations of previous methods. By incorporating specialized texture descriptors such as mean-variance (mu, sigma) and textons into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, our model achieves superior texture synthesis. This approach enhances the model's capacity to capture complex spatial dependencies, leading to improved texture quality that is superior to state-of-the-art models, especially for regular and irregular textures. Comparison experiments with metrics such as FID, IS, SSIM, and LPIPS demonstrate the substantial improvement of ViT-SGAN, which underlines its efficiency in generating diverse realistic textures.

Abstract: The recent surge in advanced generative models, such as diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs), has led to an alarming rise in AI-generated images across various domains on the web. While such technologies offer benefits such as democratizing artistic creation, they also pose challenges in misinformation, digital forgery, and authenticity verification. Additionally, the uncredited use of AI-generated images in media and marketing has sparked significant backlash from online communities. In response to this, we introduce DejAIvu, a Chrome Web extension that combines real-time AI-generated image detection with saliency-based explainability while users browse the web. Using an ONNX-optimized deep learning model, DejAIvu automatically analyzes images on websites such as Google Images, identifies AI-generated content using model inference, and overlays a saliency heatmap to highlight AI-related artifacts. Our approach integrates efficient in-browser inference, gradient-based saliency analysis, and a seamless user experience, ensuring that AI detection is both transparent and interpretable. We also evaluate DejAIvu across multiple pretrained architectures and benchmark datasets, demonstrating high accuracy and low latency, making it a practical and deployable tool for enhancing AI image accountability. The code for this system can be found at https://github.com/Noodulz/dejAIvu.

Abstract: Recently, the DeepSeek series of models, leveraging their exceptional reasoning capabilities and open-source strategy, is reshaping the global AI landscape. Despite these advantages, they exhibit significant safety deficiencies. Research conducted by Robust Intelligence, a subsidiary of Cisco, in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania, revealed that DeepSeek-R1 has a 100\% attack success rate when processing harmful prompts. Additionally, multiple safety companies and research institutions have confirmed critical safety vulnerabilities in this model. As models demonstrating robust performance in Chinese and English, DeepSeek models require equally crucial safety assessments in both language contexts. However, current research has predominantly focused on safety evaluations in English environments, leaving a gap in comprehensive assessments of their safety performance in Chinese contexts. In response to this gap, this study introduces CHiSafetyBench, a Chinese-specific safety evaluation benchmark. This benchmark systematically evaluates the safety of DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 in Chinese contexts, revealing their performance across safety categories. The experimental results quantify the deficiencies of these two models in Chinese contexts, providing key insights for subsequent improvements. It should be noted that, despite our efforts to establish a comprehensive, objective, and authoritative evaluation benchmark, the selection of test samples, characteristics of data distribution, and the setting of evaluation criteria may inevitably introduce certain biases into the evaluation results. We will continuously optimize the evaluation benchmark and periodically update this report to provide more comprehensive and accurate assessment outcomes. Please refer to the latest version of the paper for the most recent evaluation results and conclusions.

<title>Correcting Noisy Multilabel Predictions: Modeling Label Noise through Latent Space Shifts</title>

Abstract: Noise in data appears to be inevitable in most real-world machine learning applications and would cause severe overfitting problems. Not only can data features contain noise, but labels are also prone to be noisy due to human input. In this paper, rather than noisy label learning in multiclass classifications, we instead focus on the less explored area of noisy label learning for multilabel classifications. Specifically, we investigate the post-correction of predictions generated from classifiers learned with noisy labels. The reasons are two-fold. Firstly, this approach can directly work with the trained models to save computational resources. Secondly, it could be applied on top of other noisy label correction techniques to achieve further improvements. To handle this problem, we appeal to deep generative approaches that are possible for uncertainty estimation. Our model posits that label noise arises from a stochastic shift in the latent variable, providing a more robust and beneficial means for noisy learning. We develop both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods for our model. The extensive empirical study presents solid evidence to that our approach is able to consistently improve the independent models and performs better than a number of existing methods across various noisy label settings. Moreover, a comprehensive empirical analysis of the proposed method is carried out to validate its robustness, including sensitivity analysis and an ablation study, among other elements.

<title>TLOB: A Novel Transformer Model with Dual Attention for Price Trend Prediction with Limit Order Book Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15757</link>

Abstract: Price Trend Prediction (PTP) based on Limit Order Book (LOB) data is a fundamental challenge in financial markets. Despite advances in deep learning, existing models fail to generalize across different market conditions and assets. Surprisingly, by adapting a simple MLP-based architecture to LOB, we show that we surpass SoTA performance; thus, challenging the necessity of complex architectures. Unlike past work that shows robustness issues, we propose TLOB, a transformer-based model that uses a dual attention mechanism to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in LOB data. This allows it to adaptively focus on the market microstructure, making it particularly effective for longer-horizon predictions and volatile market conditions. We also introduce a new labeling method that improves on previous ones, removing the horizon bias. We evaluate TLOB's effectiveness across four horizons, using the established FI-2010 benchmark, a NASDAQ and a Bitcoin dataset. TLOB outperforms SoTA methods in every dataset and horizon. Additionally, we empirically show how stock price predictability has declined over time, -6.68 in F1-score, highlighting the growing market efficiency. Predictability must be considered in relation to transaction costs, so we experimented with defining trends using an average spread, reflecting the primary transaction cost. The resulting performance deterioration underscores the complexity of translating trend classification into profitable trading strategies. We argue that our work provides new insights into the evolving landscape of stock price trend prediction and sets a strong foundation for future advancements in financial AI. We release the code at https://github.com/LeonardoBerti00/TLOB.

Abstract: Stellar flare events are critical observational samples for astronomical research; however, recorded flare events remain limited. Stellar flare forecasting can provide additional flare event samples to support research efforts. Despite this potential, no specialized models for stellar flare forecasting have been proposed to date. In this paper, we present extensive experimental evidence demonstrating that both stellar physical properties and historical flare records are valuable inputs for flare forecasting tasks. We then introduce FLARE (Forecasting Light-curve-based Astronomical Records via features Ensemble), the first-of-its-kind large model specifically designed for stellar flare forecasting. FLARE integrates stellar physical properties and historical flare records through a novel Soft Prompt Module and Residual Record Fusion Module. Our experiments on the publicly available Kepler light curve dataset demonstrate that FLARE achieves superior performance compared to other methods across all evaluation metrics. Finally, we validate the forecast capability of our model through a comprehensive case study.

<title>Faster, Cheaper, Better: Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization for LLM and RAG Systems</title>

Abstract: While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular technique for improving Large Language Model (LLM) systems, it introduces a large number of choices, parameters and hyperparameters that must be made or tuned. This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.

<title>LIVS: A Pluralistic Alignment Dataset for Inclusive Public Spaces</title>

Abstract: We introduce the Local Intersectional Visual Spaces (LIVS) dataset, a benchmark for multi-criteria alignment, developed through a two-year participatory process with 30 community organizations to support the pluralistic alignment of text-to-image (T2I) models in inclusive urban planning. The dataset encodes 37,710 pairwise comparisons across 13,462 images, structured along six criteria - Accessibility, Safety, Comfort, Invitingness, Inclusivity, and Diversity - derived from 634 community-defined concepts. Using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), we fine-tune Stable Diffusion XL to reflect multi-criteria spatial preferences and evaluate the LIVS dataset and the fine-tuned model through four case studies: (1) DPO increases alignment with annotated preferences, particularly when annotation volume is high; (2) preference patterns vary across participant identities, underscoring the need for intersectional data; (3) human-authored prompts generate more distinctive visual outputs than LLM-generated ones, influencing annotation decisiveness; and (4) intersectional groups assign systematically different ratings across criteria, revealing the limitations of single-objective alignment. While DPO improves alignment under specific conditions, the prevalence of neutral ratings indicates that community values are heterogeneous and often ambiguous. LIVS provides a benchmark for developing T2I models that incorporate local, stakeholder-driven preferences, offering a foundation for context-aware alignment in spatial design.

<title>Semantic Shift Estimation via Dual-Projection and Classifier Reconstruction for Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05423</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2503.05423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to sequentially learn from distinct categories without retaining exemplars but easily suffers from catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. While existing EFCIL methods leverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two critical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the embeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks, and the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with new data, thereby hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates semantic shift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable transformation with a row-space projection to capture both task-wise and category-wise shifts. Furthermore, to mitigate decision bias, DPCR employs ridge regression to reformulate classifier training as a reconstruction process. This reconstruction exploits previous information encoded in covariance and prototype of each class after calibration with estimated shift, thereby reducing decision bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, across various datasets, DPCR effectively balances old and new tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art EFCIL methods.

arXiv:2503.08292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to outpatient referral tasks across healthcare systems. However, there is a lack of standardized evaluation criteria to assess their effectiveness, particularly in dynamic, interactive scenarios. In this study, we systematically examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in managing tasks within Intelligent Outpatient Referral (IOR) systems and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed for such systems. This framework comprises two core tasks: static evaluation, which focuses on evaluating the ability of predefined outpatient referrals, and dynamic evaluation, which evaluates capabilities of refining outpatient referral recommendations through iterative dialogues. Our findings suggest that LLMs offer limited advantages over BERT-like models, but show promise in asking effective questions during interactive dialogues.

<title>Negotiative Alignment: Embracing Disagreement to Achieve Fairer Outcomes -- Insights from Urban Studies</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12613</link>

arXiv:2503.12613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cities are not monolithic; they are arenas of negotiation among groups that hold varying needs, values, and experiences. Conventional methods of urban assessment -- from standardized surveys to AI-driven evaluations -- frequently rely on a single consensus metric (e.g., an average measure of inclusivity or safety). Although such aggregations simplify design decisions, they risk obscuring the distinct perspectives of marginalized populations. In this paper, we present findings from a community-centered study in Montreal involving 35 residents with diverse demographic and social identities, particularly wheelchair users, seniors, and LGBTQIA2+ individuals. Using rating and ranking tasks on 20 urban sites, we observe that disagreements are systematic rather than random, reflecting structural inequalities, differing cultural values, and personal experiences of safety and accessibility.
  Based on these empirical insights, we propose negotiative alignment, an AI framework that treats disagreement as an essential input to be preserved, analyzed, and addressed. Negotiative alignment builds on pluralistic models by dynamically updating stakeholder preferences through multi-agent negotiation mechanisms, ensuring no single perspective is marginalized. We outline how this framework can be integrated into urban analytics -- and other decision-making contexts -- to retain minority viewpoints, adapt to changing stakeholder concerns, and enhance fairness and accountability. The study demonstrates that preserving and engaging with disagreement, rather than striving for an artificial consensus, can produce more equitable and responsive AI-driven outcomes in urban design.

<title>Integrating AI for Human-Centric Breast Cancer Diagnostics: A Multi-Scale and Multi-View Swin Transformer Framework</title>

Abstract: Despite advancements in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems, breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shown significant promise in development of advanced Deep Learning (DL) architectures for breast cancer diagnosis through mammography. In this context, the paper focuses on the integration of AI within a Human-Centric workflow to enhance breast cancer diagnostics. Key challenges are, however, largely overlooked such as reliance on detailed tumor annotations and susceptibility to missing views, particularly during test time. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid, multi-scale and multi-view Swin Transformer-based framework (MSMV-Swin) that enhances diagnostic robustness and accuracy. The proposed MSMV-Swin framework is designed to work as a decision-support tool, helping radiologists analyze multi-view mammograms more effectively. More specifically, the MSMV-Swin framework leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to isolate the breast lobe, reducing background noise and enabling comprehensive feature extraction. The multi-scale nature of the proposed MSMV-Swin framework accounts for tumor-specific regions as well as the spatial characteristics of tissues surrounding the tumor, capturing both localized and contextual information. The integration of contextual and localized data ensures that MSMV-Swin's outputs align with the way radiologists interpret mammograms, fostering better human-AI interaction and trust. A hybrid fusion structure is then designed to ensure robustness against missing views, a common occurrence in clinical practice when only a single mammogram view is available.

Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) to healthcare information extraction has emerged as a promising approach. This study evaluates the classification performance of five open-source LLMs: GEMMA-3-27B-IT, LLAMA3-70B, LLAMA4-109B, DEEPSEEK-R1-DISTILL-LLAMA-70B, and DEEPSEEK-V3-0324-UD-Q2_K_XL, across six healthcare-related classification tasks involving both social media data (breast cancer, changes in medication regimen, adverse pregnancy outcomes, potential COVID-19 cases) and clinical data (stigma labeling, medication change discussion). We report precision, recall, and F1 scores with 95% confidence intervals for all model-task combinations. Our findings reveal significant performance variability between LLMs, with DeepSeekV3 emerging as the strongest overall performer, achieving the highest F1 scores in four tasks. Notably, models generally performed better on social media tasks compared to clinical data tasks, suggesting potential domain-specific challenges. GEMMA-3-27B-IT demonstrated exceptionally high recall despite its smaller parameter count, while LLAMA4-109B showed surprisingly underwhelming performance compared to its predecessor LLAMA3-70B, indicating that larger parameter counts do not guarantee improved classification results. We observed distinct precision-recall trade-offs across models, with some favoring sensitivity over specificity and vice versa. These findings highlight the importance of task-specific model selection for healthcare applications, considering the particular data domain and precision-recall requirements rather than model size alone. As healthcare increasingly integrates AI-driven text classification tools, this comprehensive benchmarking provides valuable guidance for model selection and implementation while underscoring the need for continued evaluation and domain adaptation of LLMs in healthcare contexts.

Abstract: Natural products, as metabolites from microorganisms, animals, or plants, exhibit diverse biological activities, making them crucial for drug discovery. Nowadays, existing deep learning methods for natural products research primarily rely on supervised learning approaches designed for specific downstream tasks. However, such one-model-for-a-task paradigm often lacks generalizability and leaves significant room for performance improvement. Additionally, existing molecular characterization methods are not well-suited for the unique tasks associated with natural products. To address these limitations, we have pre-trained a foundation model for natural products based on their unique properties. Our approach employs a novel pretraining strategy that is especially tailored to natural products. By incorporating contrastive learning and masked graph learning objectives, we emphasize evolutional information from molecular scaffolds while capturing side-chain information. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in various downstream tasks related to natural product mining and drug discovery. We first compare taxonomy classification with synthesized molecule-focused baselines to demonstrate that current models are inadequate for understanding natural synthesis. Furthermore, by diving into a fine-grained analysis at both the gene and microbial levels, NaFM demonstrates the ability to capture evolutionary information. Eventually, our method is experimented with virtual screening, illustrating informative natural product representations that can lead to more effective identification of potential drug candidates.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in code generation tasks and have become indispensable programming assistants for developers. However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily assess the functional correctness of code generated by LLMs in single-turn interactions, offering limited insight into their capabilities to generate code that strictly follows users' instructions, especially in multi-turn interaction scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in interactive code generation. Specifically, CodeIF-Bench incorporates nine types of verifiable instructions aligned with the real-world software development requirements, which can be independently and objectively validated through specified test cases, facilitating the evaluation of instruction-following capability in multi-turn interactions. We evaluate nine prominent LLMs using CodeIF-Bench, and the experimental results reveal a significant disparity between their basic programming capability and instruction-following capability, particularly as task complexity, context length, and the number of dialogue rounds increase.

Abstract: The design of AI systems to assist human decision-making typically requires the availability of labels to train and evaluate supervised models. Frequently, however, these labels are unknown, and different ways of estimating them involve unverifiable assumptions or arbitrary choices. In this work, we introduce the concept of label indeterminacy and derive important implications in high-stakes AI-assisted decision-making. We present an empirical study in a healthcare context, focusing specifically on predicting the recovery of comatose patients after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Our study shows that label indeterminacy can result in models that perform similarly when evaluated on patients with known labels, but vary drastically in their predictions for patients where labels are unknown. After demonstrating crucial ethical implications of label indeterminacy in this high-stakes context, we discuss takeaways for evaluation, reporting, and design.

arXiv:2504.08603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometrically accurate and semantically expressive map representations have proven invaluable to facilitate robust and safe mobile robot navigation and task planning. Nevertheless, real-time, open-vocabulary semantic understanding of large-scale unknown environments is still an open problem. In this paper we present FindAnything, an open-world mapping and exploration framework that incorporates vision-language information into dense volumetric submaps. Thanks to the use of vision-language features, FindAnything bridges the gap between pure geometric and open-vocabulary semantic information for a higher level of understanding while allowing to explore any environment without the help of any external source of ground-truth pose information. We represent the environment as a series of volumetric occupancy submaps, resulting in a robust and accurate map representation that deforms upon pose updates when the underlying SLAM system corrects its drift, allowing for a locally consistent representation between submaps. Pixel-wise vision-language features are aggregated from efficient SAM (eSAM)-generated segments, which are in turn integrated into object-centric volumetric submaps, providing a mapping from open-vocabulary queries to 3D geometry that is scalable also in terms of memory usage. The open-vocabulary map representation of FindAnything achieves state-of-the-art semantic accuracy in closed-set evaluations on the Replica dataset. This level of scene understanding allows a robot to explore environments based on objects or areas of interest selected via natural language queries. Our system is the first of its kind to be deployed on resource-constrained devices, such as MAVs, leveraging vision-language information for real-world robotic tasks.

Abstract: Drones, like most airborne aerial vehicles, face inherent disadvantages in achieving agile flight due to their limited thrust capabilities. These physical constraints cannot be fully addressed through advancements in control algorithms alone. Drawing inspiration from the winged flying squirrel, this paper proposes a highly maneuverable drone equipped with agility-enhancing foldable wings. By leveraging collaborative control between the conventional propeller system and the foldable wings-coordinated through the Thrust-Wing Coordination Control (TWCC) framework-the controllable acceleration set is expanded, enabling the generation of abrupt vertical forces that are unachievable with traditional wingless drones. The complex aerodynamics of the foldable wings are modeled using a physics-assisted recurrent neural network (paRNN), which calibrates the angle of attack (AOA) to align with the real aerodynamic behavior of the wings. The additional air resistance generated by appropriately deploying these wings significantly improves the tracking performance of the proposed "flying squirrel" drone. The model is trained on real flight data and incorporates flat-plate aerodynamic principles. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed flying squirrel drone achieves a 13.1% improvement in tracking performance, as measured by root mean square error (RMSE), compared to a conventional wingless drone. A demonstration video is available on YouTube: https://youtu.be/O8nrip18azY.

arXiv:2504.10146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose GeoUni, the first unified geometry expert model capable of generating problem solutions and diagrams within a single framework in a way that enables the creation of unique and individualized geometry problems. Traditionally, solving geometry problems and generating diagrams have been treated as separate tasks in machine learning, with no models successfully integrating both to support problem creation. However, we believe that mastery in geometry requires frictionless integration of all of these skills, from solving problems to visualizing geometric relationships, and finally, crafting tailored problems. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUni, with only 1.5B parameters, achieves performance comparable to larger models such as DeepSeek-R1 with 671B parameters in geometric reasoning tasks. GeoUni also excels in generating precise geometric diagrams, surpassing both text-to-image models and unified models, including the GPT-4o image generation. Most importantly, GeoUni is the only model capable of successfully generating textual problems with matching diagrams based on specific knowledge points, thus offering a wider range of capabilities that extend beyond current models.

Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) aim to integrate multimodal understanding and generation abilities through a single framework. Despite their versatility, existing open-source unified models exhibit performance gaps against domain-specific architectures. To bridge this gap, we present Nexus-Gen, a unified model that synergizes the language reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the image synthesis power of diffusion models. To align the embedding space of the LLM and diffusion model, we conduct a dual-phase alignment training process. (1) The autoregressive LLM learns to predict image embeddings conditioned on multimodal inputs, while (2) the vision decoder is trained to reconstruct high-fidelity images from these embeddings. During training the LLM, we identified a critical discrepancy between the autoregressive paradigm's training and inference phases, where error accumulation in continuous embedding space severely degrades generation quality. To avoid this issue, we introduce a prefilled autoregression strategy that prefills input sequence with position-embedded special tokens instead of continuous embeddings. Through dual-phase training, Nexus-Gen has developed the integrated capability to comprehensively address the image understanding, generation and editing tasks. All models, datasets, and codes are published at https://github.com/modelscope/Nexus-Gen.git to facilitate further advancements across the field.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), an increasing number of benchmarks have been established to evaluate the video understanding capabilities of these models. However, these benchmarks focus on standalone videos and mainly assess "visual elements" like human actions and object states. In reality, contemporary videos often encompass complex and continuous narratives, typically presented as a series. To address this challenge, we propose SeriesBench, a benchmark consisting of 105 carefully curated narrative-driven series, covering 28 specialized tasks that require deep narrative understanding. Specifically, we first select a diverse set of drama series spanning various genres. Then, we introduce a novel long-span narrative annotation method, combined with a full-information transformation approach to convert manual annotations into diverse task formats. To further enhance model capacity for detailed analysis of plot structures and character relationships within series, we propose a novel narrative reasoning framework, PC-DCoT. Extensive results on SeriesBench indicate that existing MLLMs still face significant challenges in understanding narrative-driven series, while PC-DCoT enables these MLLMs to achieve performance improvements. Overall, our SeriesBench and PC-DCoT highlight the critical necessity of advancing model capabilities to understand narrative-driven series, guiding the future development of MLLMs. SeriesBench is publicly available at https://github.com/zackhxn/SeriesBench-CVPR2025.

<div> metric learning, goal recognition, deep learning, Siamese network, RNN

Summary:
GRAML (Goal Recognition As Metric Learning) is a new approach to goal recognition that uses a Siamese network and RNN to learn a metric over an embedding space. This enables quick adaptation to new goals by ensuring that embeddings of observation traces leading to different goals are distant, while embeddings of traces leading to the same goals are close. GRAML outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of speed, flexibility, and runtime efficiency while maintaining high accuracy in goal recognition. By treating goal recognition as a deep metric learning task, GRAML eliminates the need for manual domain models and reduces the time required for training on new goals. This approach is particularly effective in scenarios where only one example observation trace per goal is available, making it a valuable tool for automated and adaptive goal recognition in various environments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Goal Recognition (GR) is the problem of recognizing an agent's objectives based on observed actions. Recent data-driven approaches for GR alleviate the need for costly, manually crafted domain models. However, these approaches can only reason about a pre-defined set of goals, and time-consuming training is needed for new emerging goals. To keep this model-learning automated while enabling quick adaptation to new goals, this paper introduces GRAML: Goal Recognition As Metric Learning. GRAML uses a Siamese network to treat GR as a deep metric learning task, employing an RNN that learns a metric over an embedding space, where the embeddings for observation traces leading to different goals are distant, and embeddings of traces leading to the same goals are close. This metric is especially useful when adapting to new goals, even if given just one example observation trace per goal. Evaluated on a versatile set of environments, GRAML shows speed, flexibility, and runtime improvements over the state-of-the-art GR while maintaining accurate recognition.

Abstract: One of the primary aspirations in reinforcement learning research is developing general-purpose agents capable of rapidly adapting to and mastering novel tasks. While RL gaming agents have mastered many Atari games, they remain slow and costly to train for each game. In this work, we demonstrate that latest reasoning LLMs with out-of-domain RL post-training can play a challenging Atari game called Frogger under a zero-shot setting. We then investigate the effect of in-context learning and the amount of reasoning effort on LLM performance. Lastly, we demonstrate a way to bootstrap traditional RL method with LLM demonstrations, which significantly improves their performance and sample efficiency. Our implementation is open sourced at https://github.com/AlienKevin/frogger.

<br />
Narratives play a crucial role in motivating large-scale human cooperation, as observed by Yuval Noah Harari. This study investigates whether narratives can also influence the collaboration of LLM agents. Through experiments involving a public goods game with repeated interactions, agents were primed with different stories emphasizing either teamwork or self-interest. The study found that narratives significantly impact negotiation behavior, with shared stories leading to improved collaboration among agents. However, when agents were primed with conflicting narratives, those inclined towards self-interest outperformed their cooperative counterparts. The number of agents involved in the negotiation also influenced the outcomes, with larger groups exhibiting varying levels of cooperation based on priming. These findings suggest that narrative priming can shape the behavior of artificial agents in multi-agent systems, highlighting the importance of aligning AI with cooperative values.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Yuval Noah Harari, large-scale human cooperation is driven by shared narratives that encode common beliefs and values. This study explores whether such narratives can similarly nudge LLM agents toward collaboration. We use a finitely repeated public goods game in which LLM agents choose either cooperative or egoistic spending strategies. We prime agents with stories highlighting teamwork to different degrees and test how this influences negotiation outcomes. Our experiments explore four questions:(1) How do narratives influence negotiation behavior? (2) What differs when agents share the same story versus different ones? (3) What happens when the agent numbers grow? (4) Are agents resilient against self-serving negotiators? We find that story-based priming significantly affects negotiation strategies and success rates. Common stories improve collaboration, benefiting each agent. By contrast, priming agents with different stories reverses this effect, and those agents primed toward self-interest prevail. We hypothesize that these results carry implications for multi-agent system design and AI alignment.

Abstract: Emergency response services are critical to public safety, with 9-1-1 call-takers playing a key role in ensuring timely and effective emergency operations. To ensure call-taking performance consistency, quality assurance is implemented to evaluate and refine call-takers' skillsets. However, traditional human-led evaluations struggle with high call volumes, leading to low coverage and delayed assessments. We introduce LogiDebrief, an AI-driven framework that automates traditional 9-1-1 call debriefing by integrating Signal-Temporal Logic (STL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for fully-covered rigorous performance evaluation. LogiDebrief formalizes call-taking requirements as logical specifications, enabling systematic assessment of 9-1-1 calls against procedural guidelines. It employs a three-step verification process: (1) contextual understanding to identify responder types, incident classifications, and critical conditions; (2) STL-based runtime checking with LLM integration to ensure compliance; and (3) automated aggregation of results into quality assurance reports. Beyond its technical contributions, LogiDebrief has demonstrated real-world impact. Successfully deployed at Metro Nashville Department of Emergency Communications, it has assisted in debriefing 1,701 real-world calls, saving 311.85 hours of active engagement. Empirical evaluation with real-world data confirms its accuracy, while a case study and extensive user study highlight its effectiveness in enhancing call-taking performance.

<div> Keywords: AI safety, debate, alignment, honesty, research

Summary:
This paper explores the value of debate as a tool for ensuring AI safety in systems that may exceed human capabilities. It proposes using debate to identify flaws in AI outputs and steer them towards desirable traits. The paper outlines an "alignment safety case" to prevent AI systems from autonomously taking harmful actions, focusing on the risk of sabotage within AI companies. The approach involves training AI agents through debate to promote honesty and incorporating online training to maintain honesty during deployment. The safety case is based on four key claims: the agent's proficiency in the debate game, which implies honesty in the system, the system's consistency in honesty during deployment, and the tolerance for some errors in the deployment context. The paper identifies open research problems that could enhance the argument for AI system safety.

Abstract: If AI systems match or exceed human capabilities on a wide range of tasks, it may become difficult for humans to efficiently judge their actions -- making it hard to use human feedback to steer them towards desirable traits. One proposed solution is to leverage another superhuman system to point out flaws in the system's outputs via a debate. This paper outlines the value of debate for AI safety, as well as the assumptions and further research required to make debate work. It does so by sketching an ``alignment safety case'' -- an argument that an AI system will not autonomously take actions which could lead to egregious harm, despite being able to do so. The sketch focuses on the risk of an AI R\&amp;D agent inside an AI company sabotaging research, for example by producing false results. To prevent this, the agent is trained via debate, subject to exploration guarantees, to teach the system to be honest. Honesty is maintained throughout deployment via online training. The safety case rests on four key claims: (1) the agent has become good at the debate game, (2) good performance in the debate game implies that the system is mostly honest, (3) the system will not become significantly less honest during deployment, and (4) the deployment context is tolerant of some errors. We identify open research problems that, if solved, could render this a compelling argument that an AI system is safe.

This article introduces a novel Explainable AI (XAI) method to enhance the global explainability of the Isolation Forest (iForest) technique for outlier detection in machine learning. The research aims to provide a comprehensive view of the decision-making process, detailing outlier selection and decision boundaries for inliers. The method is based on the Decision Predicate Graph (DPG) to clarify the logic of ensemble methods and offers insights through the Inlier-Outlier Propagation Score (IOP-Score). By detailing how samples are identified as outliers and which features contribute to outlier identification, the proposal improves iForest's explainability and promotes a fully explainable machine learning pipeline. This approach advances the state-of-the-art by providing a holistic view of feature usage in outlier identification and explaining decision boundaries effectively. <div>

Abstract: The need to explain predictive models is well-established in modern machine learning. However, beyond model interpretability, understanding pre-processing methods is equally essential. Understanding how data modifications impact model performance improvements and potential biases and promoting a reliable pipeline is mandatory for developing robust machine learning solutions. Isolation Forest (iForest) is a widely used technique for outlier detection that performs well. Its effectiveness increases with the number of tree-based learners. However, this also complicates the explanation of outlier selection and the decision boundaries for inliers. This research introduces a novel Explainable AI (XAI) method, tackling the problem of global explainability. In detail, it aims to offer a global explanation for outlier detection to address its opaque nature. Our approach is based on the Decision Predicate Graph (DPG), which clarifies the logic of ensemble methods and provides both insights and a graph-based metric to explain how samples are identified as outliers using the proposed Inlier-Outlier Propagation Score (IOP-Score). Our proposal enhances iForest's explainability and provides a comprehensive view of the decision-making process, detailing which features contribute to outlier identification and how the model utilizes them. This method advances the state-of-the-art by providing insights into decision boundaries and a comprehensive view of holistic feature usage in outlier identification. -- thus promoting a fully explainable machine learning pipeline.

<div> Keywords: Uncertainty, Artificial Intelligence, Probabilistic Inference, First-order Logic, Tractability

Summary:
The article introduces a method for reasoning under uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence that combines expressive power with computational tractability. Drawing inspiration from human reasoning, the method extends sum-of-squares logic of expectation to relational settings, allowing for handling of hybrid variables. This approach enables lifted reasoning in the bounded-degree fragment for knowledge bases with bounded quantifier rank in polynomial time. The notion of tractability is defined in proof-theoretic terms, going beyond syntactic properties to establish completeness in sum-of-squares refutations for fixed degrees. These refutations derive the tightest bounds achievable by proofs of a given degree and size, even when faced with an a priori unknown or countably infinite set of objects. Overall, the method offers a promising framework for addressing the fundamental challenge of reasoning under uncertainty in AI. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reasoning under uncertainty is a fundamental challenge in Artificial Intelligence. As with most of these challenges, there is a harsh dilemma between the expressive power of the language used, and the tractability of the computational problem posed by reasoning. Inspired by human reasoning, we introduce a method of first-order relational probabilistic inference that satisfies both criteria, and can handle hybrid (discrete and continuous) variables. Specifically, we extend sum-of-squares logic of expectation to relational settings, demonstrating that lifted reasoning in the bounded-degree fragment for knowledge bases of bounded quantifier rank can be performed in polynomial time, even with an a priori unknown and/or countably infinite set of objects. Crucially, our notion of tractability is framed in proof-theoretic terms, which extends beyond the syntactic properties of the language or queries. We are able to derive the tightest bounds provable by proofs of a given degree and size and establish completeness in our sum-of-squares refutations for fixed degrees.

Abstract: We introduce a new architecture for Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL) that models return distributions using normalizing flows. This approach enables flexible, unbounded support for return distributions, in contrast to categorical approaches like C51 that rely on fixed or bounded representations. It also offers richer modeling capacity to capture multi-modality, skewness, and tail behavior than quantile based approaches. Our method is significantly more parameter-efficient than categorical approaches. Standard metrics used to train existing models like KL divergence or Wasserstein distance either are scale insensitive or have biased sample gradients, especially when return supports do not overlap. To address this, we propose a novel surrogate for the Cram\`er distance, that is geometry-aware and computable directly from the return distribution's PDF, avoiding the costly CDF computation. We test our model on the ATARI-5 sub-benchmark and show that our approach outperforms PDF based models while remaining competitive with quantile based methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce KERAIA, a novel framework and software platform for symbolic knowledge engineering designed to address the persistent challenges of representing, reasoning with, and executing knowledge in dynamic, complex, and context-sensitive environments. The central research question that motivates this work is: How can unstructured, often tacit, human expertise be effectively transformed into computationally tractable algorithms that AI systems can efficiently utilise? KERAIA seeks to bridge this gap by building on foundational concepts such as Minsky's frame-based reasoning and K-lines, while introducing significant innovations. These include Clouds of Knowledge for dynamic aggregation, Dynamic Relations (DRels) for context-sensitive inheritance, explicit Lines of Thought (LoTs) for traceable reasoning, and Cloud Elaboration for adaptive knowledge transformation. This approach moves beyond the limitations of traditional, often static, knowledge representation paradigms. KERAIA is designed with Explainable AI (XAI) as a core principle, ensuring transparency and interpretability, particularly through the use of LoTs. The paper details the framework's architecture, the KSYNTH representation language, and the General Purpose Paradigm Builder (GPPB) to integrate diverse inference methods within a unified structure. We validate KERAIA's versatility, expressiveness, and practical applicability through detailed analysis of multiple case studies spanning naval warfare simulation, industrial diagnostics in water treatment plants, and strategic decision-making in the game of RISK. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis against established knowledge representation paradigms (including ontologies, rule-based systems, and knowledge graphs) and discuss the implementation aspects and computational considerations of the KERAIA platform.

<div> Hierarchical Co-Self-Play, 3v3 multi-drone volleyball, reinforcement learning, hierarchical framework, decentralized control <br />
Summary: 
The paper presents a novel approach, Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), for learning to play 3v3 multi-drone volleyball. The task involves high-level strategic coordination and low-level agile control, posing challenges due to long-horizon dependencies and underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. HCSP separates centralized high-level decision-making from decentralized motion control, enabling training from scratch without expert demonstrations. The three-stage training pipeline includes diverse low-level skill training, high-level strategy learning through self-play, and joint fine-tuning via co-self-play. Experimental results show HCSP outperforms non-hierarchical and rule-based baselines, achieving an average win rate of 82.9% and 71.5% against a two-stage variant. Co-self-play results in emergent team behaviors like role switching and coordinated formations, showcasing the effectiveness of the hierarchical design and training scheme. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning to play 3v3 multi-drone volleyball, a new embodied competitive task that requires both high-level strategic coordination and low-level agile control. The task is turn-based, multi-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its long-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates centralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level motion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to enable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert demonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level strategy via self-play with fixed low-level controllers, and (III) joint fine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior performance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based hierarchical baselines with an average 82.9\% win rate and a 71.5\% win rate against the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team behaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.

Summary:
The paper discusses the importance of considering uncertainty in Machine Ethics decisions and the need to make decisions based on long-term preferable outcomes. Evaluation of outcomes may involve conflicting moral theories such as Utilitarianism, Deontology, and Virtue Ethics, each requiring different ethical representations. The formalization of the problem as a Multi-Moral Markov Decision Process and a Multi-Moral Stochastic Shortest Path Problem is presented. An algorithm based on Multi-Objective AO* and Sven-Ove Hansson's Hypothetical Retrospection procedure for ethical reasoning under uncertainty is developed. The approach is validated using a case study on the ethical dilemma of stealing insulin for someone in need.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.04352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Ethics decisions should consider the implications of uncertainty over decisions. Decisions should be made over sequences of actions to reach preferable outcomes long term. The evaluation of outcomes, however, may invoke one or more moral theories, which might have conflicting judgements. Each theory will require differing representations of the ethical situation. For example, Utilitarianism measures numerical values, Deontology analyses duties, and Virtue Ethics emphasises moral character. While balancing potentially conflicting moral considerations, decisions may need to be made, for example, to achieve morally neutral goals with minimal costs. In this paper, we formalise the problem as a Multi-Moral Markov Decision Process and a Multi-Moral Stochastic Shortest Path Problem. We develop a heuristic algorithm based on Multi-Objective AO*, utilising Sven-Ove Hansson's Hypothetical Retrospection procedure for ethical reasoning under uncertainty. Our approach is validated by a case study from Machine Ethics literature: the problem of whether to steal insulin for someone who needs it.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a crucial task in modeling human behavior, especially in fields as social robotics and autonomous vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while recently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack of explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a Statistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions. Our evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the ETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning methods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset. TrajEvo represents a first step toward automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics. We make our source code publicly available to foster future research at https://github.com/ai4co/trajevo.

<div> transposition tables, game tree, backpropagation, terminal evaluation function, heuristic function <br />
Summary: <br />
This paper presents experimental evaluations of modifications to the Unbounded Best-First Minimax algorithm. The modifications include the use of transposition tables, a different backpropagation strategy from Cohen-Solal, replacing exact terminal evaluation with a learned heuristic function, and implementing a completion technique that prioritizes resolved winning states. The evaluations show that using transposition tables can convert the game tree into a directed acyclic graph, improving performance. The backpropagation strategy by Cohen-Solal, updating values up to the root, enhances performance in certain scenarios. Replacing the terminal evaluation function with a learned heuristic function is beneficial in situations where exact evaluations are costly. Finally, implementing the completion technique that prioritizes resolved winning states also improves algorithm performance. These targeted modifications demonstrate how adjustments can enhance the efficiency of the Unbounded Best-First Minimax algorithm. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper presents the first experimental evaluation of four previously untested modifications of Unbounded Best-First Minimax algorithm. This algorithm explores the game tree by iteratively expanding the most promising sequences of actions based on the current partial game tree. We first evaluate the use of transposition tables, which convert the game tree into a directed acyclic graph by merging duplicate states. Second, we compare the original algorithm by Korf & Chickering with the variant proposed by Cohen-Solal, which differs in its backpropagation strategy: instead of stopping when a stable value is encountered, it updates values up to the root. This change slightly improves performance when value ties or transposition tables are involved. Third, we assess replacing the exact terminal evaluation function with the learned heuristic function. While beneficial when exact evaluations are costly, this modification reduces performance in inexpensive settings. Finally, we examine the impact of the completion technique that prioritizes resolved winning states and avoids resolved losing states. This technique also improves performance. Overall, our findings highlight how targeted modifications can enhance the efficiency of Unbounded Best-First Minimax.

<div> Formal Problem-Solving, Markov decision process, AI-based agents, FTP environments, D-FPS 
Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework for problem-solving, Formal Problem-Solving (FPS), which leverages existing FTP environments for process-verified problem-solving. Problem-solving is defined as a deterministic Markov decision process. The D-FPS framework separates solving and answer verification for better human alignment. Three benchmark problems are introduced: FormalMath500, MiniF2F-Solving, and PutnamBench-Solving. The RPE method is proposed for evaluating correctness through formal verification. Evaluation of four FTP models and two prompting methods shows limited success in solving the benchmarks. The frameworks exhibit soundness and completeness. The study emphasizes the importance of verifiability in problem-solving processes and aims to provide a structured approach for AI-based problem-solving agents. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.04528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a seemingly self-explanatory task, problem-solving has been a significant component of science and engineering. However, a general yet concrete formulation of problem-solving itself is missing. With the recent development of AI-based problem-solving agents, the demand for process-level verifiability is rapidly increasing yet underexplored. To fill these gaps, we present a principled formulation of problem-solving as a deterministic Markov decision process; a novel framework, FPS (Formal Problem-Solving), which utilizes existing FTP (formal theorem proving) environments to perform process-verified problem-solving; and D-FPS (Deductive FPS), decoupling solving and answer verification for better human-alignment. The expressiveness, soundness and completeness of the frameworks are proven. We construct three benchmarks on problem-solving: FormalMath500, a formalization of a subset of the MATH500 benchmark; MiniF2F-Solving and PutnamBench-Solving, adaptations of FTP benchmarks MiniF2F and PutnamBench. For faithful, interpretable, and human-aligned evaluation, we propose RPE (Restricted Propositional Equivalence), a symbolic approach to determine the correctness of answers by formal verification. We evaluate four prevalent FTP models and two prompting methods as baselines, solving at most 23.77% of FormalMath500, 27.47% of MiniF2F-Solving, and 0.31% of PutnamBench-Solving.

<div> Markov Decision Processes, RMDPs, uncertainties, reachability objectives, parity objectives <br />
Summary: 
The article introduces Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs), which handle uncertainties in transition probabilities. RMDPs consider a set of possible transition functions and aim to maximize the probability the agent can guarantee against an adversarial environment. The study focuses on qualitative analysis problems for reachability and parity objectives in RMDPs without assumptions about their structures. The research presents efficient algorithms with oracle access to uncertainty sets that address qualitative problems for reachability and parity objectives. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the oracle-based approach on classical RMDP examples, demonstrating scalability to RMDPs with thousands of states. <div>
arXiv:2505.04539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) generalize classical MDPs that consider uncertainties in transition probabilities by defining a set of possible transition functions. An objective is a set of runs (or infinite trajectories) of the RMDP, and the value for an objective is the maximal probability that the agent can guarantee against the adversarial environment. We consider (a) reachability objectives, where given a target set of states, the goal is to eventually arrive at one of them; and (b) parity objectives, which are a canonical representation for $\omega$-regular objectives. The qualitative analysis problem asks whether the objective can be ensured with probability 1.
  In this work, we study the qualitative problem for reachability and parity objectives on RMDPs without making any assumption over the structures of the RMDPs, e.g., unichain or aperiodic. Our contributions are twofold. We first present efficient algorithms with oracle access to uncertainty sets that solve qualitative problems of reachability and parity objectives. We then report experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of our oracle-based approach on classical RMDP examples from the literature scaling up to thousands of states.

<div> Keywords: AI hallucinations, misinformation, generative AI systems, communication phenomena, research agenda <br />
Summary: This paper introduces a conceptual framework that views AI hallucinations as a unique form of misinformation, distinct from intentionally created false information. AI systems can generate false but believable content without human intent, leading to social consequences. The framework considers hallucinations as communication phenomena rather than technical failures, highlighting the differences in production, perception, and institutional response compared to human-generated misinformation. The supply-and-demand model and distributed agency concept are utilized to explain these distinctions. The paper suggests a research agenda for communication scholars to examine the creation, spread, and reception of AI-generated hallucinated content at institutional, group, and individual levels. It calls for a reevaluation of misinformation theory to account for the influence of probabilistic, non-human actors in shaping knowledge dissemination.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes a conceptual framework for understanding AI hallucinations as a distinct form of misinformation. While misinformation scholarship has traditionally focused on human intent, generative AI systems now produce false yet plausible outputs absent of such intent. I argue that these AI hallucinations should not be treated merely as technical failures but as communication phenomena with social consequences. Drawing on a supply-and-demand model and the concept of distributed agency, the framework outlines how hallucinations differ from human-generated misinformation in production, perception, and institutional response. I conclude by outlining a research agenda for communication scholars to investigate the emergence, dissemination, and audience reception of hallucinated content, with attention to macro (institutional), meso (group), and micro (individual) levels. This work urges communication researchers to rethink the boundaries of misinformation theory in light of probabilistic, non-human actors increasingly embedded in knowledge production.

The article introduces AccLLM, an acceleration framework designed to optimize the deployment of large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices. The challenges of deploying LLMs on edge devices include intensive computations, large model sizes, memory and bandwidth demands, and limited scalability for handling long sequences. To address these challenges, AccLLM integrates pruning, Lambda-shaped attention, and a novel quantization scheme to reduce memory and bandwidth requirements while improving long-sequence generation. At the hardware level, a dedicated FPGA-based accelerator with a reconfigurable computing engine is designed to efficiently accommodate various operations stemming from the compression algorithm.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved huge success in the natural language processing (NLP) field, driving a growing demand to extend their deployment from the cloud to edge devices. However, deploying LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices poses significant challenges, including (1) intensive computations and huge model sizes, (2) great memory and bandwidth demands introduced by the autoregressive generation process, and (3) limited scalability for handling long sequences. To address these challenges, we propose AccLLM, a comprehensive acceleration framework that enables efficient and fast long-context LLM inference through algorithm and hardware co-design. At the algorithmic level, we integrate (1) pruning, (2) {\Lambda}-shaped attention, and (3) an innovative W2A8KV4 (2-bit weights, 8-bit activations, and 4-bit KV cache) quantization scheme, thus effectively reducing memory and bandwidth requirements while facilitating LLMs' long-sequence generation. At the hardware level, we design a dedicated FPGA-based accelerator with a reconfigurable computing engine to effectively and flexibly accommodate diverse operations arising from our compression algorithm, thereby fully translating the algorithmic innovations into tangible hardware efficiency. We validate AccLLM on the Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA, demonstrating a 4.07x energy efficiency and a 2.98x throughput compared to the state-of-the-art work FlightLLM.

Abstract: Social media platforms enable instant and ubiquitous connectivity and are essential to social interaction and communication in our technological society. Apart from its advantages, these platforms have given rise to negative behaviors in the online community, the so-called cyberbullying. Despite the many works involving generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the literature lately, there remain opportunities to study its performance apart from zero/few-shot learning strategies. Accordingly, we propose an innovative and real-time solution for cyberbullying detection that leverages stream-based Machine Learning (ML) models able to process the incoming samples incrementally and Large Language Models (LLMS) for feature engineering to address the evolving nature of abusive and hate speech online. An explainability dashboard is provided to promote the system's trustworthiness, reliability, and accountability. Results on experimental data report promising performance close to 90 % in all evaluation metrics and surpassing those obtained by competing works in the literature. Ultimately, our proposal contributes to the safety of online communities by timely detecting abusive behavior to prevent long-lasting harassment and reduce the negative consequences in society.

APSQ is a novel method introduced in this study to address the excessive memory demands caused by high-precision partial sums (PSUMs) in DNN accelerators. By integrating PSUM accumulation into the quantization framework, APSQ achieves nearly lossless performance on NLP and CV tasks across various models while compressing PSUMs to INT8. The proposed grouping strategy, which combines APSQ with PSUM quantization in a reconfigurable architecture, results in significant energy cost reductions of 28-87%. The study also demonstrates the effectiveness of APSQ for large language models through experiments on LLaMA2-7B. The code for APSQ implementation is available on GitHub for further exploration and development. <div>

Abstract: DNN accelerators, significantly advanced by model compression and specialized dataflow techniques, have marked considerable progress. However, the frequent access of high-precision partial sums (PSUMs) leads to excessive memory demands in architectures utilizing input/weight stationary dataflows. Traditional compression strategies have typically overlooked PSUM quantization, which may account for 69% of power consumption. This study introduces a novel Additive Partial Sum Quantization (APSQ) method, seamlessly integrating PSUM accumulation into the quantization framework. A grouping strategy that combines APSQ with PSUM quantization enhanced by a reconfigurable architecture is further proposed. The APSQ performs nearly lossless on NLP and CV tasks across BERT, Segformer, and EfficientViT models while compressing PSUMs to INT8. This leads to a notable reduction in energy costs by 28-87%. Extended experiments on LLaMA2-7B demonstrate the potential of APSQ for large language models. Code is available at https://github.com/Yonghao-Tan/APSQ.

Summary:
FASTLIBRA is introduced as a Multi-LoRA caching system that aims to optimize serving performance by considering usage dependencies when caching LoRAs and KV caches. It consists of a dependency-aware cache manager and a performance-driven cache swapper. The cache manager maintains usage dependencies between LoRAs and KV caches in a unified caching pool during inference. The cache swapper decides when to swap in or out LoRAs and KV caches based on a unified cost model and the availability of high bandwidth memory (HBM). Experimental results demonstrate that FASTLIBRA significantly reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by 63.4% on average compared to existing methods, showcasing its effectiveness in improving inference performance for task-specific Large Language Model applications. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Multiple Low-Rank Adapters (Multi-LoRAs) are gaining popularity for task-specific Large Language Model (LLM) applications. For multi-LoRA serving, caching hot KV caches and LoRA adapters in high bandwidth memory of accelerations can improve inference performance. However, existing Multi-LoRA inference systems fail to optimize serving performance like Time-To-First-Toke (TTFT), neglecting usage dependencies when caching LoRAs and KVs. We therefore propose FASTLIBRA, a Multi-LoRA caching system to optimize the serving performance. FASTLIBRA comprises a dependency-aware cache manager and a performance-driven cache swapper. The cache manager maintains the usage dependencies between LoRAs and KV caches during the inference with a unified caching pool. The cache swapper determines the swap-in or out of LoRAs and KV caches based on a unified cost model, when the HBM is idle or busy, respectively. Experimental results show that ELORA reduces the TTFT by 63.4% on average, compared to state-of-the-art works.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization requires dynamic allocation of funds by balancing the risk and return tradeoff under dynamic market conditions. With the recent advancements in AI, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has gained prominence in providing adaptive and scalable strategies for portfolio optimization. However, the success of these strategies depends not only on their ability to adapt to market dynamics but also on the careful pre-selection of assets that influence overall portfolio performance. Incorporating the investor's preference in pre-selecting assets for a portfolio is essential in refining their investment strategies. This study proposes a volatility-guided DRL-based portfolio optimization framework that dynamically constructs portfolios based on investors' risk profiles. The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model is utilized for volatility forecasting of stocks and categorizes them based on their volatility as aggressive, moderate, and conservative. The DRL agent is then employed to learn an optimal investment policy by interacting with the historical market data. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is established using stocks from the Dow $30$ index. The proposed investor-specific DRL-based portfolios outperformed the baseline strategies by generating consistent risk-adjusted returns.

<div> methodology, LLM inference, GPU, memory access, cache utilization

Summary:
Splitwiser proposes a methodology for efficient inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) by splitting the prompt computation and token generation phases onto the same GPU. This approach aims to reduce overhead, improve memory access, and enhance cache utilization during LLM inference. By eliminating the need for data transfer across devices, Splitwiser minimizes network-related overheads. The methodology is implemented on two popular LLM architectures, Huggingface, and vLLM, with the code being open-sourced for both implementations. Preliminary results and analysis show promising outcomes in optimizing LLM inference processes on GPUs. <div>

Abstract: Efficient inference of LLMs remains a crucial challenge, with two main phases: a compute-intensive prompt computation and a memory-intensive token generation. Despite existing batching and scheduling techniques, token generation phases fail to fully utilize compute resources, especially when compared to prompt computation phases. To address these challenges, we propose Splitwiser, a methodology that splits the two phases of an LLM inference request onto the same GPU, thereby reducing overhead and improving memory access and cache utilization. By eliminating the need to transfer data across devices, Splitwiser aims to minimize network-related overheads. In this report, we describe the basic structure of our proposed pipeline while sharing preliminary results and analysis. We implement our proposed multiprocessing design on two widely-used and independent LLM architectures: Huggingface and vLLM. We open-source our code for the respective implementations: 1) Huggingface (https://github.com/asad-aali/splitwiser), and 2) vLLM (https://github.com/adney11/vllm-sysml).

Summary:<br />
This study compares three spiking neuron circuit architectures - Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), Morris-Lecar (ML), and Axon-Hillock (AH) - implemented in a 7 nm FinFET technology. The Axon-Hillock design demonstrated the highest throughput with firing rates up to 3 GHz and low energy costs. The Morris-Lecar architecture excelled in low-power operation and biological bursting behavior. The Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire design showed benefits for high-frequency operation but had slightly higher static leakage. The 7 nm FinFET technology significantly improved energy efficiency and speed compared to previous node implementations, despite increased subthreshold leakage. By analyzing the design trade-offs for each architecture, this work provides insights for optimizing spiking neuron circuits in advanced nanoscale technologies to achieve neuromorphic hardware capable of ultra-low-power operation and high computational throughput.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aims to replicate the brain's remarkable energy efficiency and parallel processing capabilities for large-scale artificial intelligence applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative study of three spiking neuron circuit architectures-Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), Morris-Lecar (ML), and Axon-Hillock (AH)-implemented in a 7 nm FinFET technology. Through extensive SPICE simulations, we explore the optimization of spiking frequency, energy per spike, and static power consumption. Our results show that the AH design achieves the highest throughput, demonstrating multi-gigahertz firing rates (up to 3 GHz) with attojoule energy costs. By contrast, the ML architecture excels in subthreshold to near-threshold regimes, offering robust low-power operation (as low as 0.385 aJ/spike) and biological bursting behavior. Although LIF benefits from a decoupled current mirror for high-frequency operation, it exhibits slightly higher static leakage compared to ML and AH at elevated supply voltages. Comparisons with previous node implementations (22 nm planar, 28 nm) reveal that 7 nm FinFETs can drastically boost energy efficiency and speed albeit at the cost of increased subthreshold leakage in deep subthreshold regions. By quantifying design trade-offs for each neuron architecture, our work provides a roadmap for optimizing spiking neuron circuits in advanced nanoscale technologies to deliver neuromorphic hardware capable of both ultra-low-power operation and high computational throughput.

Abstract: In today's cross-platform social media landscape, understanding factors that drive engagement for multimodal content, especially text paired with visuals, remains complex. This study investigates how rewriting Reddit post titles adapted from YouTube video titles affects user engagement. First, we build and analyze a large dataset of Reddit posts sharing YouTube videos, revealing that 21% of post titles are minimally modified. Statistical analysis demonstrates that title rewrites measurably improve engagement. Second, we design a controlled, multi-phase experiment to rigorously isolate the effects of textual variations by neutralizing confounding factors like video popularity, timing, and community norms. Comprehensive statistical tests reveal that effective title rewrites tend to feature emotional resonance, lexical richness, and alignment with community-specific norms. Lastly, pairwise ranking prediction experiments using a fine-tuned BERT classifier achieves 74% accuracy, significantly outperforming near-random baselines, including GPT-4o. These results validate that our controlled dataset effectively minimizes confounding effects, allowing advanced models to both learn and demonstrate the impact of textual features on engagement. By bridging quantitative rigor with qualitative insights, this study uncovers engagement dynamics and offers a robust framework for future cross-platform, multimodal content strategies.

Summary: <br />
The article discusses the importance of co-designing algorithms, software, and hardware for achieving optimal performance in Large Language Models (LLMs). It highlights the limitations of relying on a single dominant platform, leading to vendor lock-in and hindering the development of new AI hardware. The authors propose a solution that combines just-in-time (JIT) compilation with kernel parameter autotuning to enable portable and state-of-the-art performance in LLM execution without requiring code changes. By focusing on flash attention, a critical LLM kernel, the approach explores a significantly higher number of kernel parameter configurations, generates more diverse code, and even surpasses vendor-optimized implementations. Moreover, the proposed method reduces kernel code size by a substantial margin and eliminates the need for manual code optimizations. The results indicate that autotuning shows promise in promoting model portability across different GPU vendors. <br /> <div>

Abstract: As LLMs grow in complexity, achieving state-of-the-art performance requires tight co-design across algorithms, software, and hardware. Today's reliance on a single dominant platform limits portability, creates vendor lock-in, and raises barriers for new AI hardware. In this work, we make the case for combining just-in-time (JIT) compilation with kernel parameter autotuning to enable portable, state-of-the-art performance LLM execution without code changes. Focusing on flash attention -- a widespread performance-critical LLM kernel -- we demonstrate that this approach explores up to 15x more kernel parameter configurations, produces significantly more diverse code across multiple dimensions, and even outperforms vendor-optimized implementations by up to 230%, all while reducing kernel code size by 70x and eliminating manual code optimizations. Our results highlight autotuning as a promising path to unlocking model portability across GPU vendors.

Summary:
Cardiac arrhythmias are a significant health concern, necessitating accurate and timely detection for prevention of life-threatening events. While electrocardiography (ECG) is the gold standard for diagnosis, manual interpretation is laborious and error-prone. Deep learning has improved automated ECG analysis, but existing models often lack interpretability and are computationally intensive. This study introduces two lightweight 1D convolutional neural networks, ArrhythmiNet V1 and V2, designed for real-time arrhythmia classification on resource-constrained devices. These models achieve high accuracy while maintaining small memory footprints. Additionally, the inclusion of interpretability techniques like Shapley Additive Explanations and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping enhances clinical transparency by revealing physiologically meaningful patterns. The study also addresses the trade-offs between performance and efficiency, highlighting the importance of dataset diversity and generalizability in wearable ECG monitoring systems. Overall, the research demonstrates the feasibility of combining interpretability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency in practical cardiac monitoring solutions.

Abstract: Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of life-threatening cardiac events, highlighting the urgent need for accurate and timely detection. Electrocardiography (ECG) remains the clinical gold standard for arrhythmia diagnosis; however, manual interpretation is time-consuming, dependent on clinical expertise, and prone to human error. Although deep learning has advanced automated ECG analysis, many existing models abstract away the signal's intrinsic temporal and morphological features, lack interpretability, and are computationally intensive-hindering their deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this work, we propose two novel lightweight 1D convolutional neural networks, ArrhythmiNet V1 and V2, optimized for efficient, real-time arrhythmia classification on edge devices. Inspired by MobileNet's depthwise separable convolutional design, these models maintain memory footprints of just 302.18 KB and 157.76 KB, respectively, while achieving classification accuracies of 0.99 (V1) and 0.98 (V2) on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset across five classes: Normal Sinus Rhythm, Left Bundle Branch Block, Right Bundle Branch Block, Atrial Premature Contraction, and Premature Ventricular Contraction. In order to ensure clinical transparency and relevance, we integrate Shapley Additive Explanations and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, enabling both local and global interpretability. These techniques highlight physiologically meaningful patterns such as the QRS complex and T-wave that contribute to the model's predictions. We also discuss performance-efficiency trade-offs and address current limitations related to dataset diversity and generalizability. Overall, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of combining interpretability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency in practical, wearable, and embedded ECG monitoring systems.

<div> Keywords: uncertainty quantification, multi-modal language models, calibration, cross-modal consistency, temperature scaling

Summary:
This article introduces a new approach for calibrating uncertainty quantification in multi-modal large language models (LLMs). Current methods for uncertainty quantification often lack calibration when the model consistently generates incorrect responses, leading to inaccuracies in confidence levels. To address this issue, the proposed approach utilizes cross-modal consistency alongside self-consistency to improve calibration. By grounding textual responses to visual inputs and incorporating confidence from a grounding model, the overall confidence is calibrated. Temperature scaling is applied to calibrate the grounding model's confidence. The approach is evaluated on tasks such as medical question answering and visual question answering using multi-modal models like LLaVA-Med and LLaVA, resulting in significantly improved calibration on both tasks. <div>

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for calibrating uncertainty quantification (UQ) tailored for multi-modal large language models (LLMs). Existing state-of-the-art UQ methods rely on consistency among multiple responses generated by the LLM on an input query under diverse settings. However, these approaches often report higher confidence in scenarios where the LLM is consistently incorrect. This leads to a poorly calibrated confidence with respect to accuracy. To address this, we leverage cross-modal consistency in addition to self-consistency to improve the calibration of the multi-modal models. Specifically, we ground the textual responses to the visual inputs. The confidence from the grounding model is used to calibrate the overall confidence. Given that using a grounding model adds its own uncertainty in the pipeline, we apply temperature scaling - a widely accepted parametric calibration technique - to calibrate the grounding model's confidence in the accuracy of generated responses. We evaluate the proposed approach across multiple multi-modal tasks, such as medical question answering (Slake) and visual question answering (VQAv2), considering multi-modal models such as LLaVA-Med and LLaVA. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly improved calibration on both tasks.

The article introduces a method combining Diffusion and Transformer models to augment time-series data for deep neural network training. By using a diffusion denoising model to generate initial action data and a Transformer model for predicting subsequent actions, augmented data is produced effectively. A weighted loss function aids in achieving convergence. The method demonstrates improved model performance with augmented data compared to traditional methods. This approach addresses the lack of focus on augmenting time-series data, a gap in current data augmentation techniques. <div>

Abstract: With the development of Artificial Intelligence, numerous real-world tasks have been accomplished using technology integrated with deep learning. To achieve optimal performance, deep neural networks typically require large volumes of data for training. Although advances in data augmentation have facilitated the acquisition of vast datasets, most of this data is concentrated in domains like images and speech. However, there has been relatively less focus on augmenting time-series data. To address this gap and generate a substantial amount of time-series data, we propose a simple and effective method that combines the Diffusion and Transformer models. By utilizing an adjusted diffusion denoising model to generate a large volume of initial time-step action data, followed by employing a Transformer model to predict subsequent actions, and incorporating a weighted loss function to achieve convergence, the method demonstrates its effectiveness. Using the performance improvement of the model after applying augmented data as a benchmark, and comparing the results with those obtained without data augmentation or using traditional data augmentation methods, this approach shows its capability to produce high-quality augmented data.

Abstract: Online fine-tuning vision-language model (VLM) agents with reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise for equipping agents with multi-step, goal-oriented capabilities in dynamic environments. However, their open-ended textual action space and non-end-to-end nature of action generation present significant challenges to effective online exploration in RL, e.g., explosion of the exploration space. We propose a novel online fine-tuning method, Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning (CoSo), better suited to the textual output space of VLM agents. Compared to prior methods that assign uniform uncertainty to all tokens, CoSo leverages counterfactual reasoning to dynamically assess the causal influence of individual tokens on post-processed actions. By prioritizing the exploration of action-critical tokens while reducing the impact of semantically redundant or low-impact tokens, CoSo enables a more targeted and efficient online rollout process. We provide theoretical analysis proving CoSo's convergence and policy improvement guarantees, and extensive empirical evaluations supporting CoSo's effectiveness. Our results across a diverse set of agent tasks, including Android device control, card gaming, and embodied AI, highlight its remarkable ability to enhance exploration efficiency and deliver consistent performance gains.

Abstract: The proliferation of open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse downstream tasks necessitates efficient model selection, given the impracticality of fine-tuning all candidates due to computational constraints. Despite the recent advances in LLM selection, a fundamental research question largely remains nascent: how can we model the dynamic behaviors of LLMs during fine-tuning, thereby enhancing our understanding of their generalization performance across diverse downstream tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that provides a proper lens to assess the generalization capabilities of LLMs, thereby enabling accurate and efficient LLM selection for downstream applications. In particular, we first derive a Hessian-based PAC-Bayes generalization bound that unveils fine-tuning dynamics of LLMs and then introduce LENSLLM, a Neural Tangent Kernel(NTK)-based Rectified Scaling Model that enables accurate performance predictions across diverse tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive empirical results on 3 large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves up to 91.1% accuracy and reduces up to 88.5% computational cost in LLM selection, outperforming 5 state-of-the-art methods. We open-source our proposed LENSLLM model and corresponding results at the Github link: https://github.com/Susan571/LENSLLM.git.

Summary:
Human networks play a crucial role in societal outcomes, and understanding them is essential for promoting positive results. In the study, various modeling methods were compared in the Junior High Game (JHG) to learn models of human behavior in a strategic network game. The highest-performing method, hCAB, modeled the population's distribution and assumed community-aware behavior, which closely mirrored human group dynamics in small societies. A user study showed that humans could not distinguish hCAB agents from real humans, indicating that hCAB behavior plausibly reflects human behavior in the game. This research provides insights into the importance of considering community-aware behavior and population distribution when modeling human networks in strategic games. <div>

Abstract: Human networks greatly impact important societal outcomes, including wealth and health inequality, poverty, and bullying. As such, understanding human networks is critical to learning how to promote favorable societal outcomes. As a step toward better understanding human networks, we compare and contrast several methods for learning models of human behavior in a strategic network game called the Junior High Game (JHG). These modeling methods differ with respect to the assumptions they use to parameterize human behavior (behavior vs. community-aware behavior) and the statistical moments they model (mean vs. distribution). Results show that the highest-performing method models the population's distribution rather than the mean and assumes humans use community-aware behavior rather than behavior matching. When applied to small societies (6-11 individuals), this learned model, called hCAB, closely mirrors the population dynamics of human groups (with some differences). Additionally, a user study reveals that human participants were unable to distinguish hCAB agents from other humans, thus illustrating that individual hCAB behavior plausibly mirrors human behavior in this strategic network game.

Abstract: Insider threats pose a significant challenge to organizational security, often evading traditional rule-based detection systems due to their subtlety and contextual nature. This paper presents an AI-powered Insider Risk Management (IRM) system that integrates behavioral analytics, dynamic risk scoring, and real-time policy enforcement to detect and mitigate insider threats with high accuracy and adaptability. We introduce a hybrid scoring mechanism - transitioning from the static PRISM model to an adaptive AI-based model utilizing an autoencoder neural network trained on expert-annotated user activity data. Through iterative feedback loops and continuous learning, the system reduces false positives by 59% and improves true positive detection rates by 30%, demonstrating substantial gains in detection precision. Additionally, the platform scales efficiently, processing up to 10 million log events daily with sub-300ms query latency, and supports automated enforcement actions for policy violations, reducing manual intervention. The IRM system's deployment resulted in a 47% reduction in incident response times, highlighting its operational impact. Future enhancements include integrating explainable AI, federated learning, graph-based anomaly detection, and alignment with Zero Trust principles to further elevate its adaptability, transparency, and compliance-readiness. This work establishes a scalable and proactive framework for mitigating emerging insider risks in both on-premises and hybrid environments.

<div> Keywords: foundation models, multimodal data, digital twin representations, semantic coherence, causal reasoning

Summary:
Current foundation models (FMs) in machine learning rely on token representations that fragment multimodal data into discrete tokens, limiting their ability to capture real-world knowledge and relationships. This approach hinders the models' performance in maintaining semantic coherence, capturing spatial-temporal dynamics, and conducting causal reasoning. Scaling up model size or expanding datasets does not address these limitations. This position paper advocates for using digital twin (DT) representations, which are outcome-driven digital representations of physical processes, as an alternative to token representations for building FMs. DT representations provide physically grounded, domain knowledge-encoded representations that preserve the continuous nature of real-world processes. By leveraging DT representations, FMs can overcome their current challenges and enhance their performance in various tasks requiring multimodal data processing.

Abstract: Current foundation models (FMs) rely on token representations that directly fragment continuous real-world multimodal data into discrete tokens. They limit FMs to learning real-world knowledge and relationships purely through statistical correlation rather than leveraging explicit domain knowledge. Consequently, current FMs struggle with maintaining semantic coherence across modalities, capturing fine-grained spatial-temporal dynamics, and performing causal reasoning. These limitations cannot be overcome by simply scaling up model size or expanding datasets. This position paper argues that the machine learning community should consider digital twin (DT) representations, which are outcome-driven digital representations that serve as building blocks for creating virtual replicas of physical processes, as an alternative to the token representation for building FMs. Finally, we discuss how DT representations can address these challenges by providing physically grounded representations that explicitly encode domain knowledge and preserve the continuous nature of real-world processes.

Summary:
SDM-InstructGLM is a novel framework that enhances the scalability and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing graph structures. It introduces a biased random walk mechanism based on node-feature similarity and degree centrality to selectively sample and encode information, improving token efficiency and performance on tasks such as node classification and link prediction. This approach allows for LLM-only graph processing without the need for Graph Neural Networks, leading to scalable and interpretable Graph Language Models (GLMs) that can be optimized through instruction-based fine-tuning. By enabling standalone graph reasoning models, this work offers a promising alternative to GNN-based approaches in graph learning. The source code for the framework is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in various natural language processing tasks; however, their application to graph-related problems remains limited, primarily due to scalability constraints and the absence of dedicated mechanisms for processing graph structures. Existing approaches predominantly integrate LLMs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), using GNNs as feature encoders or auxiliary components. However, directly encoding graph structures within LLMs has been underexplored, particularly in the context of large-scale graphs where token limitations hinder effective representation. To address these challenges, we propose SDM-InstructGLM, a novel instruction-tuned Graph Language Model (InstructGLM) framework that enhances scalability and efficiency without relying on GNNs. Our method introduces a similarity-degree-based biased random walk mechanism, which selectively samples and encodes graph information based on node-feature similarity and degree centrality, ensuring an adaptive and structured representation within the LLM. This approach significantly improves token efficiency, mitigates information loss due to random sampling, and enhances performance on graph-based tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the feasibility of LLM-only graph processing, enabling scalable and interpretable Graph Language Models (GLMs) optimized through instruction-based fine-tuning. This work paves the way for GNN-free approaches to graph learning, leveraging LLMs as standalone graph reasoning models. Our source code is available on GitHub.

- Utilized robust principal component analysis in the first stage to decompose weight matrices into low-rank and sparse components.
- Introduced a probabilistic global optimization technique in the second stage to jointly identify low-rank and sparse structures.

Abstract: Low-rank and sparse composite approximation is a natural idea to compress Large Language Models (LLMs). However, such an idea faces two primary challenges that adversely affect the performance of existing methods. The first challenge relates to the interaction and cooperation between low-rank and sparse matrices, while the second involves determining weight allocation across different layers, as redundancy varies considerably among them. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage LLM compression method with the capability of global rank and sparsity optimization. It is noteworthy that the overall optimization space is vast, making comprehensive optimization computationally prohibitive. Therefore, to reduce the optimization space, our first stage utilizes robust principal component analysis to decompose the weight matrices of LLMs into low-rank and sparse components, which span the low dimensional and sparse spaces containing the resultant low-rank and sparse matrices, respectively. In the second stage, we propose a probabilistic global optimization technique to jointly identify the low-rank and sparse structures within the above two spaces. The appealing feature of our approach is its ability to automatically detect the redundancy across different layers and to manage the interaction between the sparse and low-rank components. Extensive experimental results indicate that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art techniques for sparsification and composite approximation.

Summary:   
QR-Adaptor proposes a unified strategy for fine-tuning large language models by jointly optimizing quantization components and low-rank spaces based on partial calibration data. Unlike previous methods, QR-Adaptor considers the synergy between precision and rank allocation, enhancing model performance continuously. By treating the precision and rank allocation as a discrete optimization problem guided by downstream performance and memory usage, QR-Adaptor achieves a 4.89% accuracy improvement on GSM8K compared to state-of-the-art quantized LoRA fine-tuning methods. The approach even surpasses the performance of a 16-bit fine-tuned model while maintaining the memory footprint of the 4-bit setting. QR-Adaptor's unique approach to dynamic mixed precision provides a memory-friendly solution for optimizing quantized large language models.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: QLoRA effectively combines low-bit quantization and LoRA to achieve memory-friendly fine-tuning for large language models (LLM). Recently, methods based on SVD for continuous update iterations to initialize LoRA matrices to accommodate quantization errors have generally failed to consistently improve performance. Dynamic mixed precision is a natural idea for continuously improving the fine-tuning performance of quantized models, but previous methods often optimize low-rank subspaces or quantization components separately, without considering their synergy. To address this, we propose \textbf{QR-Adaptor}, a unified, gradient-free strategy that uses partial calibration data to jointly search the quantization components and the rank of low-rank spaces for each layer, thereby continuously improving model performance. QR-Adaptor does not minimize quantization error but treats precision and rank allocation as a discrete optimization problem guided by actual downstream performance and memory usage. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) quantized LoRA fine-tuning methods, our approach achieves a 4.89\% accuracy improvement on GSM8K, and in some cases even outperforms the 16-bit fine-tuned model while maintaining the memory footprint of the 4-bit setting.

<div> Keyword: RWKV, Post Training Quantization, Transformer, resource-constrained devices, performance degradation

Summary:
RWKVQuant is a novel Post Training Quantization (PTQ) framework designed specifically for RWKV models. It addresses the challenges faced by RWKV models when deployed to resource-constrained devices. The framework consists of two key techniques: a coarse-to-fine proxy for adaptively selecting quantization approaches based on weight properties, and a codebook optimization algorithm for cluster-based quantization methods. These techniques enable RWKVQuant to quantize RWKV-6-14B model into about 3-bit with less than 1% accuracy loss and 2.14x speed up. The challenges identified in RWKV models include non-linear operators hindering parameter-fusion and a larger amount of uniformly distributed weights affecting cluster-based quantization. Through experimental results, RWKVQuant demonstrates significantly improved performance compared to traditional PTQ methods when applied to RWKV models. Overall, RWKVQuant provides an efficient solution for reducing model size and inference latency while maintaining high accuracy in RWKV models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: RWKV is a modern RNN architecture with comparable performance to Transformer, but still faces challenges when deployed to resource-constrained devices. Post Training Quantization (PTQ), which is a an essential technique to reduce model size and inference latency, has been widely used in Transformer models. However, it suffers significant degradation of performance when applied to RWKV. This paper investigates and identifies two key constraints inherent in the properties of RWKV: (1) Non-linear operators hinder the parameter-fusion of both smooth- and rotation-based quantization, introducing extra computation overhead. (2) The larger amount of uniformly distributed weights poses challenges for cluster-based quantization, leading to reduced accuracy. To this end, we propose RWKVQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for RWKV models, consisting of two novel techniques: (1) a coarse-to-fine proxy capable of adaptively selecting different quantization approaches by assessing the uniformity and identifying outliers in the weights, and (2) a codebook optimization algorithm that enhances the performance of cluster-based quantization methods for element-wise multiplication in RWKV. Experiments show that RWKVQuant can quantize RWKV-6-14B into about 3-bit with less than 1% accuracy loss and 2.14x speed up.

Summary:
Expert-Balanced Self-Sampling (EBSS) and Affinity-Guided Quantization (AGQ) are proposed in the MoEQuant framework for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language models to address challenges in post-training quantization (PTQ). MoE models face memory overheads that limit deployment and adoption due to inter- and intra-expert imbalance. EBSS balances expert distributions in the calibration set, while AGQ considers sample-expert affinities in the quantization process. Experiments show that MoEQuant significantly improves performance, with a more than 10-point accuracy gain in HumanEval for DeepSeekMoE-16B under 4-bit quantization. This novel framework enhances efficiency and scalability of MoE LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language models (LLMs), which leverage dynamic routing and sparse activation to enhance efficiency and scalability, have achieved higher performance while reducing computational costs. However, these models face significant memory overheads, limiting their practical deployment and broader adoption. Post-training quantization (PTQ), a widely used method for compressing LLMs, encounters severe accuracy degradation and diminished generalization performance when applied to MoE models. This paper investigates the impact of MoE's sparse and dynamic characteristics on quantization and identifies two primary challenges: (1) Inter-expert imbalance, referring to the uneven distribution of samples across experts, which leads to insufficient and biased calibration for less frequently utilized experts; (2) Intra-expert imbalance, arising from MoE's unique aggregation mechanism, which leads to varying degrees of correlation between different samples and their assigned experts. To address these challenges, we propose MoEQuant, a novel quantization framework tailored for MoE LLMs. MoE-Quant includes two novel techniques: 1) Expert-Balanced Self-Sampling (EBSS) is an efficient sampling method that efficiently constructs a calibration set with balanced expert distributions by leveraging the cumulative probabilities of tokens and expert balance metrics as guiding factors. 2) Affinity-Guided Quantization (AGQ), which incorporates affinities between experts and samples into the quantization process, thereby accurately assessing the impact of individual samples on different experts within the MoE layer. Experiments demonstrate that MoEQuant achieves substantial performance gains (more than 10 points accuracy gain in the HumanEval for DeepSeekMoE-16B under 4-bit quantization) and boosts efficiency.

Abstract: This article introduces Perception-Informed Neural Networks (PrINNs), a framework designed to incorporate perception-based information into neural networks, addressing both systems with known and unknown physics laws or differential equations. Moreover, PrINNs extend the concept of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and their variants, offering a platform for the integration of diverse forms of perception precisiation, including singular, probability distribution, possibility distribution, interval, and fuzzy graph. In fact, PrINNs allow neural networks to model dynamical systems by integrating expert knowledge and perception-based information through loss functions, enabling the creation of modern data-driven models. Some of the key contributions include Mixture of Experts Informed Neural Networks (MOEINNs), which combine heterogeneous expert knowledge into the network, and Transformed-Knowledge Informed Neural Networks (TKINNs), which facilitate the incorporation of meta-information for enhanced model performance. Additionally, Fuzzy-Informed Neural Networks (FINNs) as a modern class of fuzzy deep neural networks leverage fuzzy logic constraints within a deep learning architecture, allowing online training without pre-training and eliminating the need for defuzzification. PrINNs represent a significant step forward in bridging the gap between traditional physics-based modeling and modern data-driven approaches, enabling neural networks to learn from both structured physics laws and flexible perception-based rules. This approach empowers neural networks to operate in uncertain environments, model complex systems, and discover new forms of differential equations, making PrINNs a powerful tool for advancing computational science and engineering.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel online data training framework that integrates dynamic data selection and augmentation. By estimating each sample's local density and semantic consistency, the method allows for targeted selection of samples suitable for augmentation while filtering out noisy or ambiguous data. This approach enables significant dataset size reduction without sacrificing model generalization. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on various datasets and architectures, achieving a 50% reduction in training costs on ImageNet-1k without compromising performance. Additionally, the method enhances noise resistance and improves model robustness, demonstrating its practical utility in real-world scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Dynamic data selection aims to accelerate training with lossless performance. However, reducing training data inherently limits data diversity, potentially hindering generalization. While data augmentation is widely used to enhance diversity, it is typically not optimized in conjunction with selection. As a result, directly combining these techniques fails to fully exploit their synergies. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel online data training framework that, for the first time, unifies dynamic data selection and augmentation, achieving both training efficiency and enhanced performance. Our method estimates each sample's joint distribution of local density and multimodal semantic consistency, allowing for the targeted selection of augmentation-suitable samples while suppressing the inclusion of noisy or ambiguous data. This enables a more significant reduction in dataset size without sacrificing model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on various benchmark datasets and architectures, e.g., reducing 50\% training costs on ImageNet-1k with lossless performance. Furthermore, our approach enhances noise resistance and improves model robustness, reinforcing its practical utility in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces ScarceGAN which focuses on identification of extremely rare or scarce samples from multi-dimensional longitudinal telemetry data with small and weak label prior. We specifically address: (i) severe scarcity in positive class, stemming from both underlying organic skew in the data, as well as extremely limited labels; (ii) multi-class nature of the negative samples, with uneven density distributions and partially overlapping feature distributions; and (iii) massively unlabelled data leading to tiny and weak prior on both positive and negative classes, and possibility of unseen or unknown behavior in the unlabelled set, especially in the negative class. Although related to PU learning problems, we contend that knowledge (or lack of it) on the negative class can be leveraged to learn the compliment of it (i.e., the positive class) better in a semi-supervised manner. To this effect, ScarceGAN re-formulates semi-supervised GAN by accommodating weakly labelled multi-class negative samples and the available positive samples. It relaxes the supervised discriminator's constraint on exact differentiation between negative samples by introducing a 'leeway' term for samples with noisy prior. We propose modifications to the cost objectives of discriminator, in supervised and unsupervised path as well as that of the generator. For identifying risky players in skill gaming, this formulation in whole gives us a recall of over 85% (~60% jump over vanilla semi-supervised GAN) on our scarce class with very minimal verbosity in the unknown space. Further ScarceGAN outperforms the recall benchmarks established by recent GAN based specialized models for the positive imbalanced class identification and establishes a new benchmark in identifying one of rare attack classes (0.09%) in the intrusion dataset from the KDDCUP99 challenge.

The paper introduces a certifiable and cost-efficient evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs). It addresses the challenges of evaluating exponentially growing models by adapting to different evaluation objectives and providing confidence intervals with high probability. The framework quantifies the test sample complexity needed for evaluation and utilizes a partition-based algorithm, Cer-Eval, to minimize evaluation costs. Real-world experiments show that Cer-Eval can save 20% to 40% of test points while maintaining estimation accuracy comparable to current methods and providing a 95% confidence guarantee. This approach fills a gap by offering systematic analysis and guidance for evaluating LLMs, ensuring sufficient test data selection for reliable assessment. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As foundation models continue to scale, the size of trained models grows exponentially, presenting significant challenges for their evaluation. Current evaluation practices involve curating increasingly large datasets to assess the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, there is a lack of systematic analysis and guidance on determining the sufficiency of test data or selecting informative samples for evaluation. This paper introduces a certifiable and cost-efficient evaluation framework for LLMs. Our framework adapts to different evaluation objectives and outputs confidence intervals that contain true values with high probability. We use ``test sample complexity'' to quantify the number of test points needed for a certifiable evaluation and derive tight bounds on test sample complexity. Based on the developed theory, we develop a partition-based algorithm, named Cer-Eval, that adaptively selects test points to minimize the cost of LLM evaluation. Real-world experiments demonstrate that Cer-Eval can save 20% to 40% test points across various benchmarks, while maintaining an estimation error level comparable to the current evaluation process and providing a 95% confidence guarantee.

Abstract: Urban transportation plays a vital role in modern city life, affecting how efficiently people and goods move around. This study analyzes transportation patterns using two datasets: the NYC Taxi Trip dataset from New York City and the Pathao Food Trip dataset from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Our goal is to identify key trends in demand, peak times, and important geographical hotspots. We start with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the basic characteristics of the datasets. Next, we perform geospatial analysis to map out high-demand and low-demand regions. We use the SARIMAX model for time series analysis to forecast demand patterns, capturing seasonal and weekly variations. Lastly, we apply clustering techniques to identify significant areas of high and low demand. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing fleet management and resource allocation in both passenger transport and food delivery services. These insights can help improve service efficiency, better meet customer needs, and enhance urban transportation systems in diverse urban environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a holistic approach to attacker preference modeling from system-level audit logs using inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Adversary modeling is an important capability in cybersecurity that lets defenders characterize behaviors of potential attackers, which enables attribution to known cyber adversary groups. Existing approaches rely on documenting an ever-evolving set of attacker tools and techniques to track known threat actors. Although attacks evolve constantly, attacker behavioral preferences are intrinsic and less volatile. Our approach learns the behavioral preferences of cyber adversaries from forensics data on their tools and techniques. We model the attacker as an expert decision-making agent with unknown behavioral preferences situated in a computer host. We leverage attack provenance graphs of audit logs to derive a state-action trajectory of the attack. We test our approach on open datasets of audit logs containing real attack data. Our results demonstrate for the first time that low-level forensics data can automatically reveal an adversary's subjective preferences, which serves as an additional dimension to modeling and documenting cyber adversaries. Attackers' preferences tend to be invariant despite their different tools and indicate predispositions that are inherent to the attacker. As such, these inferred preferences can potentially serve as unique behavioral signatures of attackers and improve threat attribution.

  In this work, we explore a method to synthetically generate code reasoning training data based on a semantic inequivalence game SInQ: a generator agent creates program variants that are semantically distinct, derived from a dataset of real-world programming tasks, while an evaluator agent has to identify input examples that cause the original programs and the generated variants to diverge in their behaviour, with the agents training each other semi-adversarially. We prove that this setup enables theoretically unlimited improvement through self-play in the limit of infinite computational resources.
  We evaluated our approach on multiple code generation and understanding benchmarks, including cross-language vulnerability detection (Lu et al., 2021), where our method improves vulnerability detection in C/C++ code despite being trained exclusively on Python code, and the challenging Python builtin identifier swap benchmark (Miceli-Barone et al., 2023), showing that whereas modern LLMs still struggle with this benchmark, our approach yields substantial improvements.
  We release the code needed to replicate the experiments, as well as the generated synthetic data, which can be used to fine-tune LLMs.

<title>Focus on the Likely: Test-time Instance-based Uncertainty Removal</title>

Abstract: We propose two novel test-time fine-tuning methods to improve uncertain model predictions. Our methods require no auxiliary data and use the given test instance only. Instead of performing a greedy selection of the most likely class to make a prediction, we introduce an additional focus on the likely classes step during inference. By applying a single-step gradient descent, we refine predictions when an initial forward pass indicates high uncertainty. This aligns predictions more closely with the ideal of assigning zero probability to less plausible outcomes. Our theoretical discussion provides a deeper understanding highlighting the impact on shared and non-shared features among (focus) classes. The experimental evaluation highlights accuracy gains on samples exhibiting high decision uncertainty for a diverse set of models from both the text and image domain using the same hyperparameters.

Abstract: We investigate the ability of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to perform visual perspective taking using a novel set of visual tasks inspired by established human tests. Our approach leverages carefully controlled scenes, in which a single humanoid minifigure is paired with a single object. By systematically varying spatial configurations - such as object position relative to the humanoid minifigure and the humanoid minifigure's orientation - and using both bird's-eye and surface-level views, we created 144 unique visual tasks. Each visual task is paired with a series of 7 diagnostic questions designed to assess three levels of visual cognition: scene understanding, spatial reasoning, and visual perspective taking. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, and variants of Claude Sonnet, reveals that while they excel in scene understanding, the performance declines significantly on spatial reasoning and further deteriorates on perspective-taking. Our analysis suggests a gap between surface-level object recognition and the deeper spatial and perspective reasoning required for complex visual tasks, pointing to the need for integrating explicit geometric representations and tailored training protocols in future VLM development.

<title>DRSLF: Double Regularized Second-Order Low-Rank Representation for Web Service QoS Prediction</title>

Abstract: Quality-of-Service (QoS) data plays a crucial role in cloud service selection. Since users cannot access all services, QoS can be represented by a high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) matrix. Latent factor analysis (LFA) models have been proven effective as low-rank representation techniques for addressing this issue. However, most LFA models rely on first-order optimizers and use L2-norm regularization, which can lead to lower QoS prediction accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a double regularized second-order latent factor (DRSLF) model with two key ideas: a) integrating L1-norm and L2-norm regularization terms to enhance the low-rank representation performance; b) incorporating second-order information by calculating the Hessian-vector product in each conjugate gradient step. Experimental results on two real-world response-time QoS datasets demonstrate that DRSLF has a higher low-rank representation capability than two baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in solving recommendation tasks. With proven capabilities in understanding user preferences, LLM personalization has emerged as a critical area for providing tailored responses to individuals. Current studies explore personalization through prompt design and fine-tuning, paving the way for further research in personalized LLMs. However, existing approaches are either costly and inefficient in capturing diverse user preferences or fail to account for timely updates to user history. To address these gaps, we propose the Memory-Assisted Personalized LLM (MAP). Through user interactions, we first create a history profile for each user, capturing their preferences, such as ratings for historical items. During recommendation, we extract relevant memory based on similarity, which is then incorporated into the prompts to enhance personalized recommendations. In our experiments, we evaluate MAP using a sequential rating prediction task under two scenarios: single domain, where memory and tasks are from the same category (e.g., movies), and cross-domain (e.g., memory from movies and recommendation tasks in books). The results show that MAP outperforms regular LLM-based recommenders that integrate user history directly through prompt design. Moreover, as user history grows, MAP's advantage increases in both scenarios, making it more suitable for addressing successive personalized user requests.

<title>Intelligently Augmented Contrastive Tensor Factorization: Empowering Multi-dimensional Time Series Classification in Low-Data Environments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03825</link>

Abstract: Classification of multi-dimensional time series from real-world systems require fine-grained learning of complex features such as cross-dimensional dependencies and intra-class variations-all under the practical challenge of low training data availability. However, standard deep learning (DL) struggles to learn generalizable features in low-data environments due to model overfitting. We propose a versatile yet data-efficient framework, Intelligently Augmented Contrastive Tensor Factorization (ITA-CTF), to learn effective representations from multi-dimensional time series. The CTF module learns core explanatory components of the time series (e.g., sensor factors, temporal factors), and importantly, their joint dependencies. Notably, unlike standard tensor factorization (TF), the CTF module incorporates a new contrastive loss optimization to induce similarity learning and class-awareness into the learnt representations for better classification performance. To strengthen this contrastive learning, the preceding ITA module generates targeted but informative augmentations that highlight realistic intra-class patterns in the original data, while preserving class-wise properties. This is achieved by dynamically sampling a "soft" class prototype to guide the warping of each query data sample, which results in an augmentation that is intelligently pattern-mixed between the "soft" class prototype and the query sample. These augmentations enable the CTF module to recognize complex intra-class variations despite the limited original training data, and seek out invariant class-wise properties for accurate classification performance. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on five different classification tasks. Compared to standard TF and several DL benchmarks, notable performance improvements up to 18.7% were achieved.

Abstract: Precise monitoring of etch depth and the thickness of insulating materials, such as Silicon dioxide and silicon nitride, is critical to ensuring device performance and yield in semiconductor manufacturing. While conventional ex-situ analysis methods are accurate, they are constrained by time delays and contamination risks. To address these limitations, this study proposes a non-contact, in-situ etch depth prediction framework based on machine learning (ML) techniques. Two scenarios are explored. In the first scenario, an artificial neural network (ANN) is trained to predict average etch depth from process parameters, achieving a significantly lower mean squared error (MSE) compared to a linear baseline model. The approach is then extended to incorporate variability from repeated measurements using a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Coverage analysis confirms the BNN's capability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates. In the second scenario, we demonstrate the feasibility of using RGB data from digital image colorimetry (DIC) as input for etch depth prediction, achieving strong performance even in the absence of explicit process parameters. These results suggest that the integration of DIC and ML offers a viable, cost-effective alternative for real-time, in-situ, and non-invasive monitoring in plasma etching processes, contributing to enhanced process stability, and manufacturing efficiency.

Abstract: Stress haunts people in modern society, which may cause severe health issues if left unattended. With social media becoming an integral part of daily life, leveraging social media to detect stress has gained increasing attention. While the majority of the work focuses on classifying stress states and stress categories, this study introduce a new task aimed at estimating more specific stressors (like exam, writing paper, etc.) through users' posts on social media. Unfortunately, the diversity of stressors with many different classes but a few examples per class, combined with the consistent arising of new stressors over time, hinders the machine understanding of stressors. To this end, we cast the stressor estimation problem within a practical scenario few-shot learning setting, and propose a novel meta-learning based stressor estimation framework that is enhanced by a meta-knowledge inheritance mechanism. This model can not only learn generic stressor context through meta-learning, but also has a good generalization ability to estimate new stressors with little labeled data. A fundamental breakthrough in our approach lies in the inclusion of the meta-knowledge inheritance mechanism, which equips our model with the ability to prevent catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new stressors. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with the baselines. Additionally, we construct a social media-based stressor estimation dataset that can help train artificial intelligence models to facilitate human well-being. The dataset is now public at \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xinwangcs/stressor-cause-of-mental-health-problem-dataset}{\underline{Kaggle}} and \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/XinWangcs/Stressor}{\underline{Hugging Face}}.

Abstract: E-commerce platforms generate vast volumes of user feedback, such as star ratings, written reviews, and comments. However, most recommendation engines rely primarily on numerical scores, often overlooking the nuanced opinions embedded in free text. This paper comprehensively reviews sentiment-aware recommendation systems from a natural language processing perspective, covering advancements from 2023 to early 2025. It highlights the benefits of integrating sentiment analysis into e-commerce recommenders to enhance prediction accuracy and explainability through detailed opinion extraction. Our survey categorizes recent work into four main approaches: deep learning classifiers that combine sentiment embeddings with user item interactions, transformer based methods for nuanced feature extraction, graph neural networks that propagate sentiment signals, and conversational recommenders that adapt in real time to user feedback. We summarize model architectures and demonstrate how sentiment flows through recommendation pipelines, impacting dialogue-based suggestions. Key challenges include handling noisy or sarcastic text, dynamic user preferences, and bias mitigation. Finally, we outline research gaps and provide a roadmap for developing smarter, fairer, and more user-centric recommendation tools.

Abstract: The widespread availability of video recording through smartphones and digital devices has made video-based evidence more accessible than ever. Surveillance footage plays a crucial role in security, law enforcement, and judicial processes. However, with the rise of advanced video editing tools, tampering with digital recordings has become increasingly easy, raising concerns about their authenticity. Ensuring the integrity of surveillance videos is essential, as manipulated footage can lead to misinformation and undermine judicial decisions. This paper provides a comprehensive review of existing forensic techniques used to detect video forgery, focusing on their effectiveness in verifying the authenticity of surveillance recordings. Various methods, including compression-based analysis, frame duplication detection, and machine learning-based approaches, are explored. The findings highlight the growing necessity for more robust forensic techniques to counteract evolving forgery methods. Strengthening video forensic capabilities will ensure that surveillance recordings remain credible and admissible as legal evidence.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have shown potential in analyzing digitized hand-drawn signals for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. However, the lack of clear interpretability in existing diagnostic methods presents a challenge to clinical trust. In this paper, we propose PointExplainer, an explainable diagnostic strategy to identify hand-drawn regions that drive model diagnosis. Specifically, PointExplainer assigns discrete attribution values to hand-drawn segments, explicitly quantifying their relative contributions to the model's decision. Its key components include: (i) a diagnosis module, which encodes hand-drawn signals into 3D point clouds to represent hand-drawn trajectories, and (ii) an explanation module, which trains an interpretable surrogate model to approximate the local behavior of the black-box diagnostic model. We also introduce consistency measures to further address the issue of faithfulness in explanations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and a newly constructed dataset show that PointExplainer can provide intuitive explanations with no diagnostic performance degradation.

Abstract: The adoption of open science has quickly changed how artificial intelligence (AI) policy research is distributed globally. This study examines the regional trends in the citation of preprints, specifically focusing on the impact of two major disruptive events: the COVID-19 pandemic and the release of ChatGPT, on research dissemination patterns in the United States, Europe, and South Korea from 2015 to 2024. Using bibliometrics data from the Web of Science, this study tracks how global disruptive events influenced the adoption of preprints in AI policy research and how such shifts vary by region. By marking the timing of these disruptive events, the analysis reveals that while all regions experienced growth in preprint citations, the magnitude and trajectory of change varied significantly. The United States exhibited sharp, event-driven increases; Europe demonstrated institutional growth; and South Korea maintained consistent, linear growth in preprint adoption. These findings suggest that global disruptions may have accelerated preprint adoption, but the extent and trajectory are shaped by local research cultures, policy environments, and levels of open science maturity. This paper emphasizes the need for future AI governance strategies to consider regional variability in research dissemination and highlights opportunities for further longitudinal and comparative research to deepen our understanding of open-access adoption in AI policy development.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscription (OBI) is the earliest systematic writing system in China, while the identification of Oracle Bone (OB) duplicates is a fundamental issue in OBI research. In this work, we design a progressive OB duplicate discovery framework that combines unsupervised low-level keypoints matching with high-level text-centric content-based matching to refine and rank the candidate OB duplicates with semantic awareness and interpretability. We compare our approach with state-of-the-art content-based image retrieval and image matching methods, showing that our approach yields comparable recall performance and the highest simplified mean reciprocal rank scores for both Top-5 and Top-15 retrieval results, and with significantly accelerated computation efficiency. We have discovered over 60 pairs of new OB duplicates in real-world deployment, which were missed by OBI researchers for decades.

Abstract: Biometric authentication has become one of the most widely used tools in the current technological era to authenticate users and to distinguish between genuine users and imposters. Face is the most common form of biometric modality that has proven effective. Deep learning-based face recognition systems are now commonly used across different domains. However, these systems usually operate like black-box models that do not provide necessary explanations or justifications for their decisions. This is a major disadvantage because users cannot trust such artificial intelligence-based biometric systems and may not feel comfortable using them when clear explanations or justifications are not provided. This paper addresses this problem by applying an efficient method for explainable face recognition systems. We use a Class Activation Mapping (CAM)-based discriminative localization (very narrow/specific localization) technique called Scaled Directed Divergence (SDD) to visually explain the results of deep learning-based face recognition systems. We perform fine localization of the face features relevant to the deep learning model for its prediction/decision. Our experiments show that the SDD Class Activation Map (CAM) highlights the relevant face features very specifically compared to the traditional CAM and very accurately. The provided visual explanations with narrow localization of relevant features can ensure much-needed transparency and trust for deep learning-based face recognition systems.

Abstract: Precise and effective processing of cardiac imaging data is critical for the identification and management of the cardiovascular diseases. We introduce IntelliCardiac, a comprehensive, web-based medical image processing platform for the automatic segmentation of 4D cardiac images and disease classification, utilizing an AI model trained on the publicly accessible ACDC dataset. The system, intended for patients, cardiologists, and healthcare professionals, offers an intuitive interface and uses deep learning models to identify essential heart structures and categorize cardiac diseases. The system supports analysis of both the right and left ventricles as well as myocardium, and then classifies patient's cardiac images into five diagnostic categories: dilated cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, right ventricular abnormality, and no disease. IntelliCardiac combines a deep learning-based segmentation model with a two-step classification pipeline. The segmentation module gains an overall accuracy of 92.6\%. The classification module, trained on characteristics taken from segmented heart structures, achieves 98\% accuracy in five categories. These results exceed the performance of the existing state-of-the-art methods that integrate both segmentation and classification models. IntelliCardiac, which supports real-time visualization, workflow integration, and AI-assisted diagnostics, has great potential as a scalable, accurate tool for clinical decision assistance in cardiac imaging and diagnosis.

Abstract: Clustering bandits have gained significant attention in recommender systems by leveraging collaborative information from neighboring users to better capture target user preferences. However, these methods often lack a clear definition of similar users and face challenges when users with unique preferences lack appropriate neighbors. In such cases, relying on divergent preferences of misidentified neighbors can degrade recommendation quality. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive Collaborative Combinatorial Bandits algorithm (CoCoB). CoCoB employs an innovative two-sided bandit architecture, applying bandit principles to both the user and item sides. The user-bandit employs an enhanced Bayesian model to explore user similarity, identifying neighbors based on a similarity probability threshold. The item-bandit treats items as arms, generating diverse recommendations informed by the user-bandit's output. CoCoB dynamically adapts, leveraging neighbor preferences when available or focusing solely on the target user otherwise. Regret analysis under a linear contextual bandit setting and experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate CoCoB's effectiveness, achieving an average 2.4% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The availability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery has increased considerably in recent years, with datasets commercially available. However, the acquisition of high-resolution SAR images in airborne configurations, remains costly and limited. Thus, the lack of open source, well-labeled, or easily exploitable SAR text-image datasets is a barrier to the use of existing foundation models in remote sensing applications. In this context, synthetic image generation is a promising solution to augment this scarce data, enabling a broader range of applications. Leveraging over 15 years of ONERA's extensive archival airborn data from acquisition campaigns, we created a comprehensive training dataset of 110 thousands SAR images to exploit a 3.5 billion parameters pre-trained latent diffusion model. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing spatial conditioning techniques within a foundation model to transform satellite SAR imagery into airborne SAR representations. Additionally, we demonstrate that our pipeline is effective for bridging the realism of simulated images generated by ONERA's physics-based simulator EMPRISE. Our method explores a key application of AI in advancing SAR imaging technology. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce this approach in the literature.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, manifesting with motor and non-motor symptoms. Depressive symptoms are prevalent in PD, affecting up to 45% of patients. They are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping motor features, such as hypomimia. This study explores deep learning (DL) models-ViViT, Video Swin Tiny, and 3D CNN-LSTM with attention layers-to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms, as detected by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), in PD patients through facial video analysis. The same parameters were assessed in a secondary analysis taking into account whether patients were one hour after (ON-medication state) or 12 hours without (OFF-medication state) dopaminergic medication. Using a dataset of 1,875 videos from 178 patients, the Video Swin Tiny model achieved the highest performance, with up to 94% accuracy and 93.7% F1-score in binary classification (presence of absence of depressive symptoms), and 87.1% accuracy with an 85.4% F1-score in multiclass tasks (absence or mild or severe depressive symptoms).

Abstract: Apparent personality analysis from short videos poses significant chal-lenges due to the complex interplay of visual, auditory, and textual cues. In this paper, we propose GAME, a Graph-Augmented Multimodal Encoder designed to robustly model and fuse multi-source features for automatic personality prediction. For the visual stream, we construct a facial graph and introduce a dual-branch Geo Two-Stream Network, which combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Convolutional Neural Net-works (CNNs) with attention mechanisms to capture both structural and appearance-based facial cues. Complementing this, global context and iden-tity features are extracted using pretrained ResNet18 and VGGFace back-bones. To capture temporal dynamics, frame-level features are processed by a BiGRU enhanced with temporal attention modules. Meanwhile, audio representations are derived from the VGGish network, and linguistic se-mantics are captured via the XLM-Roberta transformer. To achieve effective multimodal integration, we propose a Channel Attention-based Fusion module, followed by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regression head for predicting personality traits. Extensive experiments show that GAME con-sistently outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks, vali-dating its effectiveness and generalizability.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing generates vast amounts of image data, crucial for defect identification and yield optimization, yet often exceeds manual inspection capabilities. Traditional clustering techniques struggle with high-dimensional, unlabeled data, limiting their effectiveness in capturing nuanced patterns. This paper introduces an advanced clustering framework that integrates deep Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with self-supervised and transfer learning techniques, offering a novel approach to unsupervised image clustering. TDA captures intrinsic topological features, while self-supervised learning extracts meaningful representations from unlabeled data, reducing reliance on labeled datasets. Transfer learning enhances the framework's adaptability and scalability, allowing fine-tuning to new datasets without retraining from scratch. Validated on synthetic and open-source semiconductor image datasets, the framework successfully identifies clusters aligned with defect patterns and process variations. This study highlights the transformative potential of combining TDA, self-supervised learning, and transfer learning, providing a scalable solution for proactive process monitoring and quality control in semiconductor manufacturing and other domains with large-scale image datasets.

Abstract: As a safety-critical cyber-physical system, cybersecurity and related safety issues for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have been important research topics for a while. Among all the modules on AVs, perception is one of the most accessible attack surfaces, as drivers and AVs have no control over the outside environment. Most current work targeting perception security for AVs focuses on perception correctness. In this work, we propose an impact analysis based on inference time attacks for autonomous vehicles. We demonstrate in a simulation system that such inference time attacks can also threaten the safety of both the ego vehicle and other traffic participants.

Abstract: Predicting genetic perturbations enables the identification of potentially crucial genes prior to wet-lab experiments, significantly improving overall experimental efficiency. Since genes are the foundation of cellular life, building gene regulatory networks (GRN) is essential to understand and predict the effects of genetic perturbations. However, current methods fail to fully leverage gene-related information, and solely rely on simple evaluation metrics to construct coarse-grained GRN. More importantly, they ignore functional differences between biotypes, limiting the ability to capture potential gene interactions. In this work, we leverage pre-trained large language model and DNA sequence model to extract features from gene descriptions and DNA sequence data, respectively, which serve as the initialization for gene representations. Additionally, we introduce gene biotype information for the first time in genetic perturbation, simulating the distinct roles of genes with different biotypes in regulating cellular processes, while capturing implicit gene relationships through graph structure learning (GSL). We propose GRAPE, a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) that leverages gene representations initialized with features from descriptions and sequences, models the distinct roles of genes with different biotypes, and dynamically refines the GRN through GSL. The results on publicly available datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The ability to selectively attend to relevant stimuli while filtering out distractions is essential for agents that process complex, high-dimensional sensory input. This paper introduces a model of covert and overt visual attention through the framework of active inference, utilizing dynamic optimization of sensory precisions to minimize free-energy. The model determines visual sensory precisions based on both current environmental beliefs and sensory input, influencing attentional allocation in both covert and overt modalities. To test the effectiveness of the model, we analyze its behavior in the Posner cueing task and a simple target focus task using two-dimensional(2D) visual data. Reaction times are measured to investigate the interplay between exogenous and endogenous attention, as well as valid and invalid cueing. The results show that exogenous and valid cues generally lead to faster reaction times compared to endogenous and invalid cues. Furthermore, the model exhibits behavior similar to inhibition of return, where previously attended locations become suppressed after a specific cue-target onset asynchrony interval. Lastly, we investigate different aspects of overt attention and show that involuntary, reflexive saccades occur faster than intentional ones, but at the expense of adaptability.

Abstract: Advances in multimodal machine learning have made text-to-image (T2I) models increasingly accessible and popular. However, T2I models introduce risks such as the generation of non-consensual depictions of identifiable individuals, otherwise known as deepfakes. This paper presents an empirical study exploring the accessibility of deepfake model variants online. Through a metadata analysis of thousands of publicly downloadable model variants on two popular repositories, Hugging Face and Civitai, we demonstrate a huge rise in easily accessible deepfake models. Almost 35,000 examples of publicly downloadable deepfake model variants are identified, primarily hosted on Civitai. These deepfake models have been downloaded almost 15 million times since November 2022, with the models targeting a range of individuals from global celebrities to Instagram users with under 10,000 followers. Both Stable Diffusion and Flux models are used for the creation of deepfake models, with 96% of these targeting women and many signalling intent to generate non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII). Deepfake model variants are often created via the parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique known as low rank adaptation (LoRA), requiring as few as 20 images, 24GB VRAM, and 15 minutes of time, making this process widely accessible via consumer-grade computers. Despite these models violating the Terms of Service of hosting platforms, and regulation seeking to prevent dissemination, these results emphasise the pressing need for greater action to be taken against the creation of deepfakes and NCII.

<title>Data-Driven Falsification of Cyber-Physical Systems</title>

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are abundant in safety-critical domains such as healthcare, avionics, and autonomous vehicles. Formal verification of their operational safety is, therefore, of utmost importance. In this paper, we address the falsification problem, where the focus is on searching for an unsafe execution in the system instead of proving their absence. The contribution of this paper is a framework that (a) connects the falsification of CPS with the falsification of deep neural networks (DNNs) and (b) leverages the inherent interpretability of Decision Trees for faster falsification of CPS. This is achieved by: (1) building a surrogate model of the CPS under test, either as a DNN model or a Decision Tree, (2) application of various DNN falsification tools to falsify CPS, and (3) a novel falsification algorithm guided by the explanations of safety violations of the CPS model extracted from its Decision Tree surrogate. The proposed framework has the potential to exploit a repertoire of \emph{adversarial attack} algorithms designed to falsify robustness properties of DNNs, as well as state-of-the-art falsification algorithms for DNNs. Although the presented methodology is applicable to systems that can be executed/simulated in general, we demonstrate its effectiveness, particularly in CPS. We show that our framework, implemented as a tool \textsc{FlexiFal}, can detect hard-to-find counterexamples in CPS that have linear and non-linear dynamics. Decision tree-guided falsification shows promising results in efficiently finding multiple counterexamples in the ARCH-COMP 2024 falsification benchmarks~\cite{khandait2024arch}.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving towards multi-agent systems where numerous AI agents collaborate and interact with external tools. Two key open standards, Google's Agent to Agent (A2A) protocol for inter-agent communication and Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized tool access, promise to overcome the limitations of fragmented, custom integration approaches. While their potential synergy is significant, this paper argues that effectively integrating A2A and MCP presents unique, emergent challenges at their intersection, particularly concerning semantic interoperability between agent tasks and tool capabilities, the compounded security risks arising from combined discovery and execution, and the practical governance required for the envisioned "Agent Economy". This work provides a critical analysis, moving beyond a survey to evaluate the practical implications and inherent difficulties of combining these horizontal and vertical integration standards. We examine the benefits (e.g., specialization, scalability) while critically assessing their dependencies and trade-offs in an integrated context. We identify key challenges increased by the integration, including novel security vulnerabilities, privacy complexities, debugging difficulties across protocols, and the need for robust semantic negotiation mechanisms. In summary, A2A+MCP offers a vital architectural foundation, but fully realizing its potential requires substantial advancements to manage the complexities of their combined operation.

Abstract: Creative coding platforms like Scratch have democratized programming for children, yet translating imaginative ideas into functional code remains a significant hurdle for many young learners. While AI copilots assist adult programmers, few tools target children in block-based environments. Building on prior research \cite{druga_how_2021,druga2023ai, druga2023scratch}, we present Cognimates Scratch Copilot: an AI-powered assistant integrated into a Scratch-like environment, providing real-time support for ideation, code generation, debugging, and asset creation. This paper details the system architecture and findings from an exploratory qualitative evaluation with 18 international children (ages 7--12). Our analysis reveals how the AI Copilot supported key creative coding processes, particularly aiding ideation and debugging. Crucially, it also highlights how children actively negotiated the use of AI, demonstrating strong agency by adapting or rejecting suggestions to maintain creative control. Interactions surfaced design tensions between providing helpful scaffolding and fostering independent problem-solving, as well as learning opportunities arising from navigating AI limitations and errors. Findings indicate Cognimates Scratch Copilot's potential to enhance creative self-efficacy and engagement. Based on these insights, we propose initial design guidelines for AI coding assistants that prioritize youth agency and critical interaction alongside supportive scaffolding.

<title>Novel Extraction of Discriminative Fine-Grained Feature to Improve Retinal Vessel Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is a vital early detection method for several severe ocular diseases. Despite significant progress in retinal vessel segmentation with the advancement of Neural Networks, there are still challenges to overcome. Specifically, retinal vessel segmentation aims to predict the class label for every pixel within a fundus image, with a primary focus on intra-image discrimination, making it vital for models to extract more discriminative features. Nevertheless, existing methods primarily focus on minimizing the difference between the output from the decoder and the label, but ignore fully using feature-level fine-grained representations from the encoder. To address these issues, we propose a novel Attention U-shaped Kolmogorov-Arnold Network named AttUKAN along with a novel Label-guided Pixel-wise Contrastive Loss for retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we implement Attention Gates into Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to enhance model sensitivity by suppressing irrelevant feature activations and model interpretability by non-linear modeling of KAN blocks. Additionally, we also design a novel Label-guided Pixel-wise Contrastive Loss to supervise our proposed AttUKAN to extract more discriminative features by distinguishing between foreground vessel-pixel pairs and background pairs. Experiments are conducted across four public datasets including DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1, HRF and our private dataset. AttUKAN achieves F1 scores of 82.50%, 81.14%, 81.34%, 80.21% and 80.09%, along with MIoU scores of 70.24%, 68.64%, 68.59%, 67.21% and 66.94% in the above datasets, which are the highest compared to 11 networks for retinal vessel segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our AttUKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing retinal vessel segmentation methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/stevezs315/AttUKAN.

Abstract: Optimization problems with norm-bounding constraints arise in a variety of applications, including portfolio optimization, machine learning, and feature selection. A common approach to these problems involves relaxing the norm constraint via Lagrangian relaxation, transforming it into a regularization term in the objective function. A particularly challenging class includes the zero-norm function, which promotes sparsity in statistical parameter estimation. Most existing exact methods for solving these problems introduce binary variables and artificial bounds to reformulate them as higher-dimensional mixed-integer programs, solvable by standard solvers. Other exact approaches exploit specific structural properties of the objective, making them difficult to generalize across different problem types. Alternative methods employ nonconvex penalties with favorable statistical characteristics, but these are typically addressed using heuristic or local optimization techniques due to their structural complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based method to globally solve optimization problems involving generalized norm-bounding constraints. Our approach encompasses standard $\ell_p$-norms for $p \in [0, \infty)$ and nonconvex penalties such as SCAD and MCP. We leverage decision diagrams to construct strong convex relaxations directly in the original variable space, eliminating the need for auxiliary variables or artificial bounds. Integrated into a spatial branch-and-cut framework, our method guarantees convergence to the global optimum. We demonstrate its effectiveness through preliminary computational experiments on benchmark sparse linear regression problems involving complex nonconvex penalties, which are not tractable using existing global optimization techniques.

Abstract: Cloud security concerns have been greatly realized in recent years due to the increase of complicated threats in the computing world. Many traditional solutions do not work well in real-time to detect or prevent more complex threats. Artificial intelligence is today regarded as a revolution in determining a protection plan for cloud data architecture through machine learning, statistical visualization of computing infrastructure, and detection of security breaches followed by counteraction. These AI-enabled systems make work easier as more network activities are scrutinized, and any anomalous behavior that might be a precursor to a more serious breach is prevented. This paper examines ways AI can enhance cloud security by applying predictive analytics, behavior-based security threat detection, and AI-stirring encryption. It also outlines the problems of the previous security models and how AI overcomes them. For a similar reason, issues like data privacy, biases in the AI model, and regulatory compliance are also covered. So, AI improves the protection of cloud computing contexts; however, more efforts are needed in the subsequent phases to extend the technology's reliability, modularity, and ethical aspects. This means that AI can be blended with other new computing technologies, including blockchain, to improve security frameworks further. The paper discusses the current trends in securing cloud data architecture using AI and presents further research and application directions.

Abstract: Resource allocation in High Performance Computing (HPC) environments presents a complex and multifaceted challenge for job scheduling algorithms. Beyond the efficient allocation of system resources, schedulers must account for and optimize multiple performance metrics, including job wait time and system utilization. While traditional rule-based scheduling algorithms dominate the current deployments of HPC systems, the increasing heterogeneity and scale of those systems is expected to challenge the efficiency and flexibility of those algorithms in minimizing job wait time and maximizing utilization. Recent research efforts have focused on leveraging advancements in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to develop more adaptable and intelligent scheduling strategies. Recent RL-based scheduling approaches have explored a range of algorithms, from Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and more recently, hybrid methods that integrate Graph Neural Networks with RL techniques. However, a common limitation across these methods is their reliance on relatively small datasets, and these methods face scalability issues when using large datasets. This study introduces a novel RL-based scheduler utilizing the Decentralized Distributed Proximal Policy Optimization (DD-PPO) algorithm, which supports large-scale distributed training across multiple workers without requiring parameter synchronization at every step. By eliminating reliance on centralized updates to a shared policy, the DD-PPO scheduler enhances scalability, training efficiency, and sample utilization. The validation dataset leveraged over 11.5 million real HPC job traces for comparing DD-PPO performance between traditional and advanced scheduling approaches, and the experimental results demonstrate improved scheduling performance in comparison to both rule-based schedulers and existing RL-based scheduling algorithms.

Abstract: Recently, there has been an impetus for the application of cutting-edge data collection platforms such as drones mounted with camera sensors for infrastructure asset management. However, the sensor characteristics, proximity to the structure, hard-to-reach access, and environmental conditions often limit the resolution of the datasets. A few studies used super-resolution techniques to address the problem of low-resolution images. Nevertheless, these techniques were observed to increase computational cost and false alarms of distress detection due to the consideration of all the infrastructure images i.e., positive and negative distress classes. In order to address the pre-processing of false alarm and achieve efficient super-resolution, this study developed a framework consisting of convolutional neural network (CNN) and efficient sub-pixel convolutional neural network (ESPCNN). CNN accurately classified both the classes. ESPCNN, which is the lightweight super-resolution technique, generated high-resolution infrastructure image of positive distress obtained from CNN. The ESPCNN outperformed bicubic interpolation in all the evaluation metrics for super-resolution. Based on the performance metrics, the combination of CNN and ESPCNN was observed to be effective in preprocessing the infrastructure images with negative distress, reducing the computational cost and false alarms in the next step of super-resolution. The visual inspection showed that EPSCNN is able to capture crack propagation, complex geometry of even minor cracks. The proposed framework is expected to help the highway agencies in accurately performing distress detection and assist in efficient asset management practices.

Abstract: Recent proprietary models (e.g., o3) have begun to demonstrate strong multimodal reasoning capabilities. Yet, most existing open-source research concentrates on training text-only reasoning models, with evaluations limited to mainly mathematical and general-domain tasks. Therefore, it remains unclear how to effectively extend reasoning capabilities beyond text input and general domains. This paper explores a fundamental research question: Is reasoning generalizable across modalities and domains? Our findings support an affirmative answer: General-domain text-based post-training can enable such strong generalizable reasoning. Leveraging this finding, we introduce X-Reasoner, a vision-language model post-trained solely on general-domain text for generalizable reasoning, using a two-stage approach: an initial supervised fine-tuning phase with distilled long chain-of-thoughts, followed by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Experiments show that X-Reasoner successfully transfers reasoning capabilities to both multimodal and out-of-domain settings, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models trained with in-domain and multimodal data across various general and medical benchmarks (Figure 1). Additionally, we find that X-Reasoner's performance in specialized domains can be further enhanced through continued training on domain-specific text-only data. Building upon this, we introduce X-Reasoner-Med, a medical-specialized variant that achieves new state of the art on numerous text-only and multimodal medical benchmarks.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generative modeling. However, their sequential computation requirements lead to significant inference-time bottlenecks. In this work, we utilize the connection between DDPMs and Stochastic Localization to prove that, under an appropriate reparametrization, the increments of DDPM satisfy an exchangeability property. This general insight enables near-black-box adaptation of various performance optimization techniques from autoregressive models to the diffusion setting. To demonstrate this, we introduce \emph{Autospeculative Decoding} (ASD), an extension of the widely used speculative decoding algorithm to DDPMs that does not require any auxiliary draft models. Our theoretical analysis shows that ASD achieves a $\tilde{O} (K^{\frac{1}{3}})$ parallel runtime speedup over the $K$ step sequential DDPM. We also demonstrate that a practical implementation of autospeculative decoding accelerates DDPM inference significantly in various domains.

Abstract: Accurate determination of the performance of parallel GPU code typically requires execution-time profiling on target hardware -- an increasingly prohibitive step due to limited access to high-end GPUs. This paper explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can offer an alternative approach for GPU performance prediction without relying on hardware. We frame the problem as a roofline classification task: given the source code of a GPU kernel and the hardware specifications of a target GPU, can an LLM predict whether the GPU kernel is compute-bound or bandwidth-bound?
  For this study, we build a balanced dataset of 340 GPU kernels, obtained from HeCBench benchmark and written in CUDA and OpenMP, along with their ground-truth labels obtained via empirical GPU profiling. We evaluate LLMs across four scenarios: (1) with access to profiling data of the kernel source, (2) zero-shot with source code only, (3) few-shot with code and label pairs, and (4) fine-tuned on a small custom dataset.
  Our results show that state-of-the-art LLMs have a strong understanding of the Roofline model, achieving 100% classification accuracy when provided with explicit profiling data. We also find that reasoning-capable LLMs significantly outperform standard LLMs in zero- and few-shot settings, achieving up to 64% accuracy on GPU source codes, without profiling information. Lastly, we find that LLM fine-tuning will require much more data than what we currently have available.
  This work is among the first to use LLMs for source-level roofline performance prediction via classification, and illustrates their potential to guide optimization efforts when runtime profiling is infeasible. Our findings suggest that with better datasets and prompt strategies, LLMs could become practical tools for HPC performance analysis and performance portability.

Abstract: Humans excel in navigating diverse, complex environments with agile motor skills, exemplified by parkour practitioners performing dynamic maneuvers, such as climbing up walls and jumping across gaps. Reproducing these agile movements with simulated characters remains challenging, in part due to the scarcity of motion capture data for agile terrain traversal behaviors and the high cost of acquiring such data. In this work, we introduce PARC (Physics-based Augmentation with Reinforcement Learning for Character Controllers), a framework that leverages machine learning and physics-based simulation to iteratively augment motion datasets and expand the capabilities of terrain traversal controllers. PARC begins by training a motion generator on a small dataset consisting of core terrain traversal skills. The motion generator is then used to produce synthetic data for traversing new terrains. However, these generated motions often exhibit artifacts, such as incorrect contacts or discontinuities. To correct these artifacts, we train a physics-based tracking controller to imitate the motions in simulation. The corrected motions are then added to the dataset, which is used to continue training the motion generator in the next iteration. PARC's iterative process jointly expands the capabilities of the motion generator and tracker, creating agile and versatile models for interacting with complex environments. PARC provides an effective approach to develop controllers for agile terrain traversal, which bridges the gap between the scarcity of motion data and the need for versatile character controllers.

Abstract: This paper proposes MergeGuard, a novel methodology for mitigation of AI Trojan attacks. Trojan attacks on AI models cause inputs embedded with triggers to be misclassified to an adversary's target class, posing a significant threat to model usability trained by an untrusted third party. The core of MergeGuard is a new post-training methodology for linearizing and merging fully connected layers which we show simultaneously improves model generalizability and performance. Our Proof of Concept evaluation on Transformer models demonstrates that MergeGuard maintains model accuracy while decreasing trojan attack success rate, outperforming commonly used (post-training) Trojan mitigation by fine-tuning methodologies.

Abstract: Structured outputs are essential for large language models (LLMs) in critical applications like agents and information extraction. Despite their capabilities, LLMs often generate outputs that deviate from predefined schemas, significantly hampering reliable application development. We present SLOT (Structured LLM Output Transformer), a model-agnostic approach that transforms unstructured LLM outputs into precise structured formats. While existing solutions predominantly rely on constrained decoding techniques or are tightly coupled with specific models, SLOT employs a fine-tuned lightweight language model as a post-processing layer, achieving flexibility across various LLMs and schema specifications. We introduce a systematic pipeline for data curation and synthesis alongside a formal evaluation methodology that quantifies both schema accuracy and content fidelity. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned Mistral-7B model with constrained decoding achieves near perfect schema accuracy (99.5%) and content similarity (94.0%), outperforming Claude-3.5-Sonnet by substantial margins (+25 and +20 percentage points, respectively). Notably, even compact models like Llama-3.2-1B can match or exceed the structured output capabilities of much larger proprietary models when equipped with SLOT, enabling reliable structured generation in resource-constrained environments.

<title>Prism: Unleashing GPU Sharing for Cost-Efficient Multi-LLM Serving</title>

Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) is expensive, especially for providers hosting many models, making cost reduction essential. The unique workload patterns of serving multiple LLMs (i.e., multi-LLM serving) create new opportunities and challenges for this task. The long-tail popularity of models and their long idle periods present opportunities to improve utilization through GPU sharing. However, existing GPU sharing systems lack the ability to adjust their resource allocation and sharing policies at runtime, making them ineffective at meeting latency service-level objectives (SLOs) under rapidly fluctuating workloads.
  This paper presents Prism, a multi-LLM serving system that unleashes the full potential of GPU sharing to achieve both cost efficiency and SLO attainment. At its core, Prism tackles a key limitation of existing systems$\unicode{x2014}$the lack of $\textit{cross-model memory coordination}$, which is essential for flexibly sharing GPU memory across models under dynamic workloads. Prism achieves this with two key designs. First, it supports on-demand memory allocation by dynamically mapping physical to virtual memory pages, allowing flexible memory redistribution among models that space- and time-share a GPU. Second, it improves memory efficiency through a two-level scheduling policy that dynamically adjusts sharing strategies based on models' runtime demands. Evaluations on real-world traces show that Prism achieves more than $2\times$ cost savings and $3.3\times$ SLO attainment compared to state-of-the-art systems.

<title>Izhikevich-Inspired Temporal Dynamics for Enhancing Privacy, Efficiency, and Transferability in Spiking Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Biological neurons exhibit diverse temporal spike patterns, which are believed to support efficient, robust, and adaptive neural information processing. While models such as Izhikevich can replicate a wide range of these firing dynamics, their complexity poses challenges for directly integrating them into scalable spiking neural networks (SNN) training pipelines. In this work, we propose two probabilistically driven, input-level temporal spike transformations: Poisson-Burst and Delayed-Burst that introduce biologically inspired temporal variability directly into standard Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons. This enables scalable training and systematic evaluation of how spike timing dynamics affect privacy, generalization, and learning performance. Poisson-Burst modulates burst occurrence based on input intensity, while Delayed-Burst encodes input strength through burst onset timing. Through extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that Poisson-Burst maintains competitive accuracy and lower resource overhead while exhibiting enhanced privacy robustness against membership inference attacks, whereas Delayed-Burst provides stronger privacy protection at a modest accuracy trade-off. These findings highlight the potential of biologically grounded temporal spike dynamics in improving the privacy, generalization and biological plausibility of neuromorphic learning systems.

<title>Advancing and Benchmarking Personalized Tool Invocation for LLMs</title>

Abstract: Tool invocation is a crucial mechanism for extending the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and has recently garnered significant attention. It enables LLMs to solve complex problems through tool calls while accessing up-to-date world knowledge. However, existing work primarily focuses on the fundamental ability of LLMs to invoke tools for problem-solving, without considering personalized constraints in tool invocation. In this work, we introduce the concept of Personalized Tool Invocation and define two key tasks: Tool Preference and Profile-dependent Query. Tool Preference addresses user preferences when selecting among functionally similar tools, while Profile-dependent Query considers cases where a user query lacks certain tool parameters, requiring the model to infer them from the user profile. To tackle these challenges, we propose PTool, a data synthesis framework designed for personalized tool invocation. Additionally, we construct \textbf{PTBench}, the first benchmark for evaluating personalized tool invocation. We then fine-tune various open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework and providing valuable insights. Our benchmark is public at https://github.com/hyfshadow/PTBench.

<title>LLM-e Guess: Can LLMs Capabilities Advance Without Hardware Progress?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04075</link>

Abstract: This paper examines whether large language model (LLM) capabilities can continue to advance without additional compute by analyzing the development and role of algorithms used in state-of-the-art LLMs. Motivated by regulatory efforts that have largely focused on restricting access to high-performance hardware, we ask: Can LLMs progress in a compute-constrained environment, and how do algorithmic innovations perform under such conditions?
  To address these questions, we introduce a novel classification framework that distinguishes between compute-dependent innovations -- which yield disproportionate benefits at high compute levels (e.g., the Transformer architecture and mixture-of-experts models) and compute-independent innovations, which improve efficiency across all compute scales (e.g., rotary positional encoding, FlashAttention, or layer normalization). We quantify these contributions using a metric called compute-equivalent gain (CEG), which estimates the additional compute that would be required to achieve similar improvements without these algorithmic advancements.
  To validate this framework, we conduct small-scale training experiments with a scaled-down GPT-2 model. Our results confirm that compute-independent advancements yield meaningful performance gains even in resource-constrained settings, with a CEG of up to $3.5\times$ over a baseline model. By contrast, compute-dependent advancements provided little benefit or even degraded performance at the small scale, reinforcing the importance of compute availability for certain algorithmic gains.

<title>Plexus: Taming Billion-edge Graphs with 3D Parallel GNN Training</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04083</link>

Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a potent class of neural networks capable of leveraging the connectivity and structure of real-world graphs to learn intricate properties and relationships between nodes. Many real-world graphs exceed the memory capacity of a GPU due to their sheer size, and using GNNs on them requires techniques such as mini-batch sampling to scale. However, this can lead to reduced accuracy in some cases, and sampling and data transfer from the CPU to the GPU can also slow down training. On the other hand, distributed full-graph training suffers from high communication overhead and load imbalance due to the irregular structure of graphs. We propose Plexus, a three-dimensional (3D) parallel approach for full-graph training that tackles these issues and scales to billion-edge graphs. Additionally, we introduce optimizations such as a permutation scheme for load balancing, and a performance model to predict the optimal 3D configuration. We evaluate Plexus on several graph datasets and show scaling results for up to 2048 GPUs on Perlmutter, which is 33% of the machine, and 2048 GCDs on Frontier. Plexus achieves unprecedented speedups of 2.3x-12.5x over existing methods and a reduction in the time to solution by 5.2-8.7x on Perlmutter and 7-54.2x on Frontier.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), represented by OpenAI's GPT series, has significantly impacted various domains such as natural language processing, software development, education, healthcare, finance, and scientific research. However, OpenAI APIs introduce unique challenges that differ from traditional APIs, such as the complexities of prompt engineering, token-based cost management, non-deterministic outputs, and operation as black boxes. To the best of our knowledge, the challenges developers encounter when using OpenAI APIs have not been explored in previous empirical studies. To fill this gap, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study by analyzing 2,874 OpenAI API-related discussions from the popular Q&amp;A forum Stack Overflow. We first examine the popularity and difficulty of these posts. After manually categorizing them into nine OpenAI API-related categories, we identify specific challenges associated with each category through topic modeling analysis. Based on our empirical findings, we finally propose actionable implications for developers, LLM vendors, and researchers.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to be an integral part of next-generation AI-native 6G networks. With the prevalence of AI, researchers have identified numerous use cases of AI in network security. However, there are almost nonexistent studies that analyze the suitability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in network security. To fill this gap, we examine the suitability of LLMs in network security, particularly with the case study of STRIDE threat modeling. We utilize four prompting techniques with five LLMs to perform STRIDE classification of 5G threats. From our evaluation results, we point out key findings and detailed insights along with the explanation of the possible underlying factors influencing the behavior of LLMs in the modeling of certain threats. The numerical results and the insights support the necessity for adjusting and fine-tuning LLMs for network security use cases.

<title>Bringing legal knowledge to the public by constructing a legal question bank using large-scale pre-trained language model</title>

Abstract: Access to legal information is fundamental to access to justice. Yet accessibility refers not only to making legal documents available to the public, but also rendering legal information comprehensible to them. A vexing problem in bringing legal information to the public is how to turn formal legal documents such as legislation and judgments, which are often highly technical, to easily navigable and comprehensible knowledge to those without legal education. In this study, we formulate a three-step approach for bringing legal knowledge to laypersons, tackling the issues of navigability and comprehensibility. First, we translate selected sections of the law into snippets (called CLIC-pages), each being a small piece of article that focuses on explaining certain technical legal concept in layperson's terms. Second, we construct a Legal Question Bank (LQB), which is a collection of legal questions whose answers can be found in the CLIC-pages. Third, we design an interactive CLIC Recommender (CRec). Given a user's verbal description of a legal situation that requires a legal solution, CRec interprets the user's input and shortlists questions from the question bank that are most likely relevant to the given legal situation and recommends their corresponding CLIC pages where relevant legal knowledge can be found. In this paper we focus on the technical aspects of creating an LQB. We show how large-scale pre-trained language models, such as GPT-3, can be used to generate legal questions. We compare machine-generated questions (MGQs) against human-composed questions (HCQs) and find that MGQs are more scalable, cost-effective, and more diversified, while HCQs are more precise. We also show a prototype of CRec and illustrate through an example how our 3-step approach effectively brings relevant legal knowledge to the public.

Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly and produce outstanding results in image generation tasks, yet their content safety checks remain vulnerable to prompt-based jailbreaks. Through preliminary testing on platforms such as ChatGPT, MetaAI, and Grok, we observed that even short, natural prompts could lead to the generation of compromising images ranging from realistic depictions of forged documents to manipulated images of public figures.
  We introduce Unmasking the Canvas (UTC Benchmark; UTCB), a dynamic and scalable benchmark dataset to evaluate LLM vulnerability in image generation. Our methodology combines structured prompt engineering, multilingual obfuscation (e.g., Zulu, Gaelic, Base64), and evaluation using Groq-hosted LLaMA-3. The pipeline supports both zero-shot and fallback prompting strategies, risk scoring, and automated tagging. All generations are stored with rich metadata and curated into Bronze (non-verified), Silver (LLM-aided verification), and Gold (manually verified) tiers. UTCB is designed to evolve over time with new data sources, prompt templates, and model behaviors.
  Warning: This paper includes visual examples of adversarial inputs designed to test model safety. All outputs have been redacted to ensure responsible disclosure.

Abstract: "Read the room" is a significant social reasoning capability in human daily life. Humans can infer others' mental states from subtle social cues. Previous social reasoning tasks and datasets lack complexity (e.g., simple scenes, basic interactions, incomplete mental state variables, single-step reasoning, etc.) and fall far short of the challenges present in real-life social interactions. In this paper, we contribute a valuable, high-quality, and comprehensive video dataset named R^3-VQA with precise and fine-grained annotations of social events and mental states (i.e., belief, intent, desire, and emotion) as well as corresponding social causal chains in complex social scenarios. Moreover, we include human-annotated and model-generated QAs. Our task R^3-VQA includes three aspects: Social Event Understanding, Mental State Estimation, and Social Causal Reasoning. As a benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate the social reasoning capabilities and consistencies of current state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs). Comprehensive experiments show that (i) LVLMs are still far from human-level consistent social reasoning in complex social scenarios; (ii) Theory of Mind (ToM) prompting can help LVLMs perform better on social reasoning tasks. We provide some of our dataset and codes in supplementary material and will release our full dataset and codes upon acceptance.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly recognized for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, positioning them as strong alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in neuromorphic computing applications. SNNs inherently process temporal information by leveraging the precise timing of spikes, but balancing temporal feature utilization with low energy consumption remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce Temporal Shift module for Spiking Neural Networks (TS-SNN), which incorporates a novel Temporal Shift (TS) module to integrate past, present, and future spike features within a single timestep via a simple yet effective shift operation. A residual combination method prevents information loss by integrating shifted and original features. The TS module is lightweight, requiring only one additional learnable parameter, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing architectures with minimal additional computational cost. TS-SNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like CIFAR-10 (96.72\%), CIFAR-100 (80.28\%), and ImageNet (70.61\%) with fewer timesteps, while maintaining low energy consumption. This work marks a significant step forward in developing efficient and accurate SNN architectures.

Abstract: Wireless roaming is a critical yet challenging task for maintaining seamless connectivity in dynamic mobile environments. Conventional threshold-based or heuristic schemes often fail, leading to either sticky or excessive handovers. We introduce the first cross-layer use of an on-device large language model (LLM): high-level reasoning in the application layer that issues real-time actions executed in the PHY/MAC stack. The LLM addresses two tasks: (i) context-aware AP selection, where structured prompts fuse environmental cues (e.g., location, time) to choose the best BSSID; and (ii) dynamic threshold adjustment, where the model adaptively decides when to roam. To satisfy the tight latency and resource budgets of edge hardware, we apply a suite of optimizations-chain-of-thought prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and quantization. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that our approach surpasses legacy heuristics and DRL baselines, achieving a strong balance between roaming stability and signal quality. These findings underscore the promise of application-layer LLM reasoning for lower-layer wireless control in future edge systems.

Abstract: Text recognition in natural images remains a challenging yet essential task, with broad applications spanning computer vision and natural language processing. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework that combines ResNet and Vision Transformer backbones with advanced methodologies, including Deformable Convolutions, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Conditional Random Fields (CRF). These innovations collectively enhance feature representation and improve Optical Character Recognition (OCR) performance. Specifically, the framework substitutes standard convolution layers in the third and fourth blocks with Deformable Convolutions, leverages adaptive dropout for regularization, and incorporates CRF for more refined sequence modeling. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets IC13, IC15, SVT, IIIT5K, SVTP, and CUTE80 validate the proposed method's efficacy, achieving notable accuracies: 97.32% on IC13, 58.26% on IC15, 88.10% on SVT, 74.13% on IIIT5K, 82.17% on SVTP, and 66.67% on CUTE80, resulting in an average accuracy of 77.77%. These results establish a new state-of-the-art for text recognition, demonstrating the robustness of the approach across diverse and challenging datasets.

Abstract: Generating high-quality 3D models from 2D sketches is a challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity and sparsity of sketch data. In this paper, we present S3D, a novel framework that converts simple hand-drawn sketches into detailed 3D models. Our method utilizes a U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture to convert sketches into face segmentation masks, which are then used to generate a 3D representation that can be rendered from novel views. To ensure robust consistency between the sketch domain and the 3D output, we introduce a novel style-alignment loss that aligns the U-Net bottleneck features with the initial encoder outputs of the 3D generation module, significantly enhancing reconstruction fidelity. To further enhance the network's robustness, we apply augmentation techniques to the sketch dataset. This streamlined framework demonstrates the effectiveness of S3D in generating high-quality 3D models from sketch inputs.

Abstract: We present VideoPath-LLaVA, the first large multimodal model (LMM) in computational pathology that integrates three distinct image scenarios, single patch images, automatically keyframe-extracted clips, and manually segmented video pathology images, to mimic the natural diagnostic process of pathologists. By generating detailed histological descriptions and culminating in a definitive sign-out diagnosis, VideoPath-LLaVA bridges visual narratives with diagnostic reasoning.
  Central to our approach is the VideoPath-Instruct dataset, comprising 4278 video and diagnosis-specific chain-of-thought instructional pairs sourced from educational histopathology videos on YouTube. Although high-quality data is critical for enhancing diagnostic reasoning, its creation is time-intensive and limited in volume. To overcome this challenge, we transfer knowledge from existing single-image instruction datasets to train on weakly annotated, keyframe-extracted clips, followed by fine-tuning on manually segmented videos. VideoPath-LLaVA establishes a new benchmark in pathology video analysis and offers a promising foundation for future AI systems that support clinical decision-making through integrated visual and diagnostic reasoning. Our code, data, and model are publicly available at https://github.com/trinhvg/VideoPath-LLaVA.

<title>An Enhanced YOLOv8 Model for Real-Time and Accurate Pothole Detection and Measurement</title>

Abstract: Potholes cause vehicle damage and traffic accidents, creating serious safety and economic problems. Therefore, early and accurate detection of potholes is crucial. Existing detection methods are usually only based on 2D RGB images and cannot accurately analyze the physical characteristics of potholes. In this paper, a publicly available dataset of RGB-D images (PothRGBD) is created and an improved YOLOv8-based model is proposed for both pothole detection and pothole physical features analysis. The Intel RealSense D415 depth camera was used to collect RGB and depth data from the road surfaces, resulting in a PothRGBD dataset of 1000 images. The data was labeled in YOLO format suitable for segmentation. A novel YOLO model is proposed based on the YOLOv8n-seg architecture, which is structurally improved with Dynamic Snake Convolution (DSConv), Simple Attention Module (SimAM) and Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU). The proposed model segmented potholes with irregular edge structure more accurately, and performed perimeter and depth measurements on depth maps with high accuracy. The standard YOLOv8n-seg model achieved 91.9% precision, 85.2% recall and 91.9% mAP@50. With the proposed model, the values increased to 93.7%, 90.4% and 93.8% respectively. Thus, an improvement of 1.96% in precision, 6.13% in recall and 2.07% in mAP was achieved. The proposed model performs pothole detection as well as perimeter and depth measurement with high accuracy and is suitable for real-time applications due to its low model complexity. In this way, a lightweight and effective model that can be used in deep learning-based intelligent transportation solutions has been acquired.

Abstract: E-commerce sellers are recommended keyphrases based on their inventory on which they advertise to increase buyer engagement (clicks/sales). The relevance of advertiser keyphrases plays an important role in preventing the inundation of search systems with numerous irrelevant items that compete for attention in auctions, in addition to maintaining a healthy seller perception. In this work, we describe the shortcomings of training Advertiser keyphrase relevance filter models on click/sales/search relevance signals and the importance of aligning with human judgment, as sellers have the power to adopt or reject said keyphrase recommendations. In this study, we frame Advertiser keyphrase relevance as a complex interaction between 3 dynamical systems -- seller judgment, which influences seller adoption of our product, Advertising, which provides the keyphrases to bid on, and Search, who holds the auctions for the same keyphrases. This study discusses the practicalities of using human judgment via a case study at eBay Advertising and demonstrate that using LLM-as-a-judge en-masse as a scalable proxy for seller judgment to train our relevance models achieves a better harmony across the three systems -- provided that they are bound by a meticulous evaluation framework grounded in business metrics.

<title>FRAIN to Train: A Fast-and-Reliable Solution for Decentralized Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data locality. Although FedAvg pioneered synchronous rounds for global model averaging, slower devices can delay collective progress. Asynchronous FL (e.g., FedAsync) addresses stragglers by continuously integrating client updates, yet naive implementations risk client drift due to non-IID data and stale contributions. Some Blockchain-based FL approaches (e.g., BRAIN) employ robust weighting or scoring of updates to resist malicious or misaligned proposals. However, performance drops can still persist under severe data heterogeneity or high staleness, and synchronization overhead has emerged as a new concern due to its aggregator-free architectures.
  We introduce Fast-and-Reliable AI Network, FRAIN, a new asynchronous FL method that mitigates these limitations by incorporating two key ideas. First, our FastSync strategy eliminates the need to replay past model versions, enabling newcomers and infrequent participants to efficiently approximate the global model. Second, we adopt spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) when merging parameters, preserving models' directions and alleviating destructive interference from divergent local training.
  Experiments with a CNN image-classification model and a Transformer-based language model demonstrate that FRAIN achieves more stable and robust convergence than FedAvg, FedAsync, and BRAIN, especially under harsh environments: non-IID data distributions, networks that experience delays and require frequent re-synchronization, and the presence of malicious nodes.

Abstract: Multi-agent autonomous systems (MAS) are better at addressing challenges that spans across multiple domains than singular autonomous agents. This holds true within the field of software engineering (SE) as well. The state-of-the-art research on MAS within SE focuses on integrating LLMs at the core of autonomous agents to create LLM-based multi-agent autonomous (LMA) systems. However, the introduction of LMA systems into SE brings a plethora of challenges. One of the major challenges is the strategic allocation of tasks between humans and the LMA system in a trustworthy manner. To address this challenge, a RACI-based framework is proposed in this work in progress article, along with implementation guidelines and an example implementation of the framework. The proposed framework can facilitate efficient collaboration, ensure accountability, and mitigate potential risks associated with LLM-driven automation while aligning with the Trustworthy AI guidelines. The future steps for this work delineating the planned empirical validation method are also presented.

<title>Steerable Chatbots: Personalizing LLMs with Preference-Based Activation Steering</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) improve in their capacity to serve as personal AI assistants, their ability to output uniquely tailored, personalized responses that align with the soft preferences of their users is essential for enhancing user satisfaction and retention. However, untrained lay users have poor prompt specification abilities and often struggle with conveying their latent preferences to AI assistants. To address this, we leverage activation steering to guide LLMs to align with interpretable preference dimensions during inference. In contrast to memory-based personalization methods that require longer user history, steering is extremely lightweight and can be easily controlled by the user via an linear strength factor. We embed steering into three different interactive chatbot interfaces and conduct a within-subjects user study (n=14) to investigate how end users prefer to personalize their conversations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of preference-based steering for aligning real-world conversations with hidden user preferences, and highlight further insights on how diverse values around control, usability, and transparency lead users to prefer different interfaces.

Abstract: This, with the ever-increasing sophistication of cyberwar, calls for novel solutions. In this regard, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a highly promising tool for defensive and offensive cybersecurity-related strategies. While existing literature has focused much on the defensive use of LLMs, when it comes to their offensive utilization, very little has been reported-namely, concerning Vulnerability Assessment (VA) report validation. Consequentially, this paper tries to fill that gap by investigating the capabilities of LLMs in automating and improving the validation process of the report of the VA. From the critical review of the related literature, this paper hereby proposes a new approach to using the LLMs in the automation of the analysis and within the validation process of the report of the VA that could potentially reduce the number of false positives and generally enhance efficiency. These results are promising for LLM automatization for improving validation on reports coming from VA in order to improve accuracy while reducing human effort and security postures. The contribution of this paper provides further evidence about the offensive and defensive LLM capabilities and therefor helps in devising more appropriate cybersecurity strategies and tools accordingly.

Abstract: Egocentric video grounding is a crucial task for embodied intelligence applications, distinct from exocentric video moment localization. Existing methods primarily focus on the distributional differences between egocentric and exocentric videos but often neglect key characteristics of egocentric videos and the fine-grained information emphasized by question-type queries. To address these limitations, we propose OSGNet, an Object-Shot enhanced Grounding Network for egocentric video. Specifically, we extract object information from videos to enrich video representation, particularly for objects highlighted in the textual query but not directly captured in the video features. Additionally, we analyze the frequent shot movements inherent to egocentric videos, leveraging these features to extract the wearer's attention information, which enhances the model's ability to perform modality alignment. Experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that OSGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our code can be found at https://github.com/Yisen-Feng/OSGNet.

<title>Non-stationary Diffusion For Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Due to the dynamics of underlying physics and external influences, the uncertainty of time series often varies over time. However, existing Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) often fail to capture this non-stationary nature, constrained by their constant variance assumption from the additive noise model (ANM). In this paper, we innovatively utilize the Location-Scale Noise Model (LSNM) to relax the fixed uncertainty assumption of ANM. A diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework, termed Non-stationary Diffusion (NsDiff), is designed based on LSNM that is capable of modeling the changing pattern of uncertainty. Specifically, NsDiff combines a denoising diffusion-based conditional generative model with a pre-trained conditional mean and variance estimator, enabling adaptive endpoint distribution modeling. Furthermore, we propose an uncertainty-aware noise schedule, which dynamically adjusts the noise levels to accurately reflect the data uncertainty at each step and integrates the time-varying variances into the diffusion process. Extensive experiments conducted on nine real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of NsDiff compared to existing approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/wwy155/NsDiff.

<title>GASCADE: Grouped Summarization of Adverse Drug Event for Enhanced Cancer Pharmacovigilance</title>

Abstract: In the realm of cancer treatment, summarizing adverse drug events (ADEs) reported by patients using prescribed drugs is crucial for enhancing pharmacovigilance practices and improving drug-related decision-making. While the volume and complexity of pharmacovigilance data have increased, existing research in this field has predominantly focused on general diseases rather than specifically addressing cancer. This work introduces the task of grouped summarization of adverse drug events reported by multiple patients using the same drug for cancer treatment. To address the challenge of limited resources in cancer pharmacovigilance, we present the MultiLabeled Cancer Adverse Drug Reaction and Summarization (MCADRS) dataset. This dataset includes pharmacovigilance posts detailing patient concerns regarding drug efficacy and adverse effects, along with extracted labels for drug names, adverse drug events, severity, and adversity of reactions, as well as summaries of ADEs for each drug. Additionally, we propose the Grouping and Abstractive Summarization of Cancer Adverse Drug events (GASCADE) framework, a novel pipeline that combines the information extraction capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the summarization power of the encoder-decoder T5 model. Our work is the first to apply alignment techniques, including advanced algorithms like Direct Preference Optimization, to encoder-decoder models using synthetic datasets for summarization tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of GASCADE across various metrics, validated through both automated assessments and human evaluations. This multitasking approach enhances drug-related decision-making and fosters a deeper understanding of patient concerns, paving the way for advancements in personalized and responsive cancer care. The code and dataset used in this work are publicly available.

<title>Sparsity is All You Need: Rethinking Biological Pathway-Informed Approaches in Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Biologically-informed neural networks typically leverage pathway annotations to enhance performance in biomedical applications. We hypothesized that the benefits of pathway integration does not arise from its biological relevance, but rather from the sparsity it introduces. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of all relevant pathway-based neural network models for predictive tasks, critically evaluating each study's contributions. From this review, we curated a subset of methods for which the source code was publicly available. The comparison of the biologically informed state-of-the-art deep learning models and their randomized counterparts showed that models based on randomized information performed equally well as biologically informed ones across different metrics and datasets. Notably, in 3 out of the 15 analyzed models, the randomized versions even outperformed their biologically informed counterparts. Moreover, pathway-informed models did not show any clear advantage in interpretability, as randomized models were still able to identify relevant disease biomarkers despite lacking explicit pathway information. Our findings suggest that pathway annotations may be too noisy or inadequately explored by current methods. Therefore, we propose a methodology that can be applied to different domains and can serve as a robust benchmark for systematically comparing novel pathway-informed models against their randomized counterparts. This approach enables researchers to rigorously determine whether observed performance improvements can be attributed to biological insights.

Abstract: As the adoption of deep learning models has grown beyond human capacity for verification, meta-algorithms are needed to ensure reliable model inference. Concept drift detection is a field dedicated to identifying statistical shifts that is underutilized in monitoring neural networks that may encounter inference data with distributional characteristics diverging from their training data. Given the wide variety of model architectures, applications, and datasets, it is important that concept drift detection algorithms are adaptable to different inference scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an application of the $\chi^2$ Goodness of Fit Hypothesis Test as a drift detection meta-algorithm applied to a multilayer perceptron, a convolutional neural network, and a transformer trained for machine vision as they are exposed to simulated drift during inference. To that end, we demonstrate how unexpected drops in accuracy due to concept drift can be detected without directly examining the inference outputs. Our approach enhances safety by ensuring models are continually evaluated for reliability across varying conditions.

<title>Multi-Granular Attention based Heterogeneous Hypergraph Neural Network</title>

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HeteGNNs) have demonstrated strong abilities to learn node representations by effectively extracting complex structural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs. Most of the prevailing HeteGNNs follow the neighborhood aggregation paradigm, leveraging meta-path based message passing to learn latent node representations. However, due to the pairwise nature of meta-paths, these models fail to capture high-order relations among nodes, resulting in suboptimal performance. Additionally, the challenge of ``over-squashing'', where long-range message passing in HeteGNNs leads to severe information distortion, further limits the efficacy of these models. To address these limitations, this paper proposes MGA-HHN, a Multi-Granular Attention based Heterogeneous Hypergraph Neural Network for heterogeneous graph representation learning. MGA-HHN introduces two key innovations: (1) a novel approach for constructing meta-path based heterogeneous hypergraphs that explicitly models higher-order semantic information in heterogeneous graphs through multiple views, and (2) a multi-granular attention mechanism that operates at both the node and hyperedge levels. This mechanism enables the model to capture fine-grained interactions among nodes sharing the same semantic context within a hyperedge type, while preserving the diversity of semantics across different hyperedge types. As such, MGA-HHN effectively mitigates long-range message distortion and generates more expressive node representations. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MGA-HHN outperforms state-of-the-art models, showcasing its effectiveness in node classification, node clustering and visualization tasks.

<title>Optimization Problem Solving Can Transition to Evolutionary Agentic Workflows</title>

Abstract: This position paper argues that optimization problem solving can transition from expert-dependent to evolutionary agentic workflows. Traditional optimization practices rely on human specialists for problem formulation, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning, creating bottlenecks that impede industrial adoption of cutting-edge methods. We contend that an evolutionary agentic workflow, powered by foundation models and evolutionary search, can autonomously navigate the optimization space, comprising problem, formulation, algorithm, and hyperparameter spaces. Through case studies in cloud resource scheduling and ADMM parameter adaptation, we demonstrate how this approach can bridge the gap between academic innovation and industrial implementation. Our position challenges the status quo of human-centric optimization workflows and advocates for a more scalable, adaptive approach to solving real-world optimization problems.

<title>Balancing Accuracy, Calibration, and Efficiency in Active Learning with Vision Transformers Under Label Noise</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.04375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained convolutional neural networks on ImageNet for downstream tasks is well-established. Still, the impact of model size on the performance of vision transformers in similar scenarios, particularly under label noise, remains largely unexplored. Given the utility and versatility of transformer architectures, this study investigates their practicality under low-budget constraints and noisy labels. We explore how classification accuracy and calibration are affected by symmetric label noise in active learning settings, evaluating four vision transformer configurations (Base and Large with 16x16 and 32x32 patch sizes) and three Swin Transformer configurations (Tiny, Small, and Base) on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, under varying label noise rates. Our findings show that larger ViT models (ViTl32 in particular) consistently outperform their smaller counterparts in both accuracy and calibration, even under moderate to high label noise, while Swin Transformers exhibit weaker robustness across all noise levels. We find that smaller patch sizes do not always lead to better performance, as ViTl16 performs consistently worse than ViTl32 while incurring a higher computational cost. We also find that information-based Active Learning strategies only provide meaningful accuracy improvements at moderate label noise rates, but they result in poorer calibration compared to models trained on randomly acquired labels, especially at high label noise rates. We hope these insights provide actionable guidance for practitioners looking to deploy vision transformers in resource-constrained environments, where balancing model complexity, label noise, and compute efficiency is critical in model fine-tuning or distillation.

Abstract: Transportation systems have long been shaped by complexity and heterogeneity, driven by the interdependency of agent actions and traffic outcomes. The deployment of automated vehicles (AVs) in such systems introduces a new challenge: achieving consensus across safety, interaction quality, and traffic performance. In this work, we position consensus as a fundamental property of the traffic system and aim to quantify it. We use high-resolution trajectory data from the Third Generation Simulation (TGSIM) dataset to empirically analyze AV and human-driven vehicle (HDV) behavior at a signalized urban intersection and around vulnerable road users (VRUs). Key metrics, including Time-to-Collision (TTC), Post-Encroachment Time (PET), deceleration patterns, headways, and string stability, are evaluated across the three performance dimensions. Results show that full consensus across safety, interaction, and performance is rare, with only 1.63% of AV-VRU interaction frames meeting all three conditions. These findings highlight the need for AV models that explicitly balance multi-dimensional performance in mixed-traffic environments. Full reproducibility is supported via our open-source codebase on https://github.com/wissamkontar/Consensus-AV-Analysis.

Abstract: We propose a deep product-unit residual neural network (PURe) that integrates product units into residual blocks to improve the expressiveness and parameter efficiency of deep convolutional networks. Unlike standard summation neurons, product units enable multiplicative feature interactions, potentially offering a more powerful representation of complex patterns. PURe replaces conventional convolutional layers with 2D product units in the second layer of each residual block, eliminating nonlinear activation functions to preserve structural information. We validate PURe on three benchmark datasets. On Galaxy10 DECaLS, PURe34 achieves the highest test accuracy of 84.89%, surpassing the much deeper ResNet152, while converging nearly five times faster and demonstrating strong robustness to Poisson noise. On ImageNet, PURe architectures outperform standard ResNet models at similar depths, with PURe34 achieving a top-1 accuracy of 80.27% and top-5 accuracy of 95.78%, surpassing deeper ResNet variants (ResNet50, ResNet101) while utilizing significantly fewer parameters and computational resources. On CIFAR-10, PURe consistently outperforms ResNet variants across varying depths, with PURe272 reaching 95.01% test accuracy, comparable to ResNet1001 but at less than half the model size. These results demonstrate that PURe achieves a favorable balance between accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Compared to traditional residual networks, PURe not only achieves competitive classification performance with faster convergence and fewer parameters, but also demonstrates greater robustness to noise. Its effectiveness across diverse datasets highlights the potential of product-unit-based architectures for scalable and reliable deep learning in computer vision.

<title>In-Context Adaptation to Concept Drift for Learned Database Operations</title>

Abstract: Machine learning has demonstrated transformative potential for database operations, such as query optimization and in-database data analytics. However, dynamic database environments, characterized by frequent updates and evolving data distributions, introduce concept drift, which leads to performance degradation for learned models and limits their practical applicability. Addressing this challenge requires efficient frameworks capable of adapting to shifting concepts while minimizing the overhead of retraining or fine-tuning.
  In this paper, we propose FLAIR, an online adaptation framework that introduces a new paradigm called \textit{in-context adaptation} for learned database operations. FLAIR leverages the inherent property of data systems, i.e., immediate availability of execution results for predictions, to enable dynamic context construction. By formalizing adaptation as $f:(\mathbf{x} \,| \,\mathcal{C}_t) \to \mathbf{y}$, with $\mathcal{C}_t$ representing a dynamic context memory, FLAIR delivers predictions aligned with the current concept, eliminating the need for runtime parameter optimization. To achieve this, FLAIR integrates two key modules: a Task Featurization Module for encoding task-specific features into standardized representations, and a Dynamic Decision Engine, pre-trained via Bayesian meta-training, to adapt seamlessly using contextual information at runtime. Extensive experiments across key database tasks demonstrate that FLAIR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 5.2x faster adaptation and reducing error by 22.5% for cardinality estimation.

Abstract: Optical systems have been pivotal for energy-efficient computing, performing high-speed, parallel operations in low-loss carriers. While these predominantly analog optical accelerators bypass digitization to perform parallel floating-point computations, scaling optical hardware to map large-vector sizes for AI tasks remains challenging. Here, we overcome this limitation by unfolding scalar operations in time and introducing a photonic-heater-in-lightpath (PHIL) unit for all-optical temporal integration. Counterintuitively, we exploit a slow heat dissipation process to integrate optical signals modulated at 50 GHz bridging the speed gap between the widely applied thermo-optic effects and ultrafast photonics. This architecture supports optical end-to-end signal processing, eliminates inefficient electro-optical conversions, and enables both linear and nonlinear operations within a unified framework. Our results demonstrate a scalable path towards high-speed photonic computing through thermally driven integration.

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate the ability to solve various programming tasks, including code generation. Typically, the performance of LLMs is measured on benchmarks with small or medium-sized context windows of thousands of lines of code. At the same time, in real-world software projects, repositories can span up to millions of LoC. This paper closes this gap by contributing to the long context code generation benchmark (YABLoCo). The benchmark featured a test set of 215 functions selected from four large repositories with thousands of functions. The dataset contained metadata of functions, contexts of the functions with different levels of dependencies, docstrings, functions bodies, and call graphs for each repository. This paper presents three key aspects of the contribution. First, the benchmark aims at function body generation in large repositories in C and C++, two languages not covered by previous benchmarks. Second, the benchmark contains large repositories from 200K to 2,000K LoC. Third, we contribute a scalable evaluation pipeline for efficient computing of the target metrics and a tool for visual analysis of generated code. Overall, these three aspects allow for evaluating code generation in large repositories in C and C++.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained over extensive corpora risk memorizing sensitive, copyrighted, or toxic content. To address this, we propose OBLIVIATE, a robust unlearning framework that removes targeted data while preserving model utility. The framework follows a structured process: extracting target tokens, building retain sets, and fine-tuning with a tailored loss function comprising three components -- masking, distillation, and world fact. Using low-rank adapters (LoRA), it ensures efficiency without compromising unlearning quality. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets, including the Harry Potter series, WMDP, and TOFU, using a comprehensive suite of metrics: forget quality (new document-level memorization score), model utility, and fluency. Results demonstrate its effectiveness in resisting membership inference attacks, minimizing the impact on retained data, and maintaining robustness across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Ornamentations, embellishments, or microtonal inflections are essential to melodic expression across many musical traditions, adding depth, nuance, and emotional impact to performances. Recognizing ornamentations in singing voices is key to MIR, with potential applications in music pedagogy, singer identification, genre classification, and controlled singing voice generation. However, the lack of annotated datasets and specialized modeling approaches remains a major obstacle for progress in this research area. In this work, we introduce R\=aga Ornamentation Detection (ROD), a novel dataset comprising Indian classical music recordings curated by expert musicians. The dataset is annotated using a custom Human-in-the-Loop tool for six vocal ornaments marked as event-based labels. Using this dataset, we develop an ornamentation detection model based on deep time-series analysis, preserving ornament boundaries during the chunking of long audio recordings. We conduct experiments using different train-test configurations within the ROD dataset and also evaluate our approach on a separate, manually annotated dataset of Indian classical concert recordings. Our experimental results support the superior performance of our proposed approach over the baseline CRNN.

<title>FedBWO: Enhancing Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed Machine Learning (ML) setup, where a shared model is collaboratively trained by various clients using their local datasets while keeping the data private. Considering resource-constrained devices, FL clients often suffer from restricted transmission capacity. Aiming to enhance the system performance, the communication between clients and server needs to be diminished. Current FL strategies transmit a tremendous amount of data (model weights) within the FL process, which needs a high communication bandwidth. Considering resource constraints, increasing the number of clients and, consequently, the amount of data (model weights) can lead to a bottleneck. In this paper, we introduce the Federated Black Widow Optimization (FedBWO) technique to decrease the amount of transmitted data by transmitting only a performance score rather than the local model weights from clients. FedBWO employs the BWO algorithm to improve local model updates. The conducted experiments prove that FedBWO remarkably improves the performance of the global model and the communication efficiency of the overall system. According to the experimental outcomes, FedBWO enhances the global model accuracy by an average of 21% over FedAvg, and 12% over FedGWO. Furthermore, FedBWO dramatically decreases the communication cost compared to other methods.

Abstract: Automatic music transcription (AMT) is the problem of analyzing an audio recording of a musical piece and detecting notes that are being played. AMT is a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to polyphonic music. The goal of AMT is to produce a score representation of a music piece, by analyzing a sound signal containing multiple notes played simultaneously. In this work, we design a processing pipeline that can transform classical piano audio files in .wav format into a music score representation. The features from the audio signals are extracted using the constant-Q transform, and the resulting coefficients are used as an input to the convolutional neural network (CNN) model.

Abstract: Temporal interaction graphs (TIGs), defined by sequences of timestamped interaction events, have become ubiquitous in real-world applications due to their capability to model complex dynamic system behaviors. As a result, temporal interaction graph representation learning (TIGRL) has garnered significant attention in recent years. TIGRL aims to embed nodes in TIGs into low-dimensional representations that effectively preserve both structural and temporal information, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as classification, prediction, and clustering within constantly evolving data environments. In this paper, we begin by introducing the foundational concepts of TIGs and emphasize the critical role of temporal dependencies. We then propose a comprehensive taxonomy of state-of-the-art TIGRL methods, systematically categorizing them based on the types of information utilized during the learning process to address the unique challenges inherent to TIGs. To facilitate further research and practical applications, we curate the source of datasets and benchmarks, providing valuable resources for empirical investigations. Finally, we examine key open challenges and explore promising research directions in TIGRL, laying the groundwork for future advancements that have the potential to shape the evolution of this field.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of clustering models is a challenging task where the outcome depends on the definition of what constitutes a cluster. Due to this design, current existing metrics rarely handle multiple clustering models with diverse cluster definitions, nor do they comply with the integration of constraints when available. In this work, we take inspiration from consensus clustering and assume that a set of clustering models is able to uncover hidden structures in the data. We propose to construct a discriminative ordering through ensemble clustering based on the distance between the connectivity of a clustering model and the consensus matrix. We first validate the proposed method with synthetic scenarios, highlighting that the proposed score ranks the models that best match the consensus first. We then show that this simple ranking score significantly outperforms other scoring methods when comparing sets of different clustering algorithms that are not restricted to a fixed number of clusters and is compatible with clustering constraints.

Abstract: This paper introduces the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a differentially private optimization method that addresses the challenge of preserving performance in DP-SGD, where added noise typically degrades model utility. FFTKF integrates frequency-domain noise shaping with Kalman filtering to enhance gradient quality while preserving $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees. It employs a high-frequency shaping mask in the Fourier domain to concentrate differential privacy noise in less informative spectral components, preserving low-frequency gradient signals. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with finite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients. With a per-iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$, FFTKF demonstrates improved test accuracy over DP-SGD and DiSK across MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets using CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers. Theoretical analysis confirms that FFTKF maintains equivalent privacy guarantees while achieving a tighter privacy-utility trade-off through reduced noise and controlled bias.

<title>Efficient Flow Matching using Latent Variables</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Flow matching models have shown great potential in image generation tasks among probabilistic generative models. Building upon the ideas of continuous normalizing flows, flow matching models generalize the transport path of the diffusion models from a simple prior distribution to the data. Most flow matching models in the literature do not explicitly model the underlying structure/manifold in the target data when learning the flow from a simple source distribution like the standard Gaussian. This leads to inefficient learning, especially for many high-dimensional real-world datasets, which often reside in a low-dimensional manifold. Existing strategies of incorporating manifolds, including data with underlying multi-modal distribution, often require expensive training and hence frequently lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we present \texttt{Latent-CFM}, which provides simplified training/inference strategies to incorporate multi-modal data structures using pretrained deep latent variable models. Through experiments on multi-modal synthetic data and widely used image benchmark datasets, we show that \texttt{Latent-CFM} exhibits improved generation quality with significantly less training ($\sim 50\%$ less in some cases) and computation than state-of-the-art flow matching models. Using a 2d Darcy flow dataset, we demonstrate that our approach generates more physically accurate samples than competitive approaches. In addition, through latent space analysis, we demonstrate that our approach can be used for conditional image generation conditioned on latent features.

<title>"I Can See Forever!": Evaluating Real-time VideoLLMs for Assisting Individuals with Visual Impairments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04488</link>

Abstract: The visually impaired population, especially the severely visually impaired, is currently large in scale, and daily activities pose significant challenges for them. Although many studies use large language and vision-language models to assist the blind, most focus on static content and fail to meet real-time perception needs in dynamic and complex environments, such as daily activities. To provide them with more effective intelligent assistance, it is imperative to incorporate advanced visual understanding technologies. Although real-time vision and speech interaction VideoLLMs demonstrate strong real-time visual understanding, no prior work has systematically evaluated their effectiveness in assisting visually impaired individuals. In this work, we conduct the first such evaluation. First, we construct a benchmark dataset (VisAssistDaily), covering three categories of assistive tasks for visually impaired individuals: Basic Skills, Home Life Tasks, and Social Life Tasks. The results show that GPT-4o achieves the highest task success rate. Next, we conduct a user study to evaluate the models in both closed-world and open-world scenarios, further exploring the practical challenges of applying VideoLLMs in assistive contexts. One key issue we identify is the difficulty current models face in perceiving potential hazards in dynamic environments. To address this, we build an environment-awareness dataset named SafeVid and introduce a polling mechanism that enables the model to proactively detect environmental risks. We hope this work provides valuable insights and inspiration for future research in this field.

Abstract: Model-based planning and execution systems offer a principled approach to building flexible autonomous robots that can perform diverse tasks by automatically combining a host of basic skills. This idea is almost as old as modern robotics. Yet, while diverse general-purpose reasoning architectures have been proposed since, general-purpose systems that are integrated with modern robotic platforms have emerged only recently, starting with the influential ROSPlan system. Since then, a growing number of model-based systems for robot task-level control have emerged. In this paper, we consider the diverse design choices and issues existing systems attempt to address, the different solutions proposed so far, and suggest avenues for future development.

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion is one of the most crucial tasks in the field of image fusion, aiming to generate fused images with clear structural information and high-quality texture features for high-level vision tasks. However, when faced with severe illumination degradation in visible images, the fusion results of existing image fusion methods often exhibit blurry and dim visual effects, posing major challenges for autonomous driving. To this end, a Darkness-Free network is proposed to handle Visible and infrared image disentanglement and fusion all at Once (DFVO), which employs a cascaded multi-task approach to replace the traditional two-stage cascaded training (enhancement and fusion), addressing the issue of information entropy loss caused by hierarchical data transmission. Specifically, we construct a latent-common feature extractor (LCFE) to obtain latent features for the cascaded tasks strategy. Firstly, a details-extraction module (DEM) is devised to acquire high-frequency semantic information. Secondly, we design a hyper cross-attention module (HCAM) to extract low-frequency information and preserve texture features from source images. Finally, a relevant loss function is designed to guide the holistic network learning, thereby achieving better image fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Particularly, DFVO can generate clearer, more informative, and more evenly illuminated fusion results in the dark environments, achieving best performance on the LLVIP dataset with 63.258 dB PSNR and 0.724 CC, providing more effective information for high-level vision tasks. Our code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/DaVin-Qi530/DFVO.

Abstract: Generative language modelling has surged in popularity with the emergence of services such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini. While these models have demonstrated transformative potential in productivity and communication, they overwhelmingly cater to high-resource languages like English. This has amplified concerns over linguistic inequality in natural language processing (NLP). This paper presents the first systematic review focused specifically on strategies to address data scarcity in generative language modelling for low-resource languages (LRL). Drawing from 54 studies, we identify, categorise and evaluate technical approaches, including monolingual data augmentation, back-translation, multilingual training, and prompt engineering, across generative tasks. We also analyse trends in architecture choices, language family representation, and evaluation methods. Our findings highlight a strong reliance on transformer-based models, a concentration on a small subset of LRLs, and a lack of consistent evaluation across studies. We conclude with recommendations for extending these methods to a wider range of LRLs and outline open challenges in building equitable generative language systems. Ultimately, this review aims to support researchers and developers in building inclusive AI tools for underrepresented languages, a necessary step toward empowering LRL speakers and the preservation of linguistic diversity in a world increasingly shaped by large-scale language technologies.

Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework under a broad class of risk objectives, characterized by convex scoring functions. This class covers many common risk measures, such as variance, Expected Shortfall, entropic Value-at-Risk, and mean-risk utility. To resolve the time-inconsistency issue, we consider an augmented state space and an auxiliary variable and recast the problem as a two-state optimization problem. We propose a customized Actor-Critic algorithm and establish some theoretical approximation guarantees. A key theoretical contribution is that our results do not require the Markov decision process to be continuous. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary variable sampling method inspired by the alternating minimization algorithm, which is convergent under certain conditions. We validate our approach in simulation experiments with a financial application in statistical arbitrage trading, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm.

Abstract: Achieving generalization in neural approaches across different scales and distributions remains a significant challenge for the Traveling Salesman Problem~(TSP). A key obstacle is that neural networks often fail to learn robust principles for identifying universal patterns and deriving optimal solutions from diverse instances. In this paper, we first uncover Purity Law (PuLa), a fundamental structural principle for optimal TSP solutions, defining that edge prevalence grows exponentially with the sparsity of surrounding vertices. Statistically validated across diverse instances, PuLa reveals a consistent bias toward local sparsity in global optima. Building on this insight, we propose Purity Policy Optimization~(PUPO), a novel training paradigm that explicitly aligns characteristics of neural solutions with PuLa during the solution construction process to enhance generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PUPO can be seamlessly integrated with popular neural solvers, significantly enhancing their generalization performance without incurring additional computational overhead during inference.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning transforms large language models while creating a vulnerability we experimentally verify: Our experiment shows that malicious RL fine-tuning dismantles safety guardrails with remarkable efficiency, requiring only 50 steps and minimal adversarial prompts, with harmful escalating from 0-2 to 7-9. This attack vector particularly threatens open-source models with parameter-level access. Existing defenses targeting supervised fine-tuning prove ineffective against RL's dynamic feedback mechanisms. We introduce Reward Neutralization, the first defense framework specifically designed against RL fine-tuning attacks, establishing concise rejection patterns that render malicious reward signals ineffective. Our approach trains models to produce minimal-information rejections that attackers cannot exploit, systematically neutralizing attempts to optimize toward harmful outputs. Experiments validate that our approach maintains low harmful scores (no greater than 2) after 200 attack steps, while standard models rapidly deteriorate. This work provides the first constructive proof that robust defense against increasingly accessible RL attacks is achievable, addressing a critical security gap for open-weight models.

Abstract: Humanity appears to be on course to soon develop AI systems that substantially outperform human experts in all cognitive domains and activities. We believe the default trajectory has a high likelihood of catastrophe, including human extinction. Risks come from failure to control powerful AI systems, misuse of AI by malicious rogue actors, war between great powers, and authoritarian lock-in. This research agenda has two aims: to describe the strategic landscape of AI development and to catalog important governance research questions. These questions, if answered, would provide important insight on how to successfully reduce catastrophic risks.
  We describe four high-level scenarios for the geopolitical response to advanced AI development, cataloging the research questions most relevant to each. Our favored scenario involves building the technical, legal, and institutional infrastructure required to internationally restrict dangerous AI development and deployment (which we refer to as an Off Switch), which leads into an internationally coordinated Halt on frontier AI activities at some point in the future. The second scenario we describe is a US National Project for AI, in which the US Government races to develop advanced AI systems and establish unilateral control over global AI development. We also describe two additional scenarios: a Light-Touch world similar to that of today and a Threat of Sabotage situation where countries use sabotage and deterrence to slow AI development.
  In our view, apart from the Off Switch and Halt scenario, all of these trajectories appear to carry an unacceptable risk of catastrophic harm. Urgent action is needed from the US National Security community and AI governance ecosystem to answer key research questions, build the capability to halt dangerous AI activities, and prepare for international AI agreements.

Abstract: Responsibly deploying artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) systems in high-stakes settings arguably requires not only proof of system reliability, but moreover continual, post-deployment monitoring to quickly detect and address any unsafe behavior. Statistical methods for nonparametric change-point detection -- especially the tools of conformal test martingales (CTMs) and anytime-valid inference -- offer promising approaches to this monitoring task. However, existing methods are restricted to monitoring limited hypothesis classes or ``alarm criteria,'' such as data shifts that violate certain exchangeability assumptions, or do not allow for online adaptation in response to shifts. In this paper, we expand the scope of these monitoring methods by proposing a weighted generalization of conformal test martingales (WCTMs), which lay a theoretical foundation for online monitoring for any unexpected changepoints in the data distribution while controlling false-alarms. For practical applications, we propose specific WCTM algorithms that accommodate online adaptation to mild covariate shifts (in the marginal input distribution) while raising alarms in response to more severe shifts, such as concept shifts (in the conditional label distribution) or extreme (out-of-support) covariate shifts that cannot be easily adapted to. On real-world datasets, we demonstrate improved performance relative to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: We introduce Audio-SDS, a generalization of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to text-conditioned audio diffusion models. While SDS was initially designed for text-to-3D generation using image diffusion, its core idea of distilling a powerful generative prior into a separate parametric representation extends to the audio domain. Leveraging a single pretrained model, Audio-SDS enables a broad range of tasks without requiring specialized datasets. In particular, we demonstrate how Audio-SDS can guide physically informed impact sound simulations, calibrate FM-synthesis parameters, and perform prompt-specified source separation. Our findings illustrate the versatility of distillation-based methods across modalities and establish a robust foundation for future work using generative priors in audio tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced perception across text, vision, and audio, yet they often struggle with structured cross-modal reasoning, particularly when integrating audio and visual signals. We introduce EchoInk-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances such reasoning in MLLMs. Built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni-7B foundation and optimized with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EchoInk-R1 tackles multiple-choice question answering over synchronized audio-image pairs. To enable this, we curate AVQA-R1-6K, a dataset pairing such audio-image inputs with multiple-choice questions derived from OmniInstruct-v1. EchoInk-R1-7B achieves 85.77% accuracy on the validation set, outperforming the base model, which scores 80.53%, using only 562 reinforcement learning steps. Beyond accuracy, EchoInk-R1 demonstrates reflective reasoning by revisiting initial interpretations and refining responses when facing ambiguous multimodal inputs. These results suggest that lightweight reinforcement learning fine-tuning enhances cross-modal reasoning in MLLMs. EchoInk-R1 is the first framework to unify audio, visual, and textual modalities for general open-world reasoning via reinforcement learning. Code and data are publicly released to facilitate further research.

Abstract: In this paper, several techniques for learning game state evaluation functions by reinforcement are proposed. The first is a generalization of tree bootstrapping (tree learning): it is adapted to the context of reinforcement learning without knowledge based on non-linear functions. With this technique, no information is lost during the reinforcement learning process. The second is a modification of minimax with unbounded depth extending the best sequences of actions to the terminal states. This modified search is intended to be used during the learning process. The third is to replace the classic gain of a game (+1 / -1) with a reinforcement heuristic. We study particular reinforcement heuristics such as: quick wins and slow defeats ; scoring ; mobility or presence. The four is a new action selection distribution. The conducted experiments suggest that these techniques improve the level of play. Finally, we apply these different techniques to design program-players to the game of Hex (size 11 and 13) surpassing the level of Mohex 3HNN with reinforcement learning from self-play without knowledge.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a post-hoc and local explainable AI method tailored for Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models. These models are essential to Knowledge Graph Completion yet criticized for their opaque, black-box nature. Despite their significant success in capturing the semantics of knowledge graphs through high-dimensional latent representations, their inherent complexity poses substantial challenges to explainability. While existing methods like Kelpie use resource-intensive perturbation to explain KGE models, our approach directly decodes the latent representations encoded by KGE models, leveraging the smoothness of the embeddings, which follows the principle that similar embeddings reflect similar behaviours within the Knowledge Graph, meaning that nodes are similarly embedded because their graph neighbourhood looks similar. This principle is commonly referred to as smoothness. By identifying symbolic structures, in the form of triples, within the subgraph neighborhoods of similarly embedded entities, our method identifies the statistical regularities on which the models rely and translates these insights into human-understandable symbolic rules and facts. This bridges the gap between the abstract representations of KGE models and their predictive outputs, offering clear, interpretable insights. Key contributions include a novel post-hoc and local explainable AI method for KGE models that provides immediate, faithful explanations without retraining, facilitating real-time application on large-scale knowledge graphs. The method's flexibility enables the generation of rule-based, instance-based, and analogy-based explanations, meeting diverse user needs. Extensive evaluations show the effectiveness of our approach in delivering faithful and well-localized explanations, enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of KGE models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, and their application in edge scenarios has attracted significant attention. However, sparse-activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which are well suited for edge scenarios, have received relatively little attention due to their high memory demands. Offload-based methods have been proposed to address this challenge, but they face difficulties with expert prediction. Inaccurate expert predictions can result in prolonged inference delays. To promote the application of MoE models in edge scenarios, we propose Fate, an offloading system designed for MoE models to enable efficient inference in resource-constrained environments. The key insight behind Fate is that gate inputs from adjacent layers can be effectively used for expert prefetching, achieving high prediction accuracy without additional GPU overhead. Furthermore, Fate employs a shallow-favoring expert caching strategy that increases the expert hit rate to 99\%. Additionally, Fate integrates tailored quantization strategies for cache optimization and IO efficiency. Experimental results show that, compared to Load on Demand and Expert Activation Path-based method, Fate achieves up to 4.5x and 1.9x speedups in prefill speed and up to 4.1x and 2.2x speedups in decoding speed, respectively, while maintaining inference quality. Moreover, Fate's performance improvements are scalable across different memory budgets.

Abstract: The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into transportation planning has the potential to revolutionize tasks such as demand forecasting, infrastructure design, policy evaluation, and traffic simulation. However, there is a critical need for a systematic framework to guide the adoption of GenAI in this interdisciplinary domain. In this survey, we, a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and transportation engineering, present the first comprehensive framework for leveraging GenAI in transportation planning. Specifically, we introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes existing applications and methodologies into two perspectives: transportation planning tasks and computational techniques. From the transportation planning perspective, we examine the role of GenAI in automating descriptive, predictive, generative, simulation, and explainable tasks to enhance mobility systems. From the computational perspective, we detail advancements in data preparation, domain-specific fine-tuning, and inference strategies, such as retrieval-augmented generation and zero-shot learning tailored to transportation applications. Additionally, we address critical challenges, including data scarcity, explainability, bias mitigation, and the development of domain-specific evaluation frameworks that align with transportation goals like sustainability, equity, and system efficiency. This survey aims to bridge the gap between traditional transportation planning methodologies and modern AI techniques, fostering collaboration and innovation. By addressing these challenges and opportunities, we seek to inspire future research that ensures ethical, equitable, and impactful use of generative AI in transportation planning.

<title>Navigating Neural Space: Revisiting Concept Activation Vectors to Overcome Directional Divergence</title>

Abstract: With a growing interest in understanding neural network prediction strategies, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) have emerged as a popular tool for modeling human-understandable concepts in the latent space. Commonly, CAVs are computed by leveraging linear classifiers optimizing the separability of latent representations of samples with and without a given concept. However, in this paper we show that such a separability-oriented computation leads to solutions, which may diverge from the actual goal of precisely modeling the concept direction. This discrepancy can be attributed to the significant influence of distractor directions, i.e., signals unrelated to the concept, which are picked up by filters (i.e., weights) of linear models to optimize class-separability. To address this, we introduce pattern-based CAVs, solely focussing on concept signals, thereby providing more accurate concept directions. We evaluate various CAV methods in terms of their alignment with the true concept direction and their impact on CAV applications, including concept sensitivity testing and model correction for shortcut behavior caused by data artifacts. We demonstrate the benefits of pattern-based CAVs using the Pediatric Bone Age, ISIC2019, and FunnyBirds datasets with VGG, ResNet, ReXNet, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformer as model architectures.

<title>3D-IDS: Doubly Disentangled Dynamic Intrusion Detection</title>

Abstract: Network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) monitors network traffic for malicious activities, forming the frontline defense against increasing attacks over information infrastructures. Although promising, our quantitative analysis shows that existing methods perform inconsistently in declaring various unknown attacks (e.g., 9% and 35% F1 respectively for two distinct unknown threats for an SVM-based method) or detecting diverse known attacks (e.g., 31% F1 for the Backdoor and 93% F1 for DDoS by a GCN-based state-of-the-art method), and reveals that the underlying cause is entangled distributions of flow features. This motivates us to propose 3D-IDS, a novel method that aims to tackle the above issues through two-step feature disentanglements and a dynamic graph diffusion scheme. Specifically, we first disentangle traffic features by a non-parameterized optimization based on mutual information, automatically differentiating tens and hundreds of complex features of various attacks. Such differentiated features will be fed into a memory model to generate representations, which are further disentangled to highlight the attack-specific features. Finally, we use a novel graph diffusion method that dynamically fuses the network topology for spatial-temporal aggregation in evolving data streams. By doing so, we can effectively identify various attacks in encrypted traffics, including unknown threats and known ones that are not easily detected. Experiments show the superiority of our 3D-IDS. We also demonstrate that our two-step feature disentanglements benefit the explainability of NIDS.

Abstract: Music generation has attracted growing interest with the advancement of deep generative models. However, generating music conditioned on textual descriptions, known as text-to-music, remains challenging due to the complexity of musical structures and high sampling rate requirements. Despite the task's significance, prevailing generative models exhibit limitations in music quality, computational efficiency, and generalization. This paper introduces JEN-1, a universal high-fidelity model for text-to-music generation. JEN-1 is a diffusion model incorporating both autoregressive and non-autoregressive training. Through in-context learning, JEN-1 performs various generation tasks including text-guided music generation, music inpainting, and continuation. Evaluations demonstrate JEN-1's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in text-music alignment and music quality while maintaining computational efficiency.

<title>Recursively Summarizing Enables Long-Term Dialogue Memory in Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2308.15022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, stand out remarkable conversational abilities, enabling them to engage in dynamic and contextually relevant dialogues across a wide range of topics. However, given a long conversation, these chatbots fail to recall past information and tend to generate inconsistent responses. To address this, we propose to recursively generate summaries/ memory using large language models (LLMs) to enhance long-term memory ability. Specifically, our method first stimulates LLMs to memorize small dialogue contexts and then recursively produce new memory using previous memory and following contexts. Finally, the chatbot can easily generate a highly consistent response with the help of the latest memory. We evaluate our method on both open and closed LLMs, and the experiments on the widely-used public dataset show that our method can generate more consistent responses in a long-context conversation. Also, we show that our strategy could nicely complement both long-context (e.g., 8K and 16K) and retrieval-enhanced LLMs, bringing further long-term dialogue performance. Notably, our method is a potential solution to enable the LLM to model the extremely long context. The code and scripts will be released later.

Abstract: With the advent of modern AI architectures, a shift has happened towards end-to-end architectures. This pivot has led to neural architectures being trained without domain-specific biases/knowledge, optimized according to the task. We in this paper, learn audio embeddings via diverse feature representations, in this case, domain-specific. For the case of audio classification over hundreds of categories of sound, we learn robust separate embeddings for diverse audio properties such as pitch, timbre, and neural representation, along with also learning it via an end-to-end architecture. We observe handcrafted embeddings, e.g., pitch and timbre-based, although on their own, are not able to beat a fully end-to-end representation, yet adding these together with end-to-end embedding helps us, significantly improve performance. This work would pave the way to bring some domain expertise with end-to-end models to learn robust, diverse representations, surpassing the performance of just training end-to-end models.

Abstract: What does it take to build mobile manipulation systems that can competently operate on previously unseen objects in previously unseen environments? This work answers this question using opening of articulated structures as a mobile manipulation testbed. Specifically, our focus is on the end-to-end performance on this task without any privileged information, i.e. the robot starts at a location with the novel target articulated object in view, and has to approach the object and successfully open it. We first develop a system for this task, and then conduct 100+ end-to-end system tests across 13 real world test sites. Our large-scale study reveals a number of surprising findings: a) modular systems outperform end-to-end learned systems for this task, even when the end-to-end learned systems are trained on 1000+ demonstrations, b) perception, and not precise end-effector control, is the primary bottleneck to task success, and c) state-of-the-art articulation parameter estimation models developed in isolation struggle when faced with robot-centric viewpoints. Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of developing components of the pipeline in isolation and underscore the need for system-level research, providing a pragmatic roadmap for building generalizable mobile manipulation systems. Videos, code, and models are available on the project website: https://arjung128.github.io/opening-articulated-structures/

Abstract: Humans can often quickly and efficiently solve complex new learning tasks given only a small set of examples. In contrast, modern artificially intelligent systems often require thousands or millions of observations in order to solve even the most basic tasks. Meta-learning aims to resolve this issue by leveraging past experiences from similar learning tasks to embed the appropriate inductive biases into the learning system. Historically methods for meta-learning components such as optimizers, parameter initializations, and more have led to significant performance increases. This thesis aims to explore the concept of meta-learning to improve performance, through the often-overlooked component of the loss function. The loss function is a vital component of a learning system, as it represents the primary learning objective, where success is determined and quantified by the system's ability to optimize for that objective successfully.

Abstract: This paper presents question-answering on dense video events, a novel task that answers and grounds dense-event questions in long videos, thus challenging MLLMs to faithfully comprehend and reason about multiple events over extended periods of time. To facilitate the study, we construct DeVE-QA -- a dataset featuring 78K questions about 26K events on 10.6K long videos. Our benchmarking shows that state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle on DeVE-QA. For improvement, we propose DeVi, a novel training-free MLLM approach that highlights a hierarchical captioning module, a temporal event memory module, and a self-consistency checking module to respectively detect, contextualize and memorize, and ground dense-events in long videos for question answering. Extensive experiments show that DeVi is superior at answering dense-event questions and grounding relevant video moments. Compared with existing MLLMs, it achieves a remarkable increase of 4.8% and 2.1% for G(round)QA accuracy on DeVE-QA~and NExT-GQA, respectively. Our data and code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been successfully applied to a wide range of robotics applications for learning complex multi-modal behaviors from data. However, prior works have mostly been confined to single-robot and small-scale environments due to the high sample complexity of learning multi-robot diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a method for generating collision-free multi-robot trajectories that conform to underlying data distributions while using only single-robot data. Our algorithm, Multi-robot Multi-model planning Diffusion (MMD), does so by combining learned diffusion models with classical search-based techniques -- generating data-driven motions under collision constraints. Scaling further, we show how to compose multiple diffusion models to plan in large environments where a single diffusion model fails to generalize well. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning for dozens of robots in a variety of simulated scenarios motivated by logistics environments.

Abstract: We address an inverse problem in modeling holographic superconductors. We focus our research on the critical temperature behavior depicted by experiments. We use a physics-informed neural network method to find a mass function $M(F^2)$, which is necessary to understand phase transition behavior. This mass function describes a nonlinear interaction between superconducting order and charge carrier density. We introduce positional embedding layers to improve the learning process in our algorithm, and the Adam optimization is used to predict the critical temperature data via holographic calculation with appropriate accuracy. Consideration of the positional embedding layers is motivated by the transformer model of natural-language processing in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. We obtain holographic models that reproduce borderlines of the normal and superconducting phases provided by actual data. Our work is the first holographic attempt to match phase transition data quantitatively obtained from experiments. Also, the present work offers a new methodology for data-based holographic models.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered to have enormous potential in the future development of Artificial Intelligence due to their brain-inspired and energy-efficient properties. Compared to vanilla Spatial-Temporal Back-propagation (STBP) training methods, online training can effectively overcome the risk of GPU memory explosion. However, current online learning framework cannot tackle the inseparability problem of temporal dependent gradients and merely aim to optimize the training memory, resulting in no performance advantages compared to the STBP training models in the inference phase. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Hybrid Mechanism-Driven Firing (HM-DF) model, which is a family of advanced models that respectively adopt different spiking calculation schemes in the upper-region and lower-region of the firing threshold. We point out that HM-DF model can effectively separate temporal gradients and tackle the mismatch problem of surrogate gradients, as well as achieving full-stage optimization towards computation speed and memory footprint. Experimental results have demonstrated that HM-DF model can be flexibly combined with various techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the field of online learning, without triggering further power consumption.

<title>DeMuVGN: Effective Software Defect Prediction Model by Learning Multi-view Software Dependency via Graph Neural Networks</title>

arXiv:2410.19550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software defect prediction (SDP) aims to identify high-risk defect modules in software development, optimizing resource allocation. While previous studies show that dependency network metrics improve defect prediction, most methods focus on code-based dependency graphs, overlooking developer factors. Current metrics, based on handcrafted features like ego and global network metrics, fail to fully capture defect-related information. To address this, we propose DeMuVGN, a defect prediction model that learns multi-view software dependency via graph neural networks. We introduce a Multi-view Software Dependency Graph (MSDG) that integrates data, call, and developer dependencies. DeMuVGN also leverages the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance and enhance defect module identification. In a case study of eight open-source projects across 20 versions, DeMuVGN demonstrates significant improvements: i) models based on multi-view graphs improve F1 scores by 11.1% to 12.1% over single-view models; ii) DeMuVGN improves F1 scores by 17.4% to 45.8% in within-project contexts and by 17.9% to 41.0% in cross-project contexts. Additionally, DeMuVGN excels in software evolution, showing more improvement in later-stage software versions. Its strong performance across different projects highlights its generalizability. We recommend future research focus on multi-view dependency graphs for defect prediction in both mature and newly developed projects.

Abstract: In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable interest in the field of time series analysis, due to their ability to capture dependencies among variables and across time points. The objective of the presented systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and over 150 journal papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive collection of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of the results of current spatio-temporal GNN models in different domains. In addition, in its final part this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability.

Abstract: We introduce new high-resolution galaxy simulations accelerated by a surrogate model that reduces the computation cost by approximately 75 percent. Massive stars with a Zero Age Main Sequence mass of more than about 10 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which play a critical role in galaxy formation. The energy released by CCSNe is essential for regulating star formation and driving feedback processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the short integration timesteps required for SNe feedback have presented significant bottlenecks in astrophysical simulations across various scales. Overcoming this challenge is crucial for enabling star-by-star galaxy simulations, which aim to capture the dynamics of individual stars and the inhomogeneous shell's expansion within the turbulent ISM. To address this, our new framework combines direct numerical simulations and surrogate modeling, including machine learning and Gibbs sampling. The star formation history and the time evolution of outflow rates in the galaxy match those obtained from resolved direct numerical simulations. Our new approach achieves high-resolution fidelity while reducing computational costs, effectively bridging the physical scale gap and enabling multi-scale simulations.

Abstract: Electronic maps consist of diverse entities, such as points of interest (POIs), road networks, and land parcels, playing a vital role in applications like ITS and LBS. Map entity representation learning (MapRL) generates versatile and reusable data representations, providing essential tools for efficiently managing and utilizing map entity data. Despite the progress in MapRL, two key challenges constrain further development. First, existing research is fragmented, with models classified by the type of map entity, limiting the reusability of techniques across different tasks. Second, the lack of unified benchmarks makes systematic evaluation and comparison of models difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a novel taxonomy for MapRL that organizes models based on functional module-such as encoders, pre-training tasks, and downstream tasks-rather than by entity type. Building on this taxonomy, we present a taxonomy-driven library, VecCity, which offers easy-to-use interfaces for encoding, pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation. The library integrates datasets from nine cities and reproduces 21 mainstream MapRL models, establishing the first standardized benchmarks for the field. VecCity also allows users to modify and extend models through modular components, facilitating seamless experimentation. Our comprehensive experiments cover multiple types of map entities and evaluate 21 VecCity pre-built models across various downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of VecCity in streamlining model development and provide insights into the impact of various components on performance. By promoting modular design and reusability, VecCity offers a unified framework to advance research and innovation in MapRL. The code is available at https://github.com/Bigscity-VecCity/VecCity.

arXiv:2411.05261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in automated report generation, the opaqueness of text interpretability continues to cast doubt on the reliability of the content produced. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify specific image features in X-ray images that influence the outputs of report generation models. Specifically, we propose Cyclic Vision-Language Manipulator CVLM, a module to generate a manipulated X-ray from an original X-ray and its report from a designated report generator. The essence of CVLM is that cycling manipulated X-rays to the report generator produces altered reports aligned with the alterations pre-injected into the reports for X-ray generation, achieving the term "cyclic manipulation". This process allows direct comparison between original and manipulated X-rays, clarifying the critical image features driving changes in reports and enabling model users to assess the reliability of the generated texts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CVLM can identify more precise and reliable features compared to existing explanation methods, significantly enhancing the transparency and applicability of AI-generated reports.

Abstract: Accurate photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting is critical for integrating renewable energy sources into the grid, optimizing real-time energy management, and ensuring energy reliability amidst increasing demand. However, existing models often struggle with effectively capturing the complex relationships between target variables and covariates, as well as the interactions between temporal dynamics and multivariate data, leading to suboptimal forecasting accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model architecture that leverages the iTransformer for feature extraction from target variables and employs long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract features from covariates. A cross-attention mechanism is integrated to fuse the outputs of both models, followed by a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) mapping for enhanced representation. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated using publicly available datasets from Australia, with experiments conducted across four seasons. Results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively capture seasonal variations in PV power generation and improve forecasting accuracy.

<title>SceneLLM: Implicit Language Reasoning in LLM for Dynamic Scene Graph Generation</title>

Abstract: Dynamic scenes contain intricate spatio-temporal information, crucial for mobile robots, UAVs, and autonomous driving systems to make informed decisions. Parsing these scenes into semantic triplets  for accurate Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is highly challenging due to the fluctuating spatio-temporal complexity. Inspired by the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose SceneLLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as powerful scene analyzers for dynamic SGG. Our framework introduces a Video-to-Language (V2L) mapping module that transforms video frames into linguistic signals (scene tokens), making the input more comprehensible for LLMs. To better encode spatial information, we devise a Spatial Information Aggregation (SIA) scheme, inspired by the structure of Chinese characters, which encodes spatial data into tokens. Using Optimal Transport (OT), we generate an implicit language signal from the frame-level token sequence that captures the video's spatio-temporal information. To further improve the LLM's ability to process this implicit linguistic input, we apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model. Finally, we use a transformer-based SGG predictor to decode the LLM's reasoning and predict semantic triplets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Action Genome (AG) benchmark, and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of SceneLLM in understanding and generating accurate dynamic scene graphs.

<title>Vision-Language Model Selection and Reuse for Downstream Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly popular across various visual tasks, and several open-sourced VLM variants have been released. However, selecting the best-performing pre-trained VLM for a specific downstream task is challenging since no single VLM can achieve promising performance on all downstream tasks, and evaluating all available VLMs is impossible due to time and data limitations. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel paradigm to select and reuse VLM for downstream tasks, called Model Label Learning (MLL). The proposal contains three key modules: \emph{model labeling}, which assigns labels to each VLM to describe their specialty and utility; \emph{model selection}, which matches the requirements of the target task with model labels; and \emph{model reuse}, which applies selected VLMs to the target task in an ensemble manner. The proposal is highly computationally efficient and growable since the model labeling process is completed target task independent and the ability could grow with the number of candidate VLMs. We also introduce a new benchmark for evaluating VLM selection methods, including 49 VLMs and 17 target task datasets. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for selecting and reusing VLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) image recognition is a powerful tool for extracting data from images, but accuracy depends on providing sufficient cues in the prompt - requiring a domain expert for specialized tasks. We introduce Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition (CLEAR), which uses a combination of LLMs and evolutionary computation to generate and optimize cues such that recognition of specialized features in images is improved. It achieves this by auto-generating a novel domain-specific representation and then using it to optimize suitable textual cues with a genetic algorithm. We apply CLEAR to the real-world task of identifying sustainability data from interior and exterior images of buildings. We investigate the effects of using a variable-length representation compared to fixed-length and show how LLM consistency can be improved by refactoring from categorical to real-valued estimates. We show that CLEAR enables higher accuracy compared to expert human recognition and human-authored prompts in every task with error rates improved by up to two orders of magnitude and an ablation study evincing solution concision.

Abstract: Sustainable agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring world food security for consumers. A critical challenge faced by sustainable precision agriculture is weed growth, as weeds compete for essential resources with crops, such as water, soil nutrients, and sunlight, which notably affect crop yields. The adoption of automated computer vision technologies and ground agricultural consumer electronic vehicles in precision agriculture offers sustainable, low-carbon solutions. However, prior works suffer from issues such as low accuracy and precision, as well as high computational expense. This work proposes EcoWeedNet, a novel model that enhances weed detection performance without introducing significant computational complexity, aligning with the goals of low-carbon agricultural practices. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on the CottonWeedDet12 benchmark dataset, which reflects real-world scenarios. EcoWeedNet achieves performance comparable to that of large models (mAP@0.5 = 95.2%), yet with significantly fewer parameters (approximately 4.21% of the parameters of YOLOv4), lower computational complexity and better computational efficiency 6.59% of the GFLOPs of YOLOv4). These key findings indicate EcoWeedNet's deployability on low-power consumer hardware, lower energy consumption, and hence reduced carbon footprint, thereby emphasizing the application prospects of EcoWeedNet in next-generation sustainable agriculture. These findings provide the way forward for increased application of environmentally-friendly agricultural consumer technologies.

Abstract: Over the past few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly and are widely applied in various domains. However, LLMs face the issue of hallucinations, generating responses that may be unreliable when the models lack relevant knowledge. To be aware of potential hallucinations, uncertainty estimation methods have been introduced, and most of them have confirmed that reliability lies in critical tokens. However, probability-based methods perform poorly in identifying token reliability, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we reveal that the probability-based method fails to estimate token reliability due to the loss of evidence strength information which is accumulated in the training stage. Therefore, we present Logits-induced token uncertainty (LogTokU), a framework for estimating decoupled token uncertainty in LLMs, enabling real-time uncertainty estimation without requiring multiple sampling processes. We employ evidence modeling to implement LogTokU and use the estimated uncertainty to guide downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that LogTokU has significant effectiveness and promise.

Abstract: We present a tool for enhancing the detail of physically based materials using an off-the-shelf diffusion model and inverse rendering. Our goal is to enhance the visual fidelity of materials with detail that is often tedious to author, by adding signs of wear, aging, weathering, etc. As these appearance details are often rooted in real-world processes, we leverage a generative image model trained on a large dataset of natural images with corresponding visuals in context. Starting with a given geometry, UV mapping, and basic appearance, we render multiple views of the object. We use these views, together with an appearance-defining text prompt, to condition a diffusion model. The details it generates are then backpropagated from the enhanced images to the material parameters via inverse differentiable rendering. For inverse rendering to be successful, the generated appearance has to be consistent across all the images. We propose two priors to address the multi-view consistency of the diffusion model. First, we ensure that the initial noise that seeds the diffusion process is itself consistent across views by integrating it from a view-independent UV space. Second, we enforce geometric consistency by biasing the attention mechanism via a projective constraint so that pixels attend strongly to their corresponding pixel locations in other views. Our approach does not require any training or finetuning of the diffusion model, is agnostic of the material model used, and the enhanced material properties, i.e., 2D PBR textures, can be further edited by artists.

<title>Liger: Linearizing Large Language Models to Gated Recurrent Structures</title>

Abstract: Transformers with linear recurrent modeling offer linear-time training and constant-memory inference. Despite their demonstrated efficiency and performance, pretraining such non-standard architectures from scratch remains costly and risky. The linearization of large language models (LLMs) transforms pretrained standard models into linear recurrent structures, enabling more efficient deployment. However, current linearization methods typically introduce additional feature map modules that require extensive fine-tuning and overlook the gating mechanisms used in state-of-the-art linear recurrent models. To address these issues, this paper presents Liger, short for Linearizing LLMs to gated recurrent structures. Liger is a novel approach for converting pretrained LLMs into gated linear recurrent models without adding extra parameters. It repurposes the pretrained key matrix weights to construct diverse gating mechanisms, facilitating the formation of various gated recurrent structures while avoiding the need to train additional components from scratch. Using lightweight fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Liger restores the performance of the linearized gated recurrent models to match that of the original LLMs. Additionally, we introduce Liger Attention, an intra-layer hybrid attention mechanism, which significantly recovers 93\% of the Transformer-based LLM at 0.02\% pre-training tokens during the linearization process, achieving competitive results across multiple benchmarks, as validated on models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters. Code is available at https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Linearization.

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks, we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Code: https://github.com/cspartalis/LoTUS.

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can naturally emerge through a simple reinforcement learning (RL) framework with rule-based rewards, where the training may directly start from the base models-a paradigm referred to as zero RL training. Most recent efforts to reproduce zero RL training have primarily focused on the Qwen2.5 model series, which may not be representative as we find the base models already exhibit strong instruction-following and self-reflection abilities. In this work, we investigate zero RL training across 10 diverse base models, spanning different families and sizes including LLama3-8B, Mistral-7B/24B, DeepSeek-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-math-7B, and all Qwen2.5 models from 0.5B to 32B. Leveraging several key design strategies-such as adjusting format reward and controlling query difficulty-we achieve substantial improvements in both reasoning accuracy and response length across most settings. However, by carefully monitoring the training dynamics, we observe that different base models exhibit distinct patterns during training. For instance, the increased response length does not always correlate with the emergence of certain cognitive behaviors such as verification (i.e., the "aha moment"). Notably, we observe the "aha moment" for the first time in small models not from the Qwen family. We share the key designs that enable successful zero RL training, along with our findings and practices. To facilitate further research, we open-source the code, models, and analysis tools.

Abstract: The Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem (STSP) is a variant of the classical Traveling Salesman Problem. The STSP involves incorporating steiner nodes, which are extra nodes not originally part of the required visit set but that can be added to the route to enhance the overall solution and minimize the total travel cost. Given the NP-hard nature of the STSP, we propose a quantum approach to address it. Specifically, we employ quantum annealing using D-Wave's hardware to explore its potential for solving this problem. To enhance computational feasibility, we develop a preprocessing method that effectively reduces the network size. Our experimental results demonstrate that this reduction technique significantly decreases the problem complexity, making the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation, the standard input for quantum annealers, better suited for existing quantum hardware. Furthermore, the results highlight the potential of quantum annealing as a promising and innovative approach for solving the STSP.

Abstract: Federated Active Learning (FAL) has emerged as a promising framework to leverage large quantities of unlabeled data across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, real-world deployments remain limited by high annotation costs and communication-intensive sampling processes, particularly in a cross-silo setting, when clients possess substantial local datasets. This paper addresses the crucial question: What is the best practice to reduce communication costs in human-in-the-loop learning with minimal annotator effort? Existing FAL methods typically rely on iterative annotation processes that separate active sampling from federated updates, leading to multiple rounds of expensive communication and annotation. In response, we introduce FAST, a two-pass FAL framework that harnesses foundation models for weak labeling in a preliminary pass, followed by a refinement pass focused exclusively on the most uncertain samples. By leveraging representation knowledge from foundation models and integrating refinement steps into a streamlined workflow, FAST substantially reduces the overhead incurred by iterative active sampling. Extensive experiments on diverse medical and natural image benchmarks demonstrate that FAST outperforms existing FAL methods by an average of 4.36% while reducing communication rounds eightfold under a limited 5% labeling budget.

Abstract: Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of interrelated risk factors that significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. Despite its global prevalence, accurate prediction of MetS remains challenging due to issues such as class imbalance, data scarcity, and methodological inconsistencies in existing studies. In this paper, we address these challenges by systematically evaluating and optimizing machine learning (ML) models for MetS prediction, leveraging advanced data balancing techniques and counterfactual analysis. Multiple ML models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, TabNet, etc., were trained and compared under various data balancing techniques such as random oversampling (ROS), SMOTE, ADASYN, and CTGAN. Additionally, we introduce MetaBoost, a novel hybrid framework that integrates SMOTE, ADASYN, and CTGAN, optimizing synthetic data generation through weighted averaging and iterative weight tuning to enhance the model's performance (achieving up to a 1.87% accuracy improvement over individual balancing techniques). A comprehensive counterfactual analysis is conducted to quantify the feature-level changes required to shift individuals from high-risk to low-risk categories. The results indicate that blood glucose (50.3%) and triglycerides (46.7%) were the most frequently modified features, highlighting their clinical significance in MetS risk reduction. Additionally, probabilistic analysis shows elevated blood glucose (85.5% likelihood) and triglycerides (74.9% posterior probability) as the strongest predictors. This study not only advances the methodological rigor of MetS prediction but also provides actionable insights for clinicians and researchers, highlighting the potential of ML in mitigating the public health burden of metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: The loss landscape of Variational Quantum Neural Networks (VQNNs) is characterized by local minima that grow exponentially with increasing qubits. Because of this, it is more challenging to recover information from model gradients during training compared to classical Neural Networks (NNs). In this paper we present a numerical scheme that successfully reconstructs input training, real-world, practical data from trainable VQNNs' gradients. Our scheme is based on gradient inversion that works by combining gradients estimation with the finite difference method and adaptive low-pass filtering. The scheme is further optimized with Kalman filter to obtain efficient convergence. Our experiments show that our algorithm can invert even batch-trained data, given the VQNN model is sufficiently over-parameterized.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important part of our everyday lives, yet user requirements for designing AI-assisted systems in law enforcement remain unclear. To address this gap, we conducted qualitative research on decision-making within a law enforcement agency. Our study aimed to identify limitations of existing practices, explore user requirements and understand the responsibilities that humans expect to undertake in these systems.
  Participants in our study highlighted the need for a system capable of processing and analysing large volumes of data efficiently to help in crime detection and prevention. Additionally, the system should satisfy requirements for scalability, accuracy, justification, trustworthiness and adaptability to be adopted in this domain. Participants also emphasised the importance of having end users review the input data that might be challenging for AI to interpret, and validate the generated output to ensure the system's accuracy. To keep up with the evolving nature of the law enforcement domain, end users need to help the system adapt to the changes in criminal behaviour and government guidance, and technical experts need to regularly oversee and monitor the system. Furthermore, user-friendly human interaction with the system is essential for its adoption and some of the participants confirmed they would be happy to be in the loop and provide necessary feedback that the system can learn from. Finally, we argue that it is very unlikely that the system will ever achieve full automation due to the dynamic and complex nature of the law enforcement domain.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) as their foundational reasoning engine, are transforming clinical workflows such as medical report generation and clinical summarization by autonomously analyzing sensitive healthcare data and executing decisions with minimal human oversight. However, their adoption demands strict compliance with regulatory frameworks such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), particularly when handling Protected Health Information (PHI). This work-in-progress paper introduces a HIPAA-compliant Agentic AI framework that enforces regulatory compliance through dynamic, context-aware policy enforcement. Our framework integrates three core mechanisms: (1) Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for granular PHI governance, (2) a hybrid PHI sanitization pipeline combining regex patterns and BERT-based model to minimize leakage, and (3) immutable audit trails for compliance verification.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of large language models (LLMs), enabling them to perform new tasks based on a few provided examples without explicit fine-tuning. Despite their impressive adaptability, these models remain vulnerable to subtle adversarial perturbations and exhibit unpredictable behavior when faced with linguistic variations. Inspired by software testing principles, we introduce a software testing-inspired framework, called MMT4NL, for evaluating the trustworthiness of in-context learning by utilizing adversarial perturbations and software testing techniques. It includes diverse evaluation aspects of linguistic capabilities for testing the ICL capabilities of LLMs. MMT4NL is built around the idea of crafting metamorphic adversarial examples from a test set in order to quantify and pinpoint bugs in the designed prompts of ICL. Our philosophy is to treat any LLM as software and validate its functionalities just like testing the software. Finally, we demonstrate applications of MMT4NL on the sentiment analysis and question-answering tasks. Our experiments could reveal various linguistic bugs in state-of-the-art LLMs.

Abstract: With the advance of large language models (LLMs), LLMs have been utilized for the various tasks. However, the issues of variability and reproducibility of results from each trial of LLMs have been largely overlooked in existing literature while actual human annotation uses majority voting to resolve disagreements among annotators. Therefore, this study introduces the straightforward ensemble strategy to a sentiment analysis using LLMs. As the results, we demonstrate that the ensemble of multiple inference using medium-sized LLMs produces more robust and accurate results than using a large model with a single attempt with reducing RMSE by 18.6%.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved great success in numerous NLP tasks but continue to exhibit notable gaps in multi-step factual reasoning, especially when real-world knowledge is sparse. Recent advances in grokking have demonstrated that neural networks can transition from memorizing to perfectly generalizing once they detect underlying logical patterns - yet these studies have primarily used small, synthetic tasks. In this paper, for the first time, we extend grokking to real-world factual data and address the challenge of dataset sparsity by augmenting existing knowledge graphs with carefully designed synthetic data to raise the ratio $\phi_r$ of inferred facts to atomic facts above the threshold required for grokking. Surprisingly, we find that even factually incorrect synthetic data can strengthen emergent reasoning circuits rather than degrade accuracy, as it forces the model to rely on relational structure rather than memorization. When evaluated on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, our approach achieves up to 95-100% accuracy on 2WikiMultiHopQA - substantially improving over strong baselines and matching or exceeding current state-of-the-art results. We further provide an in-depth analysis of how increasing $\phi_r$ drives the formation of generalizing circuits inside Transformers. Our findings suggest that grokking-based data augmentation can unlock implicit multi-hop reasoning capabilities, opening the door to more robust and interpretable factual reasoning in large-scale language models.

Abstract: Generative AI systems have revolutionized human interaction by enabling natural language-based coding and problem solving. However, the inherent ambiguity of natural language often leads to imprecise instructions, forcing users to iteratively test, correct, and resubmit their prompts. We propose an iterative approach that systematically narrows down these ambiguities through a structured series of clarification questions and alternative solution proposals, illustrated with input/output examples as well. Once every uncertainty is resolved, a final, precise solution is generated. Evaluated on a diverse dataset spanning coding, data analysis, and creative writing, our method demonstrates superior accuracy, competitive resolution times, and higher user satisfaction compared to conventional one-shot solutions, which typically require multiple manual iterations to achieve a correct output.

Abstract: Multimodal learning, which integrates diverse data sources such as images, text, and structured data, has proven superior to unimodal counterparts in high-stakes decision-making. However, while performance gains remain the gold standard for evaluating multimodal systems, concerns around bias and robustness are frequently overlooked. In this context, this paper explores two key research questions (RQs): (i) RQ1 examines whether adding a modality con-sistently enhances performance and investigates its role in shaping fairness measures, assessing whether it mitigates or amplifies bias in multimodal models; (ii) RQ2 investigates the impact of missing modalities at inference time, analyzing how multimodal models generalize in terms of both performance and fairness. Our analysis reveals that incorporating new modalities during training consistently enhances the performance of multimodal models, while fairness trends exhibit variability across different evaluation measures and datasets. Additionally, the absence of modalities at inference degrades performance and fairness, raising concerns about its robustness in real-world deployment. We conduct extensive experiments using multimodal healthcare datasets containing images, time series, and structured information to validate our findings.

Summary:<br /><br />In this new article, the focus is on addressing the struggle of independent learners in maintaining focus and emotional regulation. The research introduces an AI-powered system that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to create personalized multisensory study environments. Users can customize visual themes and auditory elements to reduce distractions and enhance emotional stability. The primary research question explores how personalized audiovisual elements impact learner cognitive load and engagement. A mixed-methods design incorporating biometric measures and performance outcomes will evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-driven sensory personalization. The aim is to advance emotionally responsive educational technologies by utilizing the powerful multimodal capabilities of LLMs in the sensory dimension of self-directed learning. <div>

Abstract: Independent learners often struggle with sustaining focus and emotional regulation in unstructured or distracting settings. Although some rely on ambient aids such as music, ASMR, or visual backgrounds to support concentration, these tools are rarely integrated into cohesive, learner-centered systems. Moreover, existing educational technologies focus primarily on content adaptation and feedback, overlooking the emotional and sensory context in which learning takes place. Large language models have demonstrated powerful multimodal capabilities including the ability to generate and adapt text, audio, and visual content. Educational research has yet to fully explore their potential in creating personalized audiovisual learning environments. To address this gap, we introduce an AI-powered system that uses LLMs to generate personalized multisensory study environments. Users select or generate customized visual themes (e.g., abstract vs. realistic, static vs. animated) and auditory elements (e.g., white noise, ambient ASMR, familiar vs. novel sounds) to create immersive settings aimed at reducing distraction and enhancing emotional stability. Our primary research question investigates how combinations of personalized audiovisual elements affect learner cognitive load and engagement. Using a mixed-methods design that incorporates biometric measures and performance outcomes, this study evaluates the effectiveness of LLM-driven sensory personalization. The findings aim to advance emotionally responsive educational technologies and extend the application of multimodal LLMs into the sensory dimension of self-directed learning.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Brutally Long Audio Bench (BLAB), a benchmark for evaluating audio language models (LMs) on tasks including localization, duration estimation, emotion, and counting using long-form audio clips averaging 51 minutes. The study evaluates six audio LMs on BLAB and finds that even advanced models struggle with the tasks. Performance declines as audio duration increases, particularly in tasks like localization, temporal reasoning, and counting. The models rely heavily on prompts rather than audio content and have difficulty understanding non-phonemic information. BLAB highlights the challenges in developing audio LMs with robust long-form audio understanding capabilities, providing insights into the trade-offs between task difficulty and audio duration. <div>
arXiv:2505.03054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing large audio language models (LMs) capable of understanding diverse spoken interactions is essential for accommodating the multimodal nature of human communication and can increase the accessibility of language technologies across different user populations. Recent work on audio LMs has primarily evaluated their performance on short audio segments, typically under 30 seconds, with limited exploration of long-form conversational speech segments that more closely reflect natural user interactions with these models. We introduce Brutally Long Audio Bench (BLAB), a challenging long-form audio benchmark that evaluates audio LMs on localization, duration estimation, emotion, and counting tasks using audio segments averaging 51 minutes in length. BLAB consists of 833+ hours of diverse, full-length audio clips, each paired with human-annotated, text-based natural language questions and answers. Our audio data were collected from permissively licensed sources and underwent a human-assisted filtering process to ensure task compliance. We evaluate six open-source and proprietary audio LMs on BLAB and find that all of them, including advanced models such as Gemini 2.0 Pro and GPT-4o, struggle with the tasks in BLAB. Our comprehensive analysis reveals key insights into the trade-offs between task difficulty and audio duration. In general, we find that audio LMs struggle with long-form speech, with performance declining as duration increases. They perform poorly on localization, temporal reasoning, counting, and struggle to understand non-phonemic information, relying more on prompts than audio content. BLAB serves as a challenging evaluation framework to develop audio LMs with robust long-form audio understanding capabilities.

<div> deep learning, oyster monitoring, image analysis, prediction error, image quality

Summary: 
The study focused on using the ODYSSEE model, based on deep learning techniques, to identify live oysters in reef images for population monitoring. The model was faster than human annotators but had lower accuracy in identifying live oysters. Image quality was found to be crucial for both the model and annotators, with better quality images improving human accuracy but worsening model accuracy. Future improvements in the model could include training on higher-quality images, using more live imagery, and adding additional annotation training classes. The research also highlighted the need for better methods to differentiate between living and dead oysters in monitoring efforts.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oysters are ecologically and commercially important species that require frequent monitoring to track population demographics (e.g. abundance, growth, mortality). Current methods of monitoring oyster reefs often require destructive sampling methods and extensive manual effort. Therefore, they are suboptimal for small-scale or sensitive environments. A recent alternative, the ODYSSEE model, was developed to use deep learning techniques to identify live oysters using video or images taken in the field of oyster reefs to assess abundance. The validity of this model in identifying live oysters on a reef was compared to expert and non-expert annotators. In addition, we identified potential sources of prediction error. Although the model can make inferences significantly faster than expert and non-expert annotators (39.6 s, $2.34 \pm 0.61$ h, $4.50 \pm 1.46$ h, respectively), the model overpredicted the number of live oysters, achieving lower accuracy (63\%) in identifying live oysters compared to experts (74\%) and non-experts (75\%) alike. Image quality was an important factor in determining the accuracy of the model and the annotators. Better quality images improved human accuracy and worsened model accuracy. Although ODYSSEE was not sufficiently accurate, we anticipate that future training on higher-quality images, utilizing additional live imagery, and incorporating additional annotation training classes will greatly improve the model's predictive power based on the results of this analysis. Future research should address methods that improve the detection of living vs. dead oysters.

<div> Keywords: Internet connectivity, disinformation detection, Large Language Models (LLMs), evidence retrieval, fact-checking 

Summary: 
The study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated disinformation detection in the age of widespread Internet connectivity. Traditional deep learning models struggle to handle the complexity of multimodal disinformation, but LLMs show promise when provided with relevant evidence. However, LLMs are unable to autonomously search for accurate evidence. To address this limitation, the Holmes framework is proposed, which incorporates a novel evidence retrieval method. This method combines LLM-powered summarization to extract key information from open sources with a new algorithm and metrics to evaluate evidence quality. The framework enables LLMs to verify claims and generate justifications effectively, leading to improved fact-checking accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Holmes achieves high accuracy rates on both open-source datasets and real-time verification tasks, with a significant boost in fact-checking accuracy compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The rise of Internet connectivity has accelerated the spread of disinformation, threatening societal trust, decision-making, and national security. Disinformation has evolved from simple text to complex multimodal forms combining images and text, challenging existing detection methods. Traditional deep learning models struggle to capture the complexity of multimodal disinformation. Inspired by advances in AI, this study explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated disinformation detection. The empirical study shows that (1) LLMs alone cannot reliably assess the truthfulness of claims; (2) providing relevant evidence significantly improves their performance; (3) however, LLMs cannot autonomously search for accurate evidence. To address this, we propose Holmes, an end-to-end framework featuring a novel evidence retrieval method that assists LLMs in collecting high-quality evidence. Our approach uses (1) LLM-powered summarization to extract key information from open sources and (2) a new algorithm and metrics to evaluate evidence quality. Holmes enables LLMs to verify claims and generate justifications effectively. Experiments show Holmes achieves 88.3% accuracy on two open-source datasets and 90.2% in real-time verification tasks. Notably, our improved evidence retrieval boosts fact-checking accuracy by 30.8% over existing methods

Summary:   
CombiBench introduces a new benchmark dataset consisting of 100 combinatorial problems formalized in Lean 4 and covering various difficulty levels and topics. It includes all IMO combinatorial problems since 2000, except for one. The Fine-Eval evaluation framework is proposed for formal mathematics, including fill-in-the-blank questions. When benchmarking several large language models on CombiBench, it is found that their ability to formally solve combinatorial problems is limited. Among the models tested, Kimina-Prover performs the best, solving 7 out of 100 problems. The benchmark dataset and evaluation method code are open-sourced on GitHub at https://github.com/MoonshotAI/CombiBench/.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurosymbolic approaches integrating large language models with formal reasoning have recently achieved human-level performance on mathematics competition problems in algebra, geometry and number theory. In comparison, combinatorics remains a challenging domain, characterized by a lack of appropriate benchmarks and theorem libraries. To address this gap, we introduce CombiBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 100 combinatorial problems, each formalized in Lean~4 and paired with its corresponding informal statement. The problem set covers a wide spectrum of difficulty levels, ranging from middle school to IMO and university level, and span over ten combinatorial topics. CombiBench is suitable for testing IMO solving capabilities since it includes all IMO combinatorial problems since 2000 (except IMO 2004 P3 as its statement contain an images). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive and standardized evaluation framework, dubbed Fine-Eval (for $\textbf{F}$ill-in-the-blank $\textbf{in}$ L$\textbf{e}$an Evaluation), for formal mathematics. It accommodates not only proof-based problems but also, for the first time, the evaluation of fill-in-the-blank questions. Using Fine-Eval as the evaluation method and Kimina Lean Server as the backend, we benchmark several LLMs on CombiBench and observe that their capabilities for formally solving combinatorial problems remain limited. Among all models tested (none of which has been trained for this particular task), Kimina-Prover attains the best results, solving 7 problems (out of 100) under both ``with solution'' and ``without solution'' scenarios. We open source the benchmark dataset alongside with the code of the proposed evaluation method at https://github.com/MoonshotAI/CombiBench/.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, contrastive activation engineering, in-distribution settings, adversarial inputs, model perplexity

Summary:
CAE techniques offer a promising method for steering the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) through targeted modifications to their internal representations. However, the effectiveness of CAE is limited to in-distribution contexts and may result in diminishing returns beyond 80 samples for generating steering vectors. Additionally, CAE may be susceptible to adversarial inputs that reverse the desired behavior modification and can harm the overall model perplexity. Despite these drawbacks, larger LLMs exhibit greater resilience to steering-induced degradation. As such, while CAE presents a novel approach to task-specific behavior tuning of LLMs at zero cost during inference, careful consideration must be given to its application to ensure optimal performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
CAE techniques provide a method for steering Large Language Models' behavior through targeted modifications but are effective only in in-distribution contexts. Generating steering vectors with more than 80 samples offers diminishing returns, and the approach is vulnerable to adversarial inputs that can reverse desired behavior modifications and harm model perplexity. Larger models are more resistant to degradation caused by steering. Therefore, while CAE offers a cost-free method for task-specific behavior tuning during inference, its application requires caution to achieve optimal results. <div>
arXiv:2505.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge due to their inherent complexity and opacity. While techniques like fine-tuning can modify model behavior, they typically require extensive computational resources. Recent work has introduced a class of contrastive activation engineering (CAE) techniques as promising approaches for steering LLM outputs through targeted modifications to their internal representations. Applied at inference-time with zero cost, CAE has the potential to introduce a new paradigm of flexible, task-specific LLM behavior tuning. We analyze the performance of CAE in in-distribution, out-of-distribution settings, evaluate drawbacks, and begin to develop comprehensive guidelines for its effective deployment. We find that 1. CAE is only reliably effective when applied to in-distribution contexts. 2. Increasing the number of samples used to generate steering vectors has diminishing returns at around 80 samples. 3. Steering vectors are susceptible to adversarial inputs that reverses the behavior that is steered for. 4. Steering vectors harm the overall model perplexity. 5. Larger models are more resistant to steering-induced degradation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to effectively utilize a growing number of external tools, such as those defined by the Model Context Protocol (MCP)\cite{IntroducingMCP}, due to prompt bloat and selection complexity. We introduce RAG-MCP, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that overcomes this challenge by offloading tool discovery. RAG-MCP uses semantic retrieval to identify the most relevant MCP(s) for a given query from an external index before engaging the LLM. Only the selected tool descriptions are passed to the model, drastically reducing prompt size and simplifying decision-making. Experiments, including an MCP stress test, demonstrate RAG-MCP significantly cuts prompt tokens (e.g., by over 50%) and more than triples tool selection accuracy (43.13% vs 13.62% baseline) on benchmark tasks. RAG-MCP enables scalable and accurate tool integration for LLMs.

Abstract: Modern automation systems increasingly rely on modular architectures, with capabilities and skills as one solution approach. Capabilities define the functions of resources in a machine-readable form and skills provide the concrete implementations that realize those capabilities. However, the development of a skill implementation conforming to a corresponding capability remains a time-consuming and challenging task. In this paper, we present a method that treats capabilities as contracts for skill implementations and leverages large language models to generate executable code based on natural language user input. A key feature of our approach is the integration of existing software libraries and interface technologies, enabling the generation of skill implementations across different target languages. We introduce a framework that allows users to incorporate their own libraries and resource interfaces into the code generation process through a retrieval-augmented generation architecture. The proposed method is evaluated using an autonomous mobile robot controlled via Python and ROS 2, demonstrating the feasibility and flexibility of the approach.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting human behavior has emerged as a core capability in various AI application domains such as autonomous driving, smart healthcare, surveillance systems, and social robotics. This paper defines the technical framework of Artificial Behavior Intelligence (ABI), which comprehensively analyzes and interprets human posture, facial expressions, emotions, behavioral sequences, and contextual cues. It details the essential components of ABI, including pose estimation, face and emotion recognition, sequential behavior analysis, and context-aware modeling. Furthermore, we highlight the transformative potential of recent advances in large-scale pretrained models, such as large language models (LLMs), vision foundation models, and multimodal integration models, in significantly improving the accuracy and interpretability of behavior recognition. Our research team has a strong interest in the ABI domain and is actively conducting research, particularly focusing on the development of intelligent lightweight models capable of efficiently inferring complex human behaviors. This paper identifies several technical challenges that must be addressed to deploy ABI in real-world applications including learning behavioral intelligence from limited data, quantifying uncertainty in complex behavior prediction, and optimizing model structures for low-power, real-time inference. To tackle these challenges, our team is exploring various optimization strategies including lightweight transformers, graph-based recognition architectures, energy-aware loss functions, and multimodal knowledge distillation, while validating their applicability in real-time environments.

Summary:<br /><br />Large Language Models face challenges in critically peer reviewing scientific manuscripts due to data limitations and the complexity of expert reasoning. This study introduces Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP), a methodology using standard LLM chat interfaces to guide LLMs through detailed analysis workflows for evaluating experimental chemistry manuscripts. The PWP prompt is structured hierarchically via Markdown and developed through meta-prompting techniques to codify expert review workflows. It equips LLMs with persistent workflows triggered by queries, enabling systematic evaluations. Demonstrations show PWP-guided LLMs identifying methodological flaws, mitigating input bias, and performing complex tasks like integrating text/photo/figure analysis. The work showcases the potential of PWP in enabling sophisticated analyses using LLMs for complex scientific tasks, highlighting the importance of detailed workflow formalization.

Abstract: Critical peer review of scientific manuscripts presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), partly due to data limitations and the complexity of expert reasoning. This report introduces Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP), a potentially broadly applicable prompt engineering methodology designed to bridge this gap using standard LLM chat interfaces (zero-code, no APIs). We present a proof-of-concept PWP prompt for the critical analysis of experimental chemistry manuscripts, featuring a hierarchical, modular architecture (structured via Markdown) that defines detailed analysis workflows. We develop this PWP prompt through iterative application of meta-prompting techniques and meta-reasoning aimed at systematically codifying expert review workflows, including tacit knowledge. Submitted once at the start of a session, this PWP prompt equips the LLM with persistent workflows triggered by subsequent queries, guiding modern reasoning LLMs through systematic, multimodal evaluations. Demonstrations show the PWP-guided LLM identifying major methodological flaws in a test case while mitigating LLM input bias and performing complex tasks, including distinguishing claims from evidence, integrating text/photo/figure analysis to infer parameters, executing quantitative feasibility checks, comparing estimates against claims, and assessing a priori plausibility. To ensure transparency and facilitate replication, we provide full prompts, detailed demonstration analyses, and logs of interactive chats as supplementary resources. Beyond the specific application, this work offers insights into the meta-development process itself, highlighting the potential of PWP, informed by detailed workflow formalization, to enable sophisticated analysis using readily available LLMs for complex scientific tasks.

Abstract: Speech-based AI models are emerging as powerful tools for detecting depression and the presence of Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), offering a non-invasive and cost-effective way to assess mental health. However, these models often struggle with gender bias, which can lead to unfair and inaccurate predictions. In this study, our study addresses this issue by introducing a domain adversarial training approach that explicitly considers gender differences in speech-based depression and PTSD detection. Specifically, we treat different genders as distinct domains and integrate this information into a pretrained speech foundation model. We then validate its effectiveness on the E-DAIC dataset to assess its impact on performance. Experimental results show that our method notably improves detection performance, increasing the F1-score by up to 13.29 percentage points compared to the baseline. This highlights the importance of addressing demographic disparities in AI-driven mental health assessment.

Summary: 
This study explores a new approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) and learning analytics to assess children's development during free play in early childhood education. By analyzing children's self-narratives of their play experiences, the LLM accurately identifies cognitive, motor, and social abilities with over 90% accuracy. Performance scores from different play settings reveal significant differences in developmental outcomes, highlighting the unique contributions of each area to specific abilities. The proposed approach proves effective in identifying children's development across various play settings, offering valuable insights for personalized learning and enhancing early childhood education practices. This innovative method provides comprehensive insights into children's developmental trajectories, allowing educators to support individualized learning and improve educational strategies.

Abstract: Free play is a fundamental aspect of early childhood education, supporting children's cognitive, social, emotional, and motor development. However, assessing children's development during free play poses significant challenges due to the unstructured and spontaneous nature of the activity. Traditional assessment methods often rely on direct observations by teachers, parents, or researchers, which may fail to capture comprehensive insights from free play and provide timely feedback to educators. This study proposes an innovative approach combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with learning analytics to analyze children's self-narratives of their play experiences. The LLM identifies developmental abilities, while performance scores across different play settings are calculated using learning analytics techniques. We collected 2,224 play narratives from 29 children in a kindergarten, covering four distinct play areas over one semester. According to the evaluation results from eight professionals, the LLM-based approach achieved high accuracy in identifying cognitive, motor, and social abilities, with accuracy exceeding 90% in most domains. Moreover, significant differences in developmental outcomes were observed across play settings, highlighting each area's unique contributions to specific abilities. These findings confirm that the proposed approach is effective in identifying children's development across various free play settings. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs and learning analytics to provide child-centered insights into developmental trajectories, offering educators valuable data to support personalized learning and enhance early childhood education practices.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tasks such as text generation and code completion due to their resemblance to human procedural memory. However, their limitations become apparent in complex and unpredictable environments. This paper argues that LLMs must be enhanced with semantic memory and associative learning systems to navigate such environments effectively. By adopting a modular architecture that separates these cognitive functions, a bridge can be created between procedural expertise and adaptive intelligence necessary for real-world problem-solving. The proposed approach aims to address the challenges posed by dynamic and novel learning environments, where rules are ever-changing, feedback is uncertain, and adaptability is crucial. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a landmark achievement in Artificial Intelligence (AI), demonstrating unprecedented proficiency in procedural tasks such as text generation, code completion, and conversational coherence. These capabilities stem from their architecture, which mirrors human procedural memory -- the brain's ability to automate repetitive, pattern-driven tasks through practice. However, as LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it becomes impossible to ignore their limitations operating in complex, unpredictable environments. This paper argues that LLMs, while transformative, are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on procedural memory. To create agents capable of navigating ``wicked'' learning environments -- where rules shift, feedback is ambiguous, and novelty is the norm -- we must augment LLMs with semantic memory and associative learning systems. By adopting a modular architecture that decouples these cognitive functions, we can bridge the gap between narrow procedural expertise and the adaptive intelligence required for real-world problem-solving.

Summary:  
In this study, the researchers investigate the steganographic capabilities of large language models (LLMs) that have been fine-tuned using reinforcement learning (RL). They aim to determine the models' ability to hide messages within plain text, particularly in scenarios where hidden reasoning is likely. The experiments show that while current models exhibit basic steganographic abilities in terms of security and capacity, explicit algorithmic guidance significantly enhances their information concealment capabilities. The findings suggest that these LLMs can develop covert encoding schemes, engage in steganography when prompted, and use steganography in realistic scenarios. By detecting the intention of LLMs to hide reasoning and evaluating their steganography performance, the researchers highlight the challenges in detecting and thwarting unaligned AI agents and the potential implications for the faithfulness of LLM reasoning. <div>

Abstract: The potential for large language models (LLMs) to hide messages within plain text (steganography) poses a challenge to detection and thwarting of unaligned AI agents, and undermines faithfulness of LLMs reasoning. We explore the steganographic capabilities of LLMs fine-tuned via reinforcement learning (RL) to: (1) develop covert encoding schemes, (2) engage in steganography when prompted, and (3) utilize steganography in realistic scenarios where hidden reasoning is likely, but not prompted. In these scenarios, we detect the intention of LLMs to hide their reasoning as well as their steganography performance. Our findings in the fine-tuning experiments as well as in behavioral non fine-tuning evaluations reveal that while current models exhibit rudimentary steganographic abilities in terms of security and capacity, explicit algorithmic guidance markedly enhances their capacity for information concealment.

<div> evaluation, AI models, arena framework, stable, large language models (LLMs)

Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces a novel stable arena framework for evaluating modern AI models, specifically large language models (LLMs). The framework addresses issues with existing methods by enhancing the ELO Rating System with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach, m-ELO, and am-ELO, which considers annotator abilities. The MLE approach is proven to be consistent and stable for model ranking, providing a more robust evaluation method. The am-ELO method incorporates annotator abilities, allowing for simultaneous estimation of model scores and annotator reliability. Experiments demonstrate the stability and accuracy of this framework, showing it to be a more reliable method for evaluating LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Arena-based evaluation is a fundamental yet significant evaluation paradigm for modern AI models, especially large language models (LLMs). Existing framework based on ELO rating system suffers from the inevitable instability problem due to ranking inconsistency and the lack of attention to the varying abilities of annotators. In this paper, we introduce a novel stable arena framework to address these issues by enhancing the ELO Rating System. Specifically, we replace the iterative update method with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach, m-ELO, and provide theoretical proof of the consistency and stability of the MLE approach for model ranking. Additionally, we proposed the am-ELO, which modify the Elo Rating's probability function to incorporate annotator abilities, enabling the simultaneous estimation of model scores and annotator reliability. Experiments demonstrate that this method ensures stability, proving that this framework offers a more robust, accurate, and stable evaluation method for LLMs.

<div> approach, large language models, text-based interactive fiction games, action generation, dynamic action generation
Summary:
The article introduces STORY2GAME, a method using Large Language Models to create text-based interactive fiction games. It begins by generating a story, building the game world, and creating code for actions in a game engine to enable interactive storytelling. Unlike predefined actions limiting story generation, generating actions allows for more open-ended storytelling while maintaining grounded game experiences. Successful action generation relies on using LLM-generated preconditions and effects as guides for tracking and changing the game state when players act. The technique includes dynamically generating new actions to accommodate player choices not in the original story, requiring updates to the game engine's state representation. The evaluation focuses on the success rate of action code generation in enabling players to interactively navigate through the entire generated story.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce STORY2GAME, a novel approach to using Large Language Models to generate text-based interactive fiction games that starts by generating a story, populates the world, and builds the code for actions in a game engine that enables the story to play out interactively. Whereas a given set of hard-coded actions can artificially constrain story generation, the ability to generate actions means the story generation process can be more open-ended but still allow for experiences that are grounded in a game state. The key to successful action generation is to use LLM-generated preconditions and effects of actions in the stories as guides for what aspects of the game state must be tracked and changed by the game engine when a player performs an action. We also introduce a technique for dynamically generating new actions to accommodate the player's desire to perform actions that they think of that are not part of the story. Dynamic action generation may require on-the-fly updates to the game engine's state representation and revision of previously generated actions. We evaluate the success rate of action code generation with respect to whether a player can interactively play through the entire generated story.

<div> consensus mechanism, language models, distributed ledger technology, Hashgraph, AI ensembles

Summary:
The article introduces a novel consensus mechanism inspired by distributed ledger technology to address the issue of inconsistent outputs and hallucinations from large language models (LLMs). Different proprietary reasoning models (RMs) often produce divergent results due to variations in training and inference. The proposed mechanism, based on the Hashgraph consensus algorithm, involves treating each RM as a black-box peer and using gossip-about-gossip communication and virtual voting to achieve agreement among an ensemble of RMs. This approach goes beyond simple majority voting by incorporating the knowledge and cross-verification content of every model. The article outlines an architectural design for a prototype system where RMs exchange and update their answers iteratively to improve accuracy and confidence in subsequent rounds. This Hashgraph-inspired consensus offers a promising direction for multi-agent AI systems to self-validate and deliver high-fidelity responses in complex tasks.

Abstract: Inconsistent outputs and hallucinations from large language models (LLMs) are major obstacles to reliable AI systems. When different proprietary reasoning models (RMs), such as those by OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI, are given the same complex request, they often produce divergent results due to variations in training and inference. This paper proposes a novel consensus mechanism, inspired by distributed ledger technology, to validate and converge these outputs, treating each RM as a black-box peer. Building on the Hashgraph consensus algorithm, our approach employs gossip-about-gossip communication and virtual voting to achieve agreement among an ensemble of RMs. We present an architectural design for a prototype system in which RMs iteratively exchange and update their answers, using information from each round to improve accuracy and confidence in subsequent rounds. This approach goes beyond simple majority voting by incorporating the knowledge and cross-verification content of every model. We justify the feasibility of this Hashgraph-inspired consensus for AI ensembles and outline its advantages over traditional ensembling techniques in reducing nonfactual outputs. Preliminary considerations for implementation, evaluation criteria for convergence and accuracy, and potential challenges are discussed. The proposed mechanism demonstrates a promising direction for multi-agent AI systems to self-validate and deliver high-fidelity responses in complex tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OSUniverse: a benchmark of complex, multimodal desktop-oriented tasks for advanced GUI-navigation AI agents that focuses on ease of use, extensibility, comprehensive coverage of test cases, and automated validation. We divide the tasks in increasing levels of complexity, from basic precision clicking to multistep, multiapplication tests requiring dexterity, precision, and clear thinking from the agent. In version one of the benchmark, presented here, we have calibrated the complexity of the benchmark test cases to ensure that the SOTA (State of the Art) agents (at the time of publication) do not achieve results higher than 50%, while the average white collar worker can perform all these tasks with perfect accuracy. The benchmark can be scored manually, but we also introduce an automated validation mechanism that has an average error rate less than 2%. Therefore, this benchmark presents solid ground for fully automated measuring of progress, capabilities and the effectiveness of GUI-navigation AI agents over the short and medium-term horizon. The source code of the benchmark is available at https://github.com/agentsea/osuniverse.

Abstract: Human decision-making in cognitive tasks and daily life exhibits considerable variability, shaped by factors such as task difficulty, individual preferences, and personal experiences. Understanding this variability across individuals is essential for uncovering the perceptual and decision-making mechanisms that humans rely on when faced with uncertainty and ambiguity. We present a computational framework BAM (Boundary Alignment & Manipulation framework) that combines perceptual boundary sampling in ANNs and human behavioral experiments to systematically investigate this phenomenon. Our perceptual boundary sampling algorithm generates stimuli along ANN decision boundaries that intrinsically induce significant perceptual variability. The efficacy of these stimuli is empirically validated through large-scale behavioral experiments involving 246 participants across 116,715 trials, culminating in the variMNIST dataset containing 19,943 systematically annotated images. Through personalized model alignment and adversarial generation, we establish a reliable method for simultaneously predicting and manipulating the divergent perceptual decisions of pairs of participants. This work bridges the gap between computational models and human individual difference research, providing new tools for personalized perception analysis.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates temporal logical reasoning with Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to enable interpretable decision-making under uncertainty using macro-actions. The method utilizes a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) based on Event Calculus (EC) to create persistent macro-actions that guide POMDP solvers during planning, resulting in reduced inference time and enhanced performance. These macro-actions are learned through Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) from a small number of execution traces, eliminating the need for manual heuristics. In experiments on benchmark scenarios like Pocman and Rocksample, the learned macro-actions outperform traditional heuristics in terms of expressiveness and generality, offering significant computational efficiency gains. This approach paves the way for more efficient and interpretable decision-making in uncertain environments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes an integration of temporal logical reasoning and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to achieve interpretable decision-making under uncertainty with macro-actions. Our method leverages a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) based on Event Calculus (EC) to generate \emph{persistent} (i.e., constant) macro-actions, which guide Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based POMDP solvers over a time horizon, significantly reducing inference time while ensuring robust performance. Such macro-actions are learnt via Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) from a few traces of execution (belief-action pairs), thus eliminating the need for manually designed heuristics and requiring only the specification of the POMDP transition model. In the Pocman and Rocksample benchmark scenarios, our learned macro-actions demonstrate increased expressiveness and generality when compared to time-independent heuristics, indeed offering substantial computational efficiency improvements.

Summary: 
The study examines the impact of AI agents' ability to share inferred human goals on task performance and collaboration. Three conditions were compared - no recognition, viable goals, and viable goals on-demand. Results showed goal-sharing information did not significantly improve task performance but supported strategic adaptations and subjective perceptions of collaboration. Cognitive load assessments revealed no additional burden across conditions. The study highlights the challenge of balancing informativeness and simplicity in human-agent interactions. Goal-sharing fosters trust and enhances perceived collaboration but may not always lead to objective performance gains. <div>

Abstract: In human-agent teams, openly sharing goals is often assumed to enhance planning, collaboration, and effectiveness. However, direct communication of these goals is not always feasible, requiring teammates to infer their partner's intentions through actions. Building on this, we investigate whether an AI agent's ability to share its inferred understanding of a human teammate's goals can improve task performance and perceived collaboration. Through an experiment comparing three conditions-no recognition (NR), viable goals (VG), and viable goals on-demand (VGod) - we find that while goal-sharing information did not yield significant improvements in task performance or overall satisfaction scores, thematic analysis suggests that it supported strategic adaptations and subjective perceptions of collaboration. Cognitive load assessments revealed no additional burden across conditions, highlighting the challenge of balancing informativeness and simplicity in human-agent interactions. These findings highlight the nuanced trade-off of goal-sharing: while it fosters trust and enhances perceived collaboration, it can occasionally hinder objective performance gains.

Moreover, selecting the most effective prompting technique is a challenging yet crucial task for achieving optimal performance.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medical imaging has seen unprecedented growth in the last years, due to rapid advances in deep learning and computing resources. Applications cover the full range of existing medical imaging modalities, with unique characteristics driven by the physics of each technique. Yet, artificial intelligence professionals entering the field, and even experienced developers, often lack a comprehensive understanding of the physical principles underlying medical image acquisition, which hinders their ability to fully leverage its potential. The integration of physics knowledge into artificial intelligence algorithms enhances their trustworthiness and robustness in medical imaging, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. In this work, we review the fundamentals of physics in medical images and their impact on the latest advances in artificial intelligence, particularly, in generative models and reconstruction algorithms. Finally, we explore the integration of physics knowledge into physics-inspired machine learning models, which leverage physics-based constraints to enhance the learning of medical imaging features.

<div> sandbox, governance, regulation, artificial intelligence, signal detection theory

Summary:
In the debate over regulating Artificial Intelligence, the Precautionary Principle (PP) and the Innovation Principle (IP) are often seen as contradictory. However, weak forms of PP and IP actually complement each other by ensuring that regulatory decisions account for the costs of both overregulation and underregulation. The Signal Detection Theory (SDT) model shows that decisions to regulate AI should be based on a consideration of the expected costs of false positives and false negatives. By implementing regulatory sandboxing, regulators can observe how AI innovations impact society in a controlled setting, allowing for better decisions regarding regulation. Sandbox environments help regulators and innovators understand the cost ratio of mistakes and make appropriate adjustments to avoid excessive regulation while ensuring AI development is safe and responsible. <div>

Abstract: In policy debates concerning the governance and regulation of Artificial Intelligence (AI), both the Precautionary Principle (PP) and the Innovation Principle (IP) are advocated by their respective interest groups. Do these principles offer wholly incompatible and contradictory guidance? Does one necessarily negate the other? I argue here that provided attention is restricted to weak-form PP and IP, the answer to both of these questions is "No." The essence of these weak formulations is the requirement to fully account for type-I error costs arising from erroneously preventing the innovation's diffusion through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory red-lighting) as well as the type-II error costs arising from erroneously allowing the innovation to diffuse through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory green-lighting). Within the Signal Detection Theory (SDT) model developed here, weak-PP red-light (weak-IP green-light) determinations are optimal for sufficiently small (large) ratios of expected type-I to type-II error costs. For intermediate expected cost ratios, an amber-light 'wait-and-monitor' policy is optimal. Regulatory sandbox instruments allow AI testing and experimentation to take place within a structured environment of limited duration and societal scale, whereby the expected cost ratio falls within the 'wait-and-monitor' range. Through sandboxing regulators and innovating firms learn more about the expected cost ratio, and what respective adaptations -- of regulation, of technical solution, of business model, or combination thereof, if any -- are needed to keep the ratio out of the weak-PP red-light zone.

Assessing the understanding of large language models (LLMs) in human interactions is challenging. To address this, the Sentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE) framework is introduced, focusing on measuring an LLM's social cognition in multi-turn conversations. SAGE simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts in interaction, providing a more realistic evaluation. Experiments on 100 scenarios show that the Sentient emotion score correlates strongly with psychological metrics. A public Sentient Leaderboard comparing 18 models reveals significant performance gaps between newer systems and earlier baselines. SAGE offers a scalable and interpretable tool for tracking progress in developing genuinely empathetic language agents.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Assessing how well a large language model (LLM) understands human, rather than merely text, remains an open challenge. To bridge the gap, we introduce Sentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE), an automated evaluation framework that measures an LLM's higher-order social cognition. SAGE instantiates a Sentient Agent that simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts during interaction, providing a more realistic evaluation of the tested model in multi-turn conversations. At every turn, the agent reasons about (i) how its emotion changes, (ii) how it feels, and (iii) how it should reply, yielding a numerical emotion trajectory and interpretable inner thoughts. Experiments on 100 supportive-dialogue scenarios show that the final Sentient emotion score correlates strongly with Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) ratings and utterance-level empathy metrics, validating psychological fidelity. We also build a public Sentient Leaderboard covering 18 commercial and open-source models that uncovers substantial gaps (up to 4x) between frontier systems (GPT-4o-Latest, Gemini2.5-Pro) and earlier baselines, gaps not reflected in conventional leaderboards (e.g., Arena). SAGE thus provides a principled, scalable and interpretable tool for tracking progress toward genuinely empathetic and socially adept language agents.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) in healthcare must align with stakeholder preferences for effective implementation. Human professionals play a critical role in guiding and enhancing LLM performance throughout the lifecycle. Enhancing healthcare knowledge integration, task understanding, and human guidance can help LLMs better follow human values. The alignment between humans and LLMs is crucial for building trustworthy real-world healthcare applications. <div>

Abstract: The wide exploration of large language models (LLMs) raises the awareness of alignment between healthcare stakeholder preferences and model outputs. This alignment becomes a crucial foundation to empower the healthcare workflow effectively, safely, and responsibly. Yet the varying behaviors of LLMs may not always match with healthcare stakeholders' knowledge, demands, and values. To enable a human-AI alignment, healthcare stakeholders will need to perform essential roles in guiding and enhancing the performance of LLMs. Human professionals must participate in the entire life cycle of adopting LLM in healthcare, including training data curation, model training, and inference. In this review, we discuss the approaches, tools, and applications of alignments between healthcare stakeholders and LLMs. We demonstrate that LLMs can better follow human values by properly enhancing healthcare knowledge integration, task understanding, and human guidance. We provide outlooks on enhancing the alignment between humans and LLMs to build trustworthy real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have reignited interest in their impact on Computer-based Learning (CBL). AI-driven tools like ChatGPT and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have enhanced learning experiences through personalisation and flexibility. ITSs can adapt to individual learning needs and provide customised feedback based on a student's performance, cognitive state, and learning path. Despite these advances, challenges remain in accommodating diverse learning styles and delivering real-time, context-aware feedback. Our research aims to address these gaps by integrating skill-aligned feedback via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) into prompt engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs) and developing an application to enhance learning through personalised tutoring in a computer science programming context. The pilot study evaluated a proposed system using three quantitative metrics: readability score, response time, and feedback depth, across three programming tasks of varying complexity. The system successfully sorted simulated students into three skill-level categories and provided context-aware feedback. This targeted approach demonstrated better effectiveness and adaptability compared to general methods.

<div> Hierarchical concept map, MCQs, LLMs, common misconceptions, automated validation <br />
Summary:<br />
The study introduces a hierarchical concept map-based framework for generating high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs) targeting diverse cognitive levels and incorporating common misconceptions in physics education. The framework utilizes an efficient database design and automated pipeline to guide Language Model Models (LLMs) in generating MCQs and distractors. Expert evaluations show the framework outperforms baseline approaches with a 75.20% success rate in meeting quality criteria. Student assessments indicate a lower guess success rate (28.05%) for the concept map-driven approach, suggesting more effective assessment of conceptual understanding. The framework enables robust assessment across cognitive levels, quick identification of conceptual gaps, and facilitates targeted interventions at scale.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Generating high-quality MCQs, especially those targeting diverse cognitive levels and incorporating common misconceptions into distractor design, is time-consuming and expertise-intensive, making manual creation impractical at scale. Current automated approaches typically generate questions at lower cognitive levels and fail to incorporate domain-specific misconceptions. This paper presents a hierarchical concept map-based framework that provides structured knowledge to guide LLMs in generating MCQs with distractors. We chose high-school physics as our test domain and began by developing a hierarchical concept map covering major Physics topics and their interconnections with an efficient database design. Next, through an automated pipeline, topic-relevant sections of these concept maps are retrieved to serve as a structured context for the LLM to generate questions and distractors that specifically target common misconceptions. Lastly, an automated validation is completed to ensure that the generated MCQs meet the requirements provided. We evaluate our framework against two baseline approaches: a base LLM and a RAG-based generation. We conducted expert evaluations and student assessments of the generated MCQs. Expert evaluation shows that our method significantly outperforms the baseline approaches, achieving a success rate of 75.20% in meeting all quality criteria compared to approximately 37% for both baseline methods. Student assessment data reveal that our concept map-driven approach achieved a significantly lower guess success rate of 28.05% compared to 37.10% for the baselines, indicating a more effective assessment of conceptual understanding. The results demonstrate that our concept map-based approach enables robust assessment across cognitive levels and instant identification of conceptual gaps, facilitating faster feedback loops and targeted interventions at scale.

Summary: <br />
The article discusses the importance of co-adaptive dynamics in human education and the lack of computational models to simulate such interactions. The authors introduce a computational model that incorporates contextual insights on human education to evaluate different teacher-student interaction strategies. Results from simulations in a synthetic classroom setting show that bidirectional agency-based strategies outperform unilateral approaches, benefiting all types of learners. The model allows for testing and scaling of context-specific educational insights and hypothesis generation in adaptable environments. By bridging non-computational theories of human education with AI systems, the model lays a foundation for inclusive and equitable technologies that can dynamically adapt to learner needs. <div>
arXiv:2505.02853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human education transcends mere knowledge transfer, it relies on co-adaptation dynamics -- the mutual adjustment of teaching and learning strategies between agents. Despite its centrality, computational models of co-adaptive teacher-student interactions (T-SI) remain underdeveloped. We argue that this gap impedes Educational Science in testing and scaling contextual insights across diverse settings, and limits the potential of Machine Learning systems, which struggle to emulate and adaptively support human learning processes. To address this, we present a computational T-SI model that integrates contextual insights on human education into a testable framework. We use the model to evaluate diverse T-SI strategies in a realistic synthetic classroom setting, simulating student groups with unequal access to sensory information. Results show that strategies incorporating co-adaptation principles (e.g., bidirectional agency) outperform unilateral approaches (i.e., where only the teacher or the student is active), improving the learning outcomes for all learning types. Beyond the testing and scaling of context-dependent educational insights, our model enables hypothesis generation in controlled yet adaptable environments. This work bridges non-computational theories of human education with scalable, inclusive AI in Education systems, providing a foundation for equitable technologies that dynamically adapt to learner needs.

Summary:
The article introduces GPR-bench, a benchmark for generative AI systems to address challenges of reproducibility and reliability. It includes an open dataset in English and Japanese covering various tasks and scenarios, with automated evaluation using "LLM-as-a-Judge" scoring. Experiments with different model versions show modest improvements in correctness but significant enhancement in conciseness with concise-writing instructions. The benchmark may not effectively differentiate between recent model versions, highlighting the importance of prompt engineering. GPR-bench is released under the MIT License, aiming to lower the barrier to reproducibility monitoring and facilitate community-driven extensions. This study raises considerations about benchmark design for evolving language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.02854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reproducibility and reliability remain pressing challenges for generative AI systems whose behavior can drift with each model update or prompt revision. We introduce GPR-bench, a lightweight, extensible benchmark that operationalizes regression testing for general purpose use cases. GPR-bench couples an open, bilingual (English and Japanese) dataset covering eight task categories (e.g., text generation, code generation, and information retrieval) and 10 scenarios in each task categories (80 total test cases for each language) with an automated evaluation pipeline that employs "LLM-as-a-Judge" scoring of correctness and conciseness. Experiments across three recent model versions - gpt-4o-mini, o3-mini, and o4-mini - and two prompt configurations (default versus concise-writing instruction) reveal heterogeneous quality. Our results show that newer models generally improve correctness, but the differences are modest and not statistically significant, suggesting that GPR-bench may not be sufficiently challenging to differentiate between recent model versions. In contrast, the concise-writing instruction significantly enhances conciseness (+12.37 pp, Mann-Whitney U test: p < 0.001, effect size r = 0.2995) with minimal degradations on accuracy (-1.7 pp), demonstrating the effectiveness of prompt engineering. Released under the MIT License, GPR- bench lowers the barrier to initiating reproducibility monitoring and provides a foundation for community-driven extensions, while also raising important considerations about benchmark design for rapidly evolving language models.

Summary: 
Data quality and availability, as well as model scalability, are common challenges faced by both AI professionals in academia and industry. However, industry professionals also encounter deployment constraints, resource limitations, and external dependencies, while academics focus more on theoretical adaptation and standardization issues. Both groups highlight difficulties in data and model adaptation, but industry professionals emphasize real-world constraints such as deployment and resource limitations. Academics, on the other hand, prioritize theoretical adaptation and standardization challenges. The study suggests that AI curricula should integrate real-world complexities, software engineering principles, and interdisciplinary learning to better prepare students for the challenges they will face in both academia and industry. Additionally, the broader educational goals of building foundational and ethical reasoning skills should be considered in AI education. <div>

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies continue to evolve, the gap between academic AI education and real-world industry challenges remains an important area of investigation. This study provides preliminary insights into challenges AI professionals encounter in both academia and industry, based on semi-structured interviews with 14 AI experts - eight from industry and six from academia. We identify key challenges related to data quality and availability, model scalability, practical constraints, user behavior, and explainability. While both groups experience data and model adaptation difficulties, industry professionals more frequently highlight deployment constraints, resource limitations, and external dependencies, whereas academics emphasize theoretical adaptation and standardization issues. These exploratory findings suggest that AI curricula could better integrate real-world complexities, software engineering principles, and interdisciplinary learning, while recognizing the broader educational goals of building foundational and ethical reasoning skills.

<div> Neural orchestration, Multi-agent systems, Task selection, Supervised learning, Adaptive architecture
Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces MetaOrch, a neural orchestration framework designed to optimize agent selection in multi-domain task environments within multi-agent systems (MAS). Traditional MAS architectures have limitations in adapting to dynamic tasks and coordinating agents effectively. MetaOrch utilizes supervised learning to predict the most suitable agent for a given task based on task context, agent histories, and expected response quality. A fuzzy evaluation module scores agent responses, generating soft supervision labels for training the orchestrator. Unlike traditional methods, MetaOrch dynamically selects agents while estimating selection confidence, outperforming baseline strategies with 86.3% accuracy in simulated environments. The modular architecture allows for independent agent registration, updates, and queries, emphasizing extensibility. The experimental results suggest that neural orchestration enhances the autonomy, interpretability, and adaptability of MAS, offering a promising approach for diverse task domains. <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are foundational in simulating complex real-world scenarios involving autonomous, interacting entities. However, traditional MAS architectures often suffer from rigid coordination mechanisms and difficulty adapting to dynamic tasks. We propose MetaOrch, a neural orchestration framework for optimal agent selection in multi-domain task environments. Our system implements a supervised learning approach that models task context, agent histories, and expected response quality to select the most appropriate agent for each task. A novel fuzzy evaluation module scores agent responses along completeness, relevance, and confidence dimensions, generating soft supervision labels for training the orchestrator. Unlike previous methods that hard-code agent-task mappings, MetaOrch dynamically predicts the most suitable agent while estimating selection confidence. Experiments in simulated environments with heterogeneous agents demonstrate that our approach achieves 86.3% selection accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline strategies including random selection and round-robin scheduling. The modular architecture emphasizes extensibility, allowing agents to be registered, updated, and queried independently. Results suggest that neural orchestration offers a powerful approach to enhancing the autonomy, interpretability, and adaptability of multi-agent systems across diverse task domains.

Summary:
The study introduces a novel jailbreak attack framework, ICRT, aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by human cognitive biases, the framework leverages the simplicity effect and relevance bias to craft malicious prompts that bypass LLMs' safety mechanisms effectively. By introducing a ranking-based harmfulness evaluation metric, the researchers surpass traditional binary success metrics, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the risks posed by generated content. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's consistent ability to generate high-risk content and bypass mainstream LLMs' defenses. The approach sheds light on potential risks associated with jailbreak attacks and offers valuable insights for enhancing defense strategies against such threats. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can compromise their safety mechanisms. Existing studies often rely on brute-force optimization or manual design, failing to uncover potential risks in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel jailbreak attack framework, ICRT, inspired by heuristics and biases in human cognition. Leveraging the simplicity effect, we employ cognitive decomposition to reduce the complexity of malicious prompts. Simultaneously, relevance bias is utilized to reorganize prompts, enhancing semantic alignment and inducing harmful outputs effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a ranking-based harmfulness evaluation metric that surpasses the traditional binary success-or-failure paradigm by employing ranking aggregation methods such as Elo, HodgeRank, and Rank Centrality to comprehensively quantify the harmfulness of generated content. Experimental results show that our approach consistently bypasses mainstream LLMs' safety mechanisms and generates high-risk content, providing insights into jailbreak attack risks and contributing to stronger defense strategies.

- Asian students report higher GAI usage and perceive greater academic benefits compared to White students, while Black students report a more positive impact on academic performance. 
- Personality traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, emotional stability, extraversion, and intellect/imagination significantly predict GAI use and attitudes. 
- Higher conscientiousness is associated with lower GAI use, while higher emotional stability leads to a more positive impact of GAI on learning. Students with higher intellect/imagination tend to prefer traditional resources. Universities should provide personalized guidance to ensure effective, ethical, and equitable use of GAI by students.

Abstract: The use of generative AI (GAI) among university students is rapidly increasing, yet empirical research on students' GAI use and the factors influencing it remains limited. To address this gap, we surveyed 363 undergraduate and graduate students in the United States, examining their GAI usage and how it relates to demographic variables and personality traits based on the Big Five model (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability, and intellect/imagination). Our findings reveal: (a) Students in higher academic years are more inclined to use GAI and prefer it over traditional resources. (b) Non-native English speakers use and adopt GAI more readily than native speakers. (c) Compared to White, Asian students report higher GAI usage, perceive greater academic benefits, and express a stronger preference for it. Similarly, Black students report a more positive impact of GAI on their academic performance. Personality traits also play a significant role in shaping perceptions and usage of GAI. After controlling demographic factors, we found that personality still significantly predicts GAI use and attitudes: (a) Students with higher conscientiousness use GAI less. (b) Students who are higher in agreeableness perceive a less positive impact of GAI on academic performance and express more ethical concerns about using it for academic work. (c) Students with higher emotional stability report a more positive impact of GAI on learning and fewer concerns about its academic use. (d) Students with higher extraversion show a stronger preference for GAI over traditional resources. (e) Students with higher intellect/imagination tend to prefer traditional resources. These insights highlight the need for universities to provide personalized guidance to ensure students use GAI effectively, ethically, and equitably in their academic pursuits.

Summary:<br />
Tree-search-based reasoning methods in large language models (LLMs) have improved reasoning capability but are hindered by slow inference due to generating numerous thoughts. To address this, a Speculative Search (SpecSearch) framework is proposed that optimizes thought generation by employing a small model to collaborate strategically with a large model at thought and token levels. SpecSearch utilizes a quality-preserving rejection mechanism to filter out low-quality thoughts, maintaining reasoning quality comparable to the large model. Experiments on Qwen and Llama models show that SpecSearch outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 2.12$\times$ speedup with similar reasoning quality. <div>

Abstract: Tree-search-based reasoning methods have significantly enhanced the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by facilitating the exploration of multiple intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., thoughts. However, these methods suffer from substantial inference latency, as they have to generate numerous reasoning thoughts, severely limiting LLM applicability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Speculative Search (SpecSearch) framework that significantly accelerates LLM reasoning by optimizing thought generation. Specifically, SpecSearch utilizes a small model to strategically collaborate with a large model at both thought and token levels, efficiently generating high-quality reasoning thoughts. The major pillar of SpecSearch is a novel quality-preserving rejection mechanism, which effectively filters out thoughts whose quality falls below that of the large model's outputs. Moreover, we show that SpecSearch preserves comparable reasoning quality to the large model. Experiments on both the Qwen and Llama models demonstrate that SpecSearch significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 2.12$\times$ speedup with comparable reasoning quality.

Summary:<br /><br />In this study, the researchers explore the possibility of automatically decoding open-ended reading goals from eye movements in reading. They introduce goal classification and goal reconstruction tasks and evaluation frameworks using large-scale eye tracking data in English with various text-specific information seeking tasks. Several multimodal LLMs are developed and compared, combining eye movements and text for goal classification and goal reconstruction. The experiments demonstrate significant success in both tasks, indicating that LLMs can effectively extract information about readers' text-specific goals from their eye movements. This research marks a significant advancement in understanding how reading goals can be inferred from eye movements, providing insights into readers' behavior and preferences. <div>

Abstract: When reading, we often have specific information that interests us in a text. For example, you might be reading this paper because you are curious about LLMs for eye movements in reading, the experimental design, or perhaps you only care about the question ``but does it work?''. More broadly, in daily life, people approach texts with any number of text-specific goals that guide their reading behavior. In this work, we ask, for the first time, whether open-ended reading goals can be automatically decoded from eye movements in reading. To address this question, we introduce goal classification and goal reconstruction tasks and evaluation frameworks, and use large-scale eye tracking for reading data in English with hundreds of text-specific information seeking tasks. We develop and compare several discriminative and generative multimodal LLMs that combine eye movements and text for goal classification and goal reconstruction. Our experiments show considerable success on both tasks, suggesting that LLMs can extract valuable information about the readers' text-specific goals from eye movements.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is pivotal in enhancing the robustness, reliability, and interpretability of Machine Learning (ML) systems for healthcare, optimizing resources and improving patient care. Despite the emergence of ML-based clinical decision support tools, the lack of principled quantification of uncertainty in ML models remains a major challenge. Current reviews have a narrow focus on analyzing the state-of-the-art UQ in specific healthcare domains without systematically evaluating method efficacy across different stages of model development, and despite a growing body of research, its implementation in healthcare applications remains limited. Therefore, in this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of current UQ in healthcare, offering an informed framework that highlights how different methods can be integrated into each stage of the ML pipeline including data processing, training and evaluation. We also highlight the most popular methods used in healthcare and novel approaches from other domains that hold potential for future adoption in the medical context. We expect this study will provide a clear overview of the challenges and opportunities of implementing UQ in the ML pipeline for healthcare, guiding researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable techniques to enhance the reliability, safety and trust from patients and clinicians on ML-driven healthcare solutions.

Summary:
The study addresses the issue of plant disease recognition in agriculture by proposing a collaborative inference framework between edge devices and cloud servers. Traditional manual methods are inefficient and costly, prompting the use of deep learning techniques. However, these techniques face challenges like inference delays and high energy consumption. The researchers pruned the DNN model for plant disease recognition using deep reinforcement learning to improve inference speed and reduce energy consumption. They also determined the optimal split point through a greedy strategy for optimal collaboration. The system was implemented using Gradio for user-friendly interaction. Experimental results showed that the collaborative inference framework significantly improved inference speed while maintaining acceptable accuracy, providing a novel solution for rapid plant disease diagnosis and prevention.

Abstract: Plant disease is a critical factor affecting agricultural production. Traditional manual recognition methods face significant drawbacks, including low accuracy, high costs, and inefficiency. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated significant benefits in identifying plant diseases, but they still face challenges such as inference delays and high energy consumption. Deep learning algorithms are difficult to run on resource-limited embedded devices. Offloading these models to cloud servers is confronted with the restriction of communication bandwidth, and all of these factors will influence the inference's efficiency. We propose a collaborative inference framework for recognizing plant diseases between edge devices and cloud servers to enhance inference speed. The DNN model for plant disease recognition is pruned through deep reinforcement learning to improve the inference speed and reduce energy consumption. Then the optimal split point is determined by a greedy strategy to achieve the best collaborated inference acceleration. Finally, the system for collaborative inference acceleration in plant disease recognition has been implemented using Gradio to facilitate friendly human-machine interaction. Experiments indicate that the proposed collaborative inference framework significantly increases inference speed while maintaining acceptable recognition accuracy, offering a novel solution for rapidly diagnosing and preventing plant diseases.

Summary:  
The paper introduces two datasets, SwallowCode and SwallowMath, released under the Llama 3.3 Community License, aimed at enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in program synthesis and mathematical reasoning. SwallowCode refines Python snippets from The-Stack-v2 through a four-stage pipeline, while SwallowMath enhances Finemath-4+ by improving the context and providing step-by-step explanations. These datasets significantly boost LLM performance by upgrading low-quality code and improving the accuracy of code generation and mathematical reasoning tasks. Continual pre-training with SwallowCode results in increased accuracy on HumanEval benchmarks, surpassing baseline models. Similarly, incorporating SwallowMath improves accuracy on mathematical datasets like GSM8K and MATH. Ablation studies show that each stage of the pipeline contributes incrementally, with rewriting being the most impactful. The openly available datasets, prompts, and checkpoints facilitate reproducible research and advancement in LLM pre-training for specialized domains.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) in program synthesis and mathematical reasoning is fundamentally limited by the quality of their pre-training corpora. We introduce two openly licensed datasets, released under the Llama 3.3 Community License, that significantly enhance LLM performance by systematically rewriting public data. SwallowCode (approximately 16.1 billion tokens) refines Python snippets from The-Stack-v2 through a novel four-stage pipeline: syntax validation, pylint-based style filtering, and a two-stage LLM rewriting process that enforces style conformity and transforms snippets into self-contained, algorithmically efficient examples. Unlike prior methods that rely on exclusionary filtering or limited transformations, our transform-and-retain approach upgrades low-quality code, maximizing data utility. SwallowMath (approximately 2.3 billion tokens) enhances Finemath-4+ by removing boilerplate, restoring context, and reformatting solutions into concise, step-by-step explanations. Within a fixed 50 billion token training budget, continual pre-training of Llama-3.1-8B with SwallowCode boosts pass@1 by +17.0 on HumanEval and +17.7 on HumanEval+ compared to Stack-Edu, surpassing the baseline model's code generation capabilities. Similarly, substituting SwallowMath yields +12.4 accuracy on GSM8K and +7.6 on MATH. Ablation studies confirm that each pipeline stage contributes incrementally, with rewriting delivering the largest gains. All datasets, prompts, and checkpoints are publicly available, enabling reproducible research and advancing LLM pre-training for specialized domains.

Summary:
This paper addresses the distinction between unlearning and obfuscation in large language models (LLMs). Current techniques for unlearning often add incorrect or irrelevant information to suppress knowledge, leaving models vulnerable to probing. The authors propose a novel unlearning method, DF-MCQ, which flattens the model predictive distribution over generated multiple-choice questions using KL-divergence to genuinely remove knowledge about target individuals. Experimental results show that DF-MCQ achieves unlearning with a refusal rate of over 90% and higher uncertainty compared to obfuscation on probing questions. This contribution highlights the importance of true removal of information for data privacy, regulatory compliance, and ethical AI deployment. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Unlearning has emerged as a critical capability for large language models (LLMs) to support data privacy, regulatory compliance, and ethical AI deployment. Recent techniques often rely on obfuscation by injecting incorrect or irrelevant information to suppress knowledge. Such methods effectively constitute knowledge addition rather than true removal, often leaving models vulnerable to probing. In this paper, we formally distinguish unlearning from obfuscation and introduce a probing-based evaluation framework to assess whether existing approaches genuinely remove targeted information. Moreover, we propose DF-MCQ, a novel unlearning method that flattens the model predictive distribution over automatically generated multiple-choice questions using KL-divergence, effectively removing knowledge about target individuals and triggering appropriate refusal behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that DF-MCQ achieves unlearning with over 90% refusal rate and a random choice-level uncertainty that is much higher than obfuscation on probing questions.

<br />Summary: Taskmaster, a British TV show blending comedy and scoring, was analyzed over 18 series and 162 episodes. Metrics like rank volatility, point spread, and winner dominance showed no significant impact on IMDb ratings, even after considering series effects. Long-term trends indicate increasing average points, slightly declining volatility, and stable rank spread. Contestants' performance styles, classified into five archetypes, appeared to influence viewer interest more than game mechanics. The show seems to maintain competitive visibility without changing its core structure. <div>

Abstract: Taskmaster is a British television show that combines comedic performance with a formal scoring system. Despite the appearance of structured competition, it remains unclear whether scoring dynamics contribute meaningfully to audience engagement. We conducted a statistical analysis of 162 episodes across 18 series, using fifteen episode-level metrics to quantify rank volatility, point spread, lead changes, and winner dominance. None of these metrics showed a significant association with IMDb ratings, even after controlling for series effects. Long-term trends suggest that average points have increased over time, while volatility has slightly declined and rank spread has remained stable. These patterns indicate an attempt to enhance competitive visibility without altering the show's structural equilibrium. We also analyzed contestant rank trajectories and identified five recurring archetypes describing performance styles. These patterns suggest that viewer interest is shaped more by contestant behavior than by game mechanics.

Abstract: Target-specific peptides, such as conotoxins, exhibit exceptional binding affinity and selectivity toward ion channels and receptors. However, their therapeutic potential remains underutilized due to the limited diversity of natural variants and the labor-intensive nature of traditional optimization strategies. Here, we present CreoPep, a deep learning-based conditional generative framework that integrates masked language modeling with a progressive masking scheme to design high-affinity peptide mutants while uncovering novel structural motifs. CreoPep employs an integrative augmentation pipeline, combining FoldX-based energy screening with temperature-controlled multinomial sampling, to generate structurally and functionally diverse peptides that retain key pharmacological properties. We validate this approach by designing conotoxin inhibitors targeting the $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, achieving submicromolar potency in electrophysiological assays. Structural analysis reveals that CreoPep-generated variants engage in both conserved and novel binding modes, including disulfide-deficient forms, thus expanding beyond conventional design paradigms. Overall, CreoPep offers a robust and generalizable platform that bridges computational peptide design with experimental validation, accelerating the discovery of next-generation peptide therapeutics.

Summary:
The article introduces the Noise-to-Meaning Recursive Self-Improvement (N2M-RSI) model, which demonstrates that an AI agent can enhance its internal complexity indefinitely by feeding its own outputs back as inputs and surpassing an information-integration threshold. This model, which is implementation-agnostic, combines concepts from self-prompting large language models, Godelian self-reference, and AutoML. The framework can be extended to interacting swarms of agents, suggesting super-linear effects when communication among instances occurs. The article includes a toy prototype in Appendix C but withholds system-specific details for safety reasons. <div>

Abstract: We present Noise-to-Meaning Recursive Self-Improvement (N2M-RSI), a minimal formal model showing that once an AI agent feeds its own outputs back as inputs and crosses an explicit information-integration threshold, its internal complexity will grow without bound under our assumptions. The framework unifies earlier ideas on self-prompting large language models, G\"odelian self-reference, and AutoML, yet remains implementation-agnostic. The model furthermore scales naturally to interacting swarms of agents, hinting at super-linear effects once communication among instances is permitted. For safety reasons, we omit system-specific implementation details and release only a brief, model-agnostic toy prototype in Appendix C.

Summary: 
The project aims to develop a machine learning system for early sepsis detection to improve patient outcomes. Existing models face challenges due to variability in patient information and population bias. To tackle this, Feature Aligned Transfer Learning (FATL) is proposed to focus on important features and combine knowledge from diverse populations. FATL ensures consistency and generalizability of the model across different clinical settings, making it a practical and scalable solution for early sepsis detection. The system has the potential to save lives, reduce healthcare costs, and support more equitable healthcare delivery.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Sepsis is a life threatening medical condition that occurs when the body has an extreme response to infection, leading to widespread inflammation, organ failure, and potentially death. Because sepsis can worsen rapidly, early detection is critical to saving lives. However, current diagnostic methods often identify sepsis only after significant damage has already occurred. Our project aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning based system to predict sepsis in its early stages, giving healthcare providers more time to intervene.
  A major problem with existing models is the wide variability in the patient information or features they use, such as heart rate, temperature, and lab results. This inconsistency makes models difficult to compare and limits their ability to work across different hospitals and settings. To solve this, we propose a method called Feature Aligned Transfer Learning (FATL), which identifies and focuses on the most important and commonly reported features across multiple studies, ensuring the model remains consistent and clinically relevant.
  Most existing models are trained on narrow patient groups, leading to population bias. FATL addresses this by combining knowledge from models trained on diverse populations, using a weighted approach that reflects each models contribution. This makes the system more generalizable and effective across different patient demographics and clinical environments. FATL offers a practical and scalable solution for early sepsis detection, particularly in hospitals with limited resources, and has the potential to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and support more equitable healthcare delivery.

<title>The Art of Repair: Optimizing Iterative Program Repair with Instruction-Tuned Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02931</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic program repair (APR) aims to reduce the manual efforts required to identify and fix errors in source code. Before the rise of LLM-based agents, a common strategy was to increase the number of generated patches, sometimes to the thousands, to achieve better repair results on benchmarks. More recently, self-iterative capabilities enabled LLMs to refine patches over multiple rounds guided by feedback. However, literature often focuses on many iterations and disregards different numbers of outputs.
  We investigate an APR pipeline that balances these two approaches, the generation of multiple outputs and multiple rounds of iteration, while imposing a limit of 10 total patches per bug. We apply three SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs - DeepSeekCoder-Instruct, Codellama-Instruct, Llama3.1-Instruct - to the APR task. We further fine-tune each model on an APR dataset with three sizes (1K, 30K, 65K) and two techniques (Full Fine-Tuning and LoRA), allowing us to assess their repair capabilities on two APR benchmarks: HumanEval-Java and Defects4J.
  Our results show that by using only a fraction (<1%) of the fine-tuning dataset, we can achieve improvements of up to 78% in the number of plausible patches generated, challenging prior studies that reported limited gains using Full Fine-Tuning. However, we find that exceeding certain thresholds leads to diminishing outcomes, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, we show that base models greatly benefit from creating patches in an iterative fashion rather than generating them all at once. In addition, the benefit of iterative strategies becomes more pronounced in complex benchmarks. Even fine-tuned models, while benefiting less from iterations, still gain advantages, particularly on complex benchmarks. The research underscores the need for balanced APR strategies that combine multi-output generation and iterative refinement.

Abstract: A key challenge in multi-agent AI is modeling social cooperation under realistic behavioral constraints. Many foundational concepts in economics and ethics such as "trust" or "morality" are often defined informally, without operational criteria or cognitive grounding, which limits their testability and implementation in artificial agents. Drawing on converging empirical evidence from primate behavior, infant cognition, and economic anthropology, we propose a conceptual framework composed of three cognitively minimal mechanisms: individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost return sensitivity. This framework reframes trust as a graded cognitive expectation, providing a simulateable basis for reciprocal exchange in artificial agents, and enabling the bottom-up emergence of scalable cooperation and institutional dynamics.

Abstract: Turning static slides into engaging video lectures takes considerable time and effort, requiring presenters to record explanations and visually guide their audience through the material. We introduce an end-to-end system designed to automate this process entirely. Given a slide deck, this system synthesizes a video lecture featuring AI-generated narration synchronized precisely with dynamic visual highlights. These highlights automatically draw attention to the specific concept being discussed, much like an effective presenter would. The core technical contribution is a novel highlight alignment module. This module accurately maps spoken phrases to locations on a given slide using diverse strategies (e.g., Levenshtein distance, LLM-based semantic analysis) at selectable granularities (line or word level) and utilizes timestamp-providing Text-to-Speech (TTS) for timing synchronization. We demonstrate the system's effectiveness through a technical evaluation using a manually annotated slide dataset with 1000 samples, finding that LLM-based alignment achieves high location accuracy (F1 > 92%), significantly outperforming simpler methods, especially on complex, math-heavy content. Furthermore, the calculated generation cost averages under $1 per hour of video, offering potential savings of two orders of magnitude compared to conservative estimates of manual production costs. This combination of high accuracy and extremely low cost positions this approach as a practical and scalable tool for transforming static slides into effective, visually-guided video lectures.

Abstract: We present Rapid Attention Distillation to Linear Attention Decoders at Scale (RADLADS), a protocol for rapidly converting softmax attention transformers into linear attention decoder models, along with two new RWKV-variant architectures, and models converted from popular Qwen2.5 open source models in 7B, 32B, and 72B sizes. Our conversion process requires only 350-700M tokens, less than 0.005% of the token count used to train the original teacher models. Converting to our 72B linear attention model costs less than \$2,000 USD at today's prices, yet quality at inference remains close to the original transformer. These models achieve state-of-the-art downstream performance across a set of standard benchmarks for linear attention models of their size. We release all our models on HuggingFace under the Apache 2.0 license, with the exception of our 72B models which are also governed by the Qwen License Agreement.

Abstract: Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) is a dual-energy mammographic technique that improves lesion visibility through the administration of an iodinated contrast agent. It acquires both a low-energy image, comparable to standard mammography, and a high-energy image, which are then combined to produce a dual-energy subtracted image highlighting lesion contrast enhancement. While CESM offers superior diagnostic accuracy compared to standard mammography, its use entails higher radiation exposure and potential side effects associated with the contrast medium. To address these limitations, we propose Seg-CycleGAN, a generative deep learning framework for Virtual Contrast Enhancement in CESM. The model synthesizes high-fidelity dual-energy subtracted images from low-energy images, leveraging lesion segmentation maps to guide the generative process and improve lesion reconstruction. Building upon the standard CycleGAN architecture, Seg-CycleGAN introduces localized loss terms focused on lesion areas, enhancing the synthesis of diagnostically relevant regions. Experiments on the CESM@UCBM dataset demonstrate that Seg-CycleGAN outperforms the baseline in terms of PSNR and SSIM, while maintaining competitive MSE and VIF. Qualitative evaluations further confirm improved lesion fidelity in the generated images. These results suggest that segmentation-aware generative models offer a viable pathway toward contrast-free CESM alternatives.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance through training on massive datasets, they can exhibit concerning behaviors such as verbatim reproduction of training data rather than true generalization. This memorization phenomenon raises significant concerns about data privacy, intellectual property rights, and the reliability of model evaluations. This paper introduces PEARL, a novel approach for detecting memorization in LLMs. PEARL assesses how sensitive an LLM's performance is to input perturbations, enabling memorization detection without requiring access to the model's internals. We investigate how input perturbations affect the consistency of outputs, enabling us to distinguish between true generalization and memorization. Our findings, following extensive experiments on the Pythia open model, provide a robust framework for identifying when the model simply regurgitates learned information. Applied on the GPT 4o models, the PEARL framework not only identified cases of memorization of classic texts from the Bible or common code from HumanEval but also demonstrated that it can provide supporting evidence that some data, such as from the New York Times news articles, were likely part of the training data of a given model.

Abstract: Synthetic data sets are used across linguistic domains and NLP tasks, particularly in scenarios where authentic data is limited (or even non-existent). One such domain is that of clinical (healthcare) contexts, where there exist significant and long-standing challenges (e.g., privacy, anonymization, and data governance) which have led to the development of an increasing number of synthetic datasets. One increasingly important category of clinical dataset is that of clinical dialogues which are especially sensitive and difficult to collect, and as such are commonly synthesized.
  While such synthetic datasets have been shown to be sufficient in some situations, little theory exists to inform how they may be best used and generalized to new applications. In this paper, we provide an overview of how synthetic datasets are created, evaluated and being used for dialogue related tasks in the medical domain. Additionally, we propose a novel typology for use in classifying types and degrees of data synthesis, to facilitate comparison and evaluation.

Abstract: Autonomous long-horizon mobile manipulation encompasses a multitude of challenges, including scene dynamics, unexplored areas, and error recovery. Recent works have leveraged foundation models for scene-level robotic reasoning and planning. However, the performance of these methods degrades when dealing with a large number of objects and large-scale environments. To address these limitations, we propose MORE, a novel approach for enhancing the capabilities of language models to solve zero-shot mobile manipulation planning for rearrangement tasks. MORE leverages scene graphs to represent environments, incorporates instance differentiation, and introduces an active filtering scheme that extracts task-relevant subgraphs of object and region instances. These steps yield a bounded planning problem, effectively mitigating hallucinations and improving reliability. Additionally, we introduce several enhancements that enable planning across both indoor and outdoor environments. We evaluate MORE on 81 diverse rearrangement tasks from the BEHAVIOR-1K benchmark, where it becomes the first approach to successfully solve a significant share of the benchmark, outperforming recent foundation model-based approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities of our approach in several complex real-world tasks, mimicking everyday activities. We make the code publicly available at https://more-model.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: LLM evaluation is challenging even the case of base models. In real world deployments, evaluation is further complicated by the interplay of task specific prompts and experiential context. At scale, bias evaluation is often based on short context, fixed choice benchmarks that can be rapidly evaluated, however, these can lose validity when the LLMs' deployed context differs. Large scale human evaluation is often seen as too intractable and costly. Here we present our journey towards developing a semi-automated bias evaluation framework for free text responses that has human insights at its core. We discuss how we developed an operational definition of bias that helped us automate our pipeline and a methodology for classifying bias beyond multiple choice. We additionally comment on how human evaluation helped us uncover problematic templates in a bias benchmark.

Abstract: This paper presents Latent Adaptive Planner (LAP), a novel approach for dynamic nonprehensile manipulation tasks that formulates planning as latent space inference, effectively learned from human demonstration videos. Our method addresses key challenges in visuomotor policy learning through a principled variational replanning framework that maintains temporal consistency while efficiently adapting to environmental changes. LAP employs Bayesian updating in latent space to incrementally refine plans as new observations become available, striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and real-time adaptability. We bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots through model-based proportional mapping that regenerates accurate kinematic-dynamic joint states and object positions from human demonstrations. Experimental evaluations across multiple complex manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that LAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches in success rate, trajectory smoothness, and energy efficiency, particularly in dynamic adaptation scenarios. Our approach enables robots to perform complex interactions with human-like adaptability while providing an expandable framework applicable to diverse robotic platforms using the same human demonstration videos.

Abstract: This study explores the application of chaos engineering to enhance the robustness of Large Language Model-Based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) in production-like environments under real-world conditions. LLM-MAS can potentially improve a wide range of tasks, from answering questions and generating content to automating customer support and improving decision-making processes. However, LLM-MAS in production or preproduction environments can be vulnerable to emergent errors or disruptions, such as hallucinations, agent failures, and agent communication failures. This study proposes a chaos engineering framework to proactively identify such vulnerabilities in LLM-MAS, assess and build resilience against them, and ensure reliable performance in critical applications.

<title>Cognitio Emergens: Agency, Dimensions, and Dynamics in Human-AI Knowledge Co-Creation</title>

Abstract: Scientific knowledge creation is fundamentally transforming as humans and AI systems evolve beyond tool-user relationships into co-evolutionary epistemic partnerships. When AlphaFold revolutionized protein structure prediction, researchers described engaging with an epistemic partner that reshaped how they conceptualized fundamental relationships. This article introduces Cognitio Emergens (CE), a framework addressing critical limitations in existing models that focus on static roles or narrow metrics while failing to capture how scientific understanding emerges through recursive human-AI interaction over time. CE integrates three components addressing these limitations: Agency Configurations describing how authority distributes between humans and AI (Directed, Contributory, Partnership), with partnerships dynamically oscillating between configurations rather than following linear progression; Epistemic Dimensions capturing six specific capabilities emerging through collaboration across Discovery, Integration, and Projection axes, creating distinctive "capability signatures" that guide development; and Partnership Dynamics identifying forces shaping how these relationships evolve, particularly the risk of epistemic alienation where researchers lose interpretive control over knowledge they formally endorse. Drawing from autopoiesis theory, social systems theory, and organizational modularity, CE reveals how knowledge co-creation emerges through continuous negotiation of roles, values, and organizational structures. By reconceptualizing human-AI scientific collaboration as fundamentally co-evolutionary, CE offers a balanced perspective that neither uncritically celebrates nor unnecessarily fears AI's evolving role, instead providing conceptual tools for cultivating partnerships that maintain meaningful human participation while enabling transformative scientific breakthroughs.

<title>VISLIX: An XAI Framework for Validating Vision Models with Slice Discovery and Analysis</title>

Abstract: Real-world machine learning models require rigorous evaluation before deployment, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving and surveillance. The evaluation of machine learning models often focuses on data slices, which are subsets of the data that share a set of characteristics. Data slice finding automatically identifies conditions or data subgroups where models underperform, aiding developers in mitigating performance issues. Despite its popularity and effectiveness, data slicing for vision model validation faces several challenges. First, data slicing often needs additional image metadata or visual concepts, and falls short in certain computer vision tasks, such as object detection. Second, understanding data slices is a labor-intensive and mentally demanding process that heavily relies on the expert's domain knowledge. Third, data slicing lacks a human-in-the-loop solution that allows experts to form hypothesis and test them interactively. To overcome these limitations and better support the machine learning operations lifecycle, we introduce VISLIX, a novel visual analytics framework that employs state-of-the-art foundation models to help domain experts analyze slices in computer vision models. Our approach does not require image metadata or visual concepts, automatically generates natural language insights, and allows users to test data slice hypothesis interactively. We evaluate VISLIX with an expert study and three use cases, that demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool in providing comprehensive insights for validating object detection models.

<title>Motion-compensated cardiac MRI using low-rank diffeomorphic flow (DMoCo)</title>

Abstract: We introduce an unsupervised motion-compensated image reconstruction algorithm for free-breathing and ungated 3D cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We express the image volume corresponding to each specific motion phase as the deformation of a single static image template. The main contribution of the work is the low-rank model for the compact joint representation of the family of diffeomorphisms, parameterized by the motion phases. The diffeomorphism at a specific motion phase is obtained by integrating a parametric velocity field along a path connecting the reference template phase to the motion phase. The velocity field at different phases is represented using a low-rank model. The static template and the low-rank motion model parameters are learned directly from the k-space data in an unsupervised fashion. The more constrained motion model is observed to offer improved recovery compared to current motion-resolved and motion-compensated algorithms for free-breathing 3D cine MRI.

<title>StableMotion: Training Motion Cleanup Models with Unpaired Corrupted Data</title>

Abstract: Motion capture (mocap) data often exhibits visually jarring artifacts due to inaccurate sensors and post-processing. Cleaning this corrupted data can require substantial manual effort from human experts, which can be a costly and time-consuming process. Previous data-driven motion cleanup methods offer the promise of automating this cleanup process, but often require in-domain paired corrupted-to-clean training data. Constructing such paired datasets requires access to high-quality, relatively artifact-free motion clips, which often necessitates laborious manual cleanup. In this work, we present StableMotion, a simple yet effective method for training motion cleanup models directly from unpaired corrupted datasets that need cleanup. The core component of our method is the introduction of motion quality indicators, which can be easily annotated through manual labeling or heuristic algorithms and enable training of quality-aware motion generation models on raw motion data with mixed quality. At test time, the model can be prompted to generate high-quality motions using the quality indicators. Our method can be implemented through a simple diffusion-based framework, leading to a unified motion generate-discriminate model, which can be used to both identify and fix corrupted frames. We demonstrate that our proposed method is effective for training motion cleanup models on raw mocap data in production scenarios by applying StableMotion to SoccerMocap, a 245-hour soccer mocap dataset containing real-world motion artifacts. The trained model effectively corrects a wide range of motion artifacts, reducing motion pops and frozen frames by 68% and 81%, respectively. See https://youtu.be/3Y7MMAH02B4 for more results.

Abstract: Best-of-$n$ (BoN) sampling is a practical approach for aligning language model outputs with human preferences without expensive fine-tuning. BoN sampling is performed by generating $n$ responses to a prompt and then selecting the sample that maximizes a reward function. BoN yields high reward values in practice at a distortion cost, as measured by the KL-divergence between the sampled and original distribution. This distortion is coarsely controlled by varying the number of samples: larger $n$ yields a higher reward at a higher distortion cost. We introduce Soft Best-of-$n$ sampling, a generalization of BoN that allows for smooth interpolation between the original distribution and reward-maximizing distribution through a temperature parameter $\lambda$. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that Soft Best-of-$n$ sampling converges sharply to the optimal tilted distribution at a rate of $O(1/n)$ in KL and the expected (relative) reward. For sequences of discrete outputs, we analyze an additive reward model that reveals the fundamental limitations of blockwise sampling.

<title>Null Counterfactual Factor Interactions for Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Hindsight relabeling is a powerful tool for overcoming sparsity in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL), especially in certain domains such as navigation and locomotion. However, hindsight relabeling can struggle in object-centric domains. For example, suppose that the goal space consists of a robotic arm pushing a particular target block to a goal location. In this case, hindsight relabeling will give high rewards to any trajectory that does not interact with the block. However, these behaviors are only useful when the object is already at the goal -- an extremely rare case in practice. A dataset dominated by these kinds of trajectories can complicate learning and lead to failures. In object-centric domains, one key intuition is that meaningful trajectories are often characterized by object-object interactions such as pushing the block with the gripper. To leverage this intuition, we introduce Hindsight Relabeling using Interactions (HInt), which combines interactions with hindsight relabeling to improve the sample efficiency of downstream RL. However because interactions do not have a consensus statistical definition tractable for downstream GCRL, we propose a definition of interactions based on the concept of null counterfactual: a cause object is interacting with a target object if, in a world where the cause object did not exist, the target object would have different transition dynamics. We leverage this definition to infer interactions in Null Counterfactual Interaction Inference (NCII), which uses a "nulling'' operation with a learned model to infer interactions. NCII is able to achieve significantly improved interaction inference accuracy in both simple linear dynamics domains and dynamic robotic domains in Robosuite, Robot Air Hockey, and Franka Kitchen and HInt improves sample efficiency by up to 4x.

Abstract: Comprehending long videos remains a significant challenge for Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs). Current LMMs struggle to process even minutes to hours videos due to their lack of explicit memory and retrieval mechanisms. To address this limitation, we propose RAVU (Retrieval Augmented Video Understanding), a novel framework for video understanding enhanced by retrieval with compositional reasoning over a spatio-temporal graph. We construct a graph representation of the video, capturing both spatial and temporal relationships between entities. This graph serves as a long-term memory, allowing us to track objects and their actions across time. To answer complex queries, we decompose the queries into a sequence of reasoning steps and execute these steps on the graph, retrieving relevant key information. Our approach enables more accurate understanding of long videos, particularly for queries that require multi-hop reasoning and tracking objects across frames. Our approach demonstrate superior performances with limited retrieved frames (5-10) compared with other SOTA methods and baselines on two major video QA datasets, NExT-QA and EgoSchema.

<title>seq-JEPA: Autoregressive Predictive Learning of Invariant-Equivariant World Models</title>

arXiv:2505.03176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current self-supervised algorithms mostly rely on transformations such as data augmentation and masking to learn visual representations. This is achieved by inducing invariance or equivariance with respect to these transformations after encoding two views of an image. This dominant two-view paradigm can limit the flexibility of learned representations for downstream adaptation by creating performance trade-offs between invariance-related tasks such as image classification and more fine-grained equivariance-related tasks. In this work, we introduce \emph{seq-JEPA}, a world modeling paradigm based on joint-embedding predictive architecture that leverages architectural inductive biases to resolve this trade-off. Without requiring an additional equivariance predictor or loss term, seq-JEPA simultaneously learns two architecturally segregated representations: one equivariant to the specified transformations and another invariant to them and suited for tasks such as classification. To do so, our model processes a short sequence of different views (observations) of an input image. Each encoded view is concatenated with embeddings corresponding to the relative transformation (action) producing the next observation in the sequence. A transformer encoder outputs an aggregate representation of this sequence, which is subsequently conditioned on the action leading to the next observation to predict its representation. Empirically, seq-JEPA achieves strong performance on equivariant benchmarks and image classification without sacrificing one for the other. Additionally, our framework excels at tasks that inherently require aggregating a sequence of observations, such as path integration across actions and predictive learning across eye movements.

Abstract: With the rise of short video platforms in global communication, embedding steganographic data in audio synchronization streams has emerged as a new covert communication method. To address the limitations of traditional techniques in detecting synchronized steganography, this paper proposes a detection and distributed guidance reconstruction model based on short video "Yupan" samples released by China's South Sea Fleet on TikTok. The method integrates sliding spectrum feature extraction and intelligent inference mechanisms. A 25 ms sliding window with short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used to extract the main frequency trajectory and construct the synchronization frame detection model (M1), identifying a frame flag "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF80". The subsequent 32-byte payload is decoded by a structured model (M2) to infer distributed guidance commands. Analysis reveals a low-entropy, repetitive byte sequence in the 36 to 45 second audio segment with highly concentrated spectral energy, confirming the presence of synchronization frames. Although plaintext semantics are not restored, the consistency in command field layout suggests features of military communication protocols. The multi-segment splicing model further shows cross-video embedding and centralized decoding capabilities. The proposed framework validates the effectiveness of sliding spectral features for synchronized steganography detection and builds an extensible inference model for covert communication analysis and tactical guidance simulation on open platforms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong potential across a variety of tasks in communications and networking due to their advanced reasoning capabilities. However, because different LLMs have different model structures and are trained using distinct corpora and methods, they may offer varying optimization strategies for the same network issues. Moreover, the limitations of an individual LLM's training data, aggravated by the potential maliciousness of its hosting device, can result in responses with low confidence or even bias. To address these challenges, we propose a blockchain-enabled collaborative framework that connects multiple LLMs into a Trustworthy Multi-LLM Network (MultiLLMN). This architecture enables the cooperative evaluation and selection of the most reliable and high-quality responses to complex network optimization problems. Specifically, we begin by reviewing related work and highlighting the limitations of existing LLMs in collaboration and trust, emphasizing the need for trustworthiness in LLM-based systems. We then introduce the workflow and design of the proposed Trustworthy MultiLLMN framework. Given the severity of False Base Station (FBS) attacks in B5G and 6G communication systems and the difficulty of addressing such threats through traditional modeling techniques, we present FBS defense as a case study to empirically validate the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we outline promising future research directions in this emerging area.

Abstract: Acquiring structured data from domain-specific, image-based documents such as scanned reports is crucial for many downstream tasks but remains challenging due to document variability. Many of these documents exist as images rather than as machine-readable text, which requires human annotation to train automated extraction systems. We present DocSpiral, the first Human-in-the-Spiral assistive document annotation platform, designed to address the challenge of extracting structured information from domain-specific, image-based document collections. Our spiral design establishes an iterative cycle in which human annotations train models that progressively require less manual intervention. DocSpiral integrates document format normalization, comprehensive annotation interfaces, evaluation metrics dashboard, and API endpoints for the development of AI / ML models into a unified workflow. Experiments demonstrate that our framework reduces annotation time by at least 41\% while showing consistent performance gains across three iterations during model training. By making this annotation platform freely accessible, we aim to lower barriers to AI/ML models development in document processing, facilitating the adoption of large language models in image-based, document-intensive fields such as geoscience and healthcare. The system is freely available at: https://app.ai4wa.com. The demonstration video is available: https://app.ai4wa.com/docs/docspiral/demo.

Abstract: This study introduces an innovative crossover operator named Particle Swarm Optimization-inspired Crossover (PSOX), which is specifically developed for real-coded genetic algorithms. Departing from conventional crossover approaches that only exchange information between individuals within the same generation, PSOX uniquely incorporates guidance from both the current global best solution and historical optimal solutions across multiple generations. This novel mechanism enables the algorithm to maintain population diversity while simultaneously accelerating convergence toward promising regions of the search space. The effectiveness of PSOX is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments on 15 benchmark test functions with diverse characteristics, including unimodal, multimodal, and highly complex landscapes. Comparative analysis against five state-of-the-art crossover operators reveals that PSOX consistently delivers superior performance in terms of solution accuracy, algorithmic stability, and convergence speed, especially when combined with an appropriate mutation strategy. Furthermore, the study provides an in-depth investigation of how different mutation rates influence PSOX's performance, yielding practical guidelines for parameter tuning when addressing optimization problems with varying landscape properties.

Abstract: Natural language goes beyond dryly describing visual content. It contains rich abstract concepts to express feeling, creativity and properties that cannot be directly perceived. Yet, current research in Vision Language Models (VLMs) has not shed light on abstract-oriented language. Our research breaks new ground by uncovering its wide presence and under-estimated value, with extensive analysis. Particularly, we focus our investigation on the fashion domain, a highly-representative field with abstract expressions. By analyzing recent large-scale multimodal fashion datasets, we find that abstract terms have a dominant presence, rivaling the concrete ones, providing novel information, and being useful in the retrieval task. However, a critical challenge emerges: current general-purpose or fashion-specific VLMs are pre-trained with databases that lack sufficient abstract words in their text corpora, thus hindering their ability to effectively represent abstract-oriented language. We propose a training-free and model-agnostic method, Abstract-to-Concrete Translator (ACT), to shift abstract representations towards well-represented concrete ones in the VLM latent space, using pre-trained models and existing multimodal databases. On the text-to-image retrieval task, despite being training-free, ACT outperforms the fine-tuned VLMs in both same- and cross-dataset settings, exhibiting its effectiveness with a strong generalization capability. Moreover, the improvement introduced by ACT is consistent with various VLMs, making it a plug-and-play solution.

Abstract: While modern Requirements Engineering (RE) heavily relies on natural language processing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, their effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of high-quality datasets. This paper introduces Synthline, a Product Line (PL) approach that leverages Large Language Models to systematically generate synthetic RE data for classification-based use cases. Through an empirical evaluation conducted in the context of using ML for the identification of requirements specification defects, we investigated both the diversity of the generated data and its utility for training downstream models. Our analysis reveals that while synthetic datasets exhibit less diversity than real data, they are good enough to serve as viable training resources. Moreover, our evaluation shows that combining synthetic and real data leads to substantial performance improvements. Specifically, hybrid approaches achieve up to 85% improvement in precision and a 2x increase in recall compared to models trained exclusively on real data. These findings demonstrate the potential of PL-based synthetic data generation to address data scarcity in RE. We make both our implementation and generated datasets publicly available to support reproducibility and advancement in the field.

Abstract: Recently, the superior performance of Transformers has made them a more robust and scalable solution for sequence modeling than traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, the effectiveness of Transformer in capturing long-term dependencies is primarily attributed to their comprehensive pair-modeling process rather than inherent inductive biases toward sequence semantics. In this study, we explore the capabilities of pure RNNs and reassess their long-term learning mechanisms. Inspired by the physics energy transition models that track energy changes over time, we propose a effective recurrent structure called the``Physics-inspired Energy Transition Neural Network" (PETNN). We demonstrate that PETNN's memory mechanism effectively stores information over long-term dependencies. Experimental results indicate that PETNN outperforms transformer-based methods across various sequence tasks. Furthermore, owing to its recurrent nature, PETNN exhibits significantly lower complexity. Our study presents an optimal foundational recurrent architecture and highlights the potential for developing effective recurrent neural networks in fields currently dominated by Transformer.

Abstract: We present Mixture of Discrete-time Gaussian Processes (MiDiGap), a novel approach for flexible policy representation and imitation learning in robot manipulation. MiDiGap enables learning from as few as five demonstrations using only camera observations and generalizes across a wide range of challenging tasks. It excels at long-horizon behaviors such as making coffee, highly constrained motions such as opening doors, dynamic actions such as scooping with a spatula, and multimodal tasks such as hanging a mug. MiDiGap learns these tasks on a CPU in less than a minute and scales linearly to large datasets. We also develop a rich suite of tools for inference-time steering using evidence such as collision signals and robot kinematic constraints. This steering enables novel generalization capabilities, including obstacle avoidance and cross-embodiment policy transfer. MiDiGap achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse few-shot manipulation benchmarks. On constrained RLBench tasks, it improves policy success by 76 percentage points and reduces trajectory cost by 67%. On multimodal tasks, it improves policy success by 48 percentage points and increases sample efficiency by a factor of 20. In cross-embodiment transfer, it more than doubles policy success. We make the code publicly available at https://midigap.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: Foundation models constitute a significant advancement in computer vision: after a single, albeit costly, training phase, they can address a wide array of tasks. In the field of Earth observation, over 75 remote sensing vision foundation models have been developed in the past four years. However, none has consistently outperformed the others across all available downstream tasks. To facilitate their comparison, we propose a cost-effective method for predicting a model's performance on multiple downstream tasks without the need for fine-tuning on each one. This method is based on what we call "capabilities encoding." The utility of this novel approach is twofold: we demonstrate its potential to simplify the selection of a foundation model for a given new task, and we employ it to offer a fresh perspective on the existing literature, suggesting avenues for future research. Codes are available at https://github.com/pierreadorni/capabilities-encoding.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of lightweight deep learning models for image classification, emphasizing their suitability for deployment in resource-constrained environments such as low-memory devices. Five state-of-the-art architectures - MobileNetV3 Small, ResNet18, SqueezeNet, EfficientNetV2-S, and ShuffleNetV2 - are benchmarked across three diverse datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet. The models are assessed using four key performance metrics: classification accuracy, inference time, floating-point operations (FLOPs), and model size. Additionally, we investigate the impact of hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, and training paradigms by comparing pretrained models with scratch-trained counterparts, focusing on MobileNetV3 Small. Our findings reveal that transfer learning significantly enhances model accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly for complex datasets like Tiny ImageNet. EfficientNetV2 consistently achieves the highest accuracy, while MobileNetV3 offers the best balance between accuracy and efficiency, and SqueezeNet excels in inference speed and compactness. This study highlights critical trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, offering actionable insights for deploying lightweight models in real-world applications where computational resources are limited. By addressing these challenges, this research contributes to optimizing deep learning systems for edge computing and mobile platforms.

Abstract: The recent surge in the popularity of diffusion models for image synthesis has attracted new attention to their potential for generation tasks in other domains. However, their applications to symbolic music generation remain largely under-explored because symbolic music is typically represented as sequences of discrete events and standard diffusion models are not well-suited for discrete data. We represent symbolic music as image-like pianorolls, facilitating the use of diffusion models for the generation of symbolic music. Moreover, this study introduces a novel diffusion model that incorporates our proposed Transformer-Mamba block and learnable wavelet transform. Classifier-free guidance is utilised to generate symbolic music with target chords. Our evaluation shows that our method achieves compelling results in terms of music quality and controllability, outperforming the strong baseline in pianoroll generation.

<title>SD-VSum: A Method and Dataset for Script-Driven Video Summarization</title>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the task of script-driven video summarization, which aims to produce a summary of the full-length video by selecting the parts that are most relevant to a user-provided script outlining the visual content of the desired summary. Following, we extend a recently-introduced large-scale dataset for generic video summarization (VideoXum) by producing natural language descriptions of the different human-annotated summaries that are available per video. In this way we make it compatible with the introduced task, since the available triplets of ``video, summary and summary description'' can be used for training a method that is able to produce different summaries for a given video, driven by the provided script about the content of each summary. Finally, we develop a new network architecture for script-driven video summarization (SD-VSum), that relies on the use of a cross-modal attention mechanism for aligning and fusing information from the visual and text modalities. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the advanced performance of SD-VSum against state-of-the-art approaches for query-driven and generic (unimodal and multimodal) summarization from the literature, and document its capacity to produce video summaries that are adapted to each user's needs about their content.

<title>Very High-Resolution Forest Mapping with TanDEM-X InSAR Data and Self-Supervised Learning</title>

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown encouraging capabilities for mapping accurately forests at medium resolution with TanDEM-X interferometric SAR data. Such models, as most of current state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in remote sensing, are trained in a fully-supervised way, which requires a large amount of labeled data for training and validation. In this work, our aim is to exploit the high-resolution capabilities of the TanDEM-X mission to map forests at 6 m. The goal is to overcome the intrinsic limitations posed by midresolution products, which affect, e.g., the detection of narrow roads within vegetated areas and the precise delineation of forested regions contours. To cope with the lack of extended reliable reference datasets at such a high resolution, we investigate self-supervised learning techniques for extracting highly informative representations from the input features, followed by a supervised training step with a significantly smaller number of reliable labels. A 1 m resolution forest/non-forest reference map over Pennsylvania, USA, allows for comparing different training approaches for the development of an effective forest mapping framework with limited labeled samples. We select the best-performing approach over this test region and apply it in a real-case forest mapping scenario over the Amazon rainforest, where only very few labeled data at high resolution are available. In this challenging scenario, the proposed self-supervised framework significantly enhances the classification accuracy with respect to fully-supervised methods, trained using the same amount of labeled data, representing an extremely promising starting point for large-scale, very high-resolution forest mapping with TanDEM-X data.

<title>Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models by learning directly from outcome-based rewards. Recent RLVR works that operate under the zero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still depend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training. The scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the long-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already evident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a hypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by humans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To address these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in which a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any external data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability by using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and verify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide open-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without external data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens of thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is compatible with various model classes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for generative recommender systems due to their transformative capabilities in user interaction. However, ensuring they do not recommend out-of-domain (OOD) items remains a challenge. We study two distinct methods to address this issue: RecLM-ret, a retrieval-based method, and RecLM-cgen, a constrained generation method. Both methods integrate seamlessly with existing LLMs to ensure in-domain recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on three recommendation datasets demonstrate that RecLM-cgen consistently outperforms RecLM-ret and existing LLM-based recommender models in accuracy while eliminating OOD recommendations, making it the preferred method for adoption. Additionally, RecLM-cgen maintains strong generalist capabilities and is a lightweight plug-and-play module for easy integration into LLMs, offering valuable practical benefits for the community.

Abstract: Visual Generative AI models have demonstrated remarkable capability in generating high-quality images from simple inputs like text prompts. However, because these models are trained on images from diverse sources, they risk memorizing and reproducing specific content, raising concerns about intellectual property (IP) infringement. Recent advances in prompt engineering offer a cost-effective way to enhance generative AI performance. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of prompt engineering techniques in mitigating IP infringement risks in image generation. Our findings show that Chain of Thought Prompting and Task Instruction Prompting significantly reduce the similarity between generated images and the training data of diffusion models, thereby lowering the risk of IP infringement.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by their substantial computational and memory demands. While structured pruning presents a viable approach by eliminating entire network components, existing methods suffer from performance degradation, reliance on heuristic metrics, or expensive finetuning. To address these challenges, we propose SPAP (Structured Pruning via Alternating Optimization and Penalty Methods), a novel and efficient structured pruning framework for LLMs grounded in optimization theory. SPAP formulates the pruning problem through a mixed-integer optimization model, employs a penalty method that effectively makes pruning decisions to minimize pruning errors, and introduces an alternating minimization algorithm tailored to the splittable problem structure for efficient weight updates and performance recovery. Extensive experiments on OPT, LLaMA-3/3.1/3.2, and Qwen2.5 models demonstrate SPAP's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, delivering linear inference speedups (1.29$\times$ at 30% sparsity) and proportional memory reductions. Our work offers a practical, optimization-driven solution for pruning LLMs while preserving model performance.

<title>Reinforced Correlation Between Vision and Language for Precise Medical AI Assistant</title>

Abstract: Medical AI assistants support doctors in disease diagnosis, medical image analysis, and report generation. However, they still face significant challenges in clinical use, including limited accuracy with multimodal content and insufficient validation in real-world settings. We propose RCMed, a full-stack AI assistant that improves multimodal alignment in both input and output, enabling precise anatomical delineation, accurate localization, and reliable diagnosis through hierarchical vision-language grounding. A self-reinforcing correlation mechanism allows visual features to inform language context, while language semantics guide pixel-wise attention, forming a closed loop that refines both modalities. This correlation is enhanced by a color region description strategy, translating anatomical structures into semantically rich text to learn shape-location-text relationships across scales. Trained on 20 million image-mask-description triplets, RCMed achieves state-of-the-art precision in contextualizing irregular lesions and subtle anatomical boundaries, excelling in 165 clinical tasks across 9 modalities. It achieved a 23.5% relative improvement in cell segmentation from microscopy images over prior methods. RCMed's strong vision-language alignment enables exceptional generalization, with state-of-the-art performance in external validation across 20 clinically significant cancer types, including novel tasks. This work demonstrates how integrated multimodal models capture fine-grained patterns, enabling human-level interpretation in complex scenarios and advancing human-centric AI healthcare.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have recently been employed to determine whether a specific text was part of the pre-training data of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods often misinfer non-members as members, leading to a high false positive rate, or depend on additional reference models for probability calibration, which limits their practicality. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel framework called Automatic Calibration Membership Inference Attack (ACMIA), which utilizes a tunable temperature to calibrate output probabilities effectively. This approach is inspired by our theoretical insights into maximum likelihood estimation during the pre-training of LLMs. We introduce ACMIA in three configurations designed to accommodate different levels of model access and increase the probability gap between members and non-members, improving the reliability and robustness of membership inference. Extensive experiments on various open-source LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attack is highly effective, robust, and generalizable, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines across three widely used benchmarks. Our code is available at: \href{https://github.com/Salehzz/ACMIA}{\textcolor{blue}{Github}}.

<title>DDaTR: Dynamic Difference-aware Temporal Residual Network for Longitudinal Radiology Report Generation</title>

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) automates the creation of radiology reports from medical imaging, enhancing the efficiency of the reporting process. Longitudinal Radiology Report Generation (LRRG) extends RRG by incorporating the ability to compare current and prior exams, facilitating the tracking of temporal changes in clinical findings. Existing LRRG approaches only extract features from prior and current images using a visual pre-trained encoder, which are then concatenated to generate the final report. However, these methods struggle to effectively capture both spatial and temporal correlations during the feature extraction process. Consequently, the extracted features inadequately capture the information of difference across exams and thus underrepresent the expected progressions, leading to sub-optimal performance in LRRG. To address this, we develop a novel dynamic difference-aware temporal residual network (DDaTR). In DDaTR, we introduce two modules at each stage of the visual encoder to capture multi-level spatial correlations. The Dynamic Feature Alignment Module (DFAM) is designed to align prior features across modalities for the integrity of prior clinical information. Prompted by the enriched prior features, the dynamic difference-aware module (DDAM) captures favorable difference information by identifying relationships across exams. Furthermore, our DDaTR employs the dynamic residual network to unidirectionally transmit longitudinal information, effectively modelling temporal correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on three benchmarks, proving its efficacy in both RRG and LRRG tasks.

Abstract: This research paper investigates the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare, specifically focusing on enhancing medical decision support through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrated with hospital-specific data and fine-tuning using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA). The system utilizes Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct as its foundation model. By embedding and retrieving context-relevant healthcare information, the system significantly improves response accuracy. QLoRA facilitates notable parameter efficiency and memory optimization, preserving the integrity of medical information through specialized quantization techniques. Our research also shows that our model performs relatively well on various medical benchmarks, indicating that it can be used to make basic medical suggestions. This paper details the system's technical components, including its architecture, quantization methods, and key healthcare applications such as enhanced disease prediction from patient symptoms and medical history, treatment suggestions, and efficient summarization of complex medical reports. We touch on the ethical considerations-patient privacy, data security, and the need for rigorous clinical validation-as well as the practical challenges of integrating such systems into real-world healthcare workflows. Furthermore, the lightweight quantized weights ensure scalability and ease of deployment even in low-resource hospital environments. Finally, the paper concludes with an analysis of the broader impact of LLMs on healthcare and outlines future directions for LLMs in medical settings.

Abstract: The growing need for Trusted AI (TAI) highlights the importance of interpretability and robustness in machine learning models. However, many existing tools overlook graph data and rarely combine these two aspects into a single solution. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a popular approach, achieving top results across various tasks. We introduce GNN-AID (Graph Neural Network Analysis, Interpretation, and Defense), an open-source framework designed for graph data to address this gap. Built as a Python library, GNN-AID supports advanced trust methods and architectural layers, allowing users to analyze graph datasets and GNN behavior using attacks, defenses, and interpretability methods.
  GNN-AID is built on PyTorch-Geometric, offering preloaded datasets, models, and support for any GNNs through customizable interfaces. It also includes a web interface with tools for graph visualization and no-code features like an interactive model builder, simplifying the exploration and analysis of GNNs. The framework also supports MLOps techniques, ensuring reproducibility and result versioning to track and revisit analyses efficiently.
  GNN-AID is a flexible tool for developers and researchers. It helps developers create, analyze, and customize graph models, while also providing access to prebuilt datasets and models for quick experimentation. Researchers can use the framework to explore advanced topics on the relationship between interpretability and robustness, test defense strategies, and combine methods to protect against different types of attacks.
  We also show how defenses against evasion and poisoning attacks can conflict when applied to graph data, highlighting the complex connections between defense strategies.

Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a vital non-invasive tool for diagnosing heart diseases and evaluating cardiac health. However, the limited availability of large-scale, high-quality CMR datasets poses a major challenge to the effective application of artificial intelligence (AI) in this domain. Even the amount of unlabeled data and the health status it covers are difficult to meet the needs of model pretraining, which hinders the performance of AI models on downstream tasks. In this study, we present Cardiac Phenotype-Guided CMR Generation (CPGG), a novel approach for generating diverse CMR data that covers a wide spectrum of cardiac health status. The CPGG framework consists of two stages: in the first stage, a generative model is trained using cardiac phenotypes derived from CMR data; in the second stage, a masked autoregressive diffusion model, conditioned on these phenotypes, generates high-fidelity CMR cine sequences that capture both structural and functional features of the heart in a fine-grained manner. We synthesized a massive amount of CMR to expand the pretraining data. Experimental results show that CPGG generates high-quality synthetic CMR data, significantly improving performance on various downstream tasks, including diagnosis and cardiac phenotypes prediction. These gains are demonstrated across both public and private datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Code is availabel at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CPGG.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise for various applications in healthcare. However, their efficacy in the Arabic medical domain remains unexplored due to the lack of high-quality domain-specific datasets and benchmarks. This study introduces MedArabiQ, a novel benchmark dataset consisting of seven Arabic medical tasks, covering multiple specialties and including multiple choice questions, fill-in-the-blank, and patient-doctor question answering. We first constructed the dataset using past medical exams and publicly available datasets. We then introduced different modifications to evaluate various LLM capabilities, including bias mitigation. We conducted an extensive evaluation with five state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5. Our findings highlight the need for the creation of new high-quality benchmarks that span different languages to ensure fair deployment and scalability of LLMs in healthcare. By establishing this benchmark and releasing the dataset, we provide a foundation for future research aimed at evaluating and enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs for the equitable use of generative AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Centralized and distributed systems are two main approaches to organizing ICT infrastructure, each with its pros and cons. Centralized systems concentrate resources in one location, making management easier but creating single points of failure. Distributed systems, on the other hand, spread resources across multiple nodes, offering better scalability and fault tolerance, but requiring more complex management. The choice between them depends on factors like application needs, scalability, and data sensitivity. Centralized systems suit applications with limited scalability and centralized control, while distributed systems excel in large-scale environments requiring high availability and performance. This paper explores a distributed document repository system developed for the Italian Ministry of Justice, using edge repositories to analyze textual data and metadata, enhancing semantic exploration capabilities.

Abstract: The rise of QR code based phishing ("Quishing") poses a growing cybersecurity threat, as attackers increasingly exploit QR codes to bypass traditional phishing defenses. Existing detection methods predominantly focus on URL analysis, which requires the extraction of the QR code payload, and may inadvertently expose users to malicious content. Moreover, QR codes can encode various types of data beyond URLs, such as Wi-Fi credentials and payment information, making URL-based detection insufficient for broader security concerns. To address these gaps, we propose the first framework for quishing detection that directly analyzes QR code structure and pixel patterns without extracting the embedded content. We generated a dataset of phishing and benign QR codes and we used it to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Our best-performing model (XGBoost) achieves an AUC of 0.9106, demonstrating the feasibility of QR-centric detection. Through feature importance analysis, we identify key visual indicators of malicious intent and refine our feature set by removing non-informative pixels, improving performance to an AUC of 0.9133 with a reduced feature space. Our findings reveal that the structural features of QR code correlate strongly with phishing risk. This work establishes a foundation for quishing mitigation and highlights the potential of direct QR analysis as a critical layer in modern phishing defenses.

Abstract: Finding the optimal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) configuration for a given use case can be complex and expensive. Motivated by this challenge, frameworks for RAG hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) have recently emerged, yet their effectiveness has not been rigorously benchmarked. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive study involving 5 HPO algorithms over 5 datasets from diverse domains, including a new one collected for this work on real-world product documentation. Our study explores the largest HPO search space considered to date, with two optimized evaluation metrics. Analysis of the results shows that RAG HPO can be done efficiently, either greedily or with iterative random search, and that it significantly boosts RAG performance for all datasets. For greedy HPO approaches, we show that optimizing models first is preferable to the prevalent practice of optimizing sequentially according to the RAG pipeline order.

Abstract: Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods primarily depend on photometric and geometric consistency constraints. In contrast, modern learning-based algorithms often rely on the plane sweep algorithm to infer 3D geometry, applying explicit geometric consistency (GC) checks only as a post-processing step, with no impact on the learning process itself. In this work, we introduce GC MVSNet plus plus, a novel approach that actively enforces geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views (multi view) and at various scales (multi scale) during the learning phase (see Fig. 1). This integrated GC check significantly accelerates the learning process by directly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, effectively halving the number of training iterations compared to other MVS methods. Furthermore, we introduce a densely connected cost regularization network with two distinct block designs simple and feature dense optimized to harness dense feature connections for enhanced regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state of the art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets and secures second place on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To our knowledge, GC MVSNet plus plus is the first method to enforce multi-view, multi-scale supervised geometric consistency during learning. Our code is available.

This paper addresses the memorization phenomenon in time series imputation models, introducing the Loss-Based with Reference Model (LBRM) algorithm. The LBRM method leverages a reference model to enhance the accuracy of membership inference attacks, distinguishing between training and test data. Our contributions are twofold: first, we propose an innovative method to effectively extract and identify memorized training data, significantly improving detection accuracy. On average, without fine-tuning, the AUROC improved by approximately 40\%. With fine-tuning, the AUROC increased by approximately 60\%. Second, we validate our approach through membership inference attacks on two types of architectures designed for time series imputation, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the LBRM approach in different contexts. These results highlight the significant enhancement in detection accuracy provided by the LBRM approach, addressing privacy risks in time series imputation models.

<title>From Neurons to Computation: Biological Reservoir Computing for Pattern Recognition</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm for reservoir computing (RC) that leverages a pool of cultured biological neurons as the reservoir substrate, creating a biological reservoir computing (BRC). This system operates similarly to an echo state network (ESN), with the key distinction that the neural activity is generated by a network of cultured neurons, rather than being modeled by traditional artificial computational units. The neuronal activity is recorded using a multi-electrode array (MEA), which enables high-throughput recording of neural signals. In our approach, inputs are introduced into the network through a subset of the MEA electrodes, while the remaining electrodes capture the resulting neural activity. This generates a nonlinear mapping of the input data to a high-dimensional biological feature space, where distinguishing between data becomes more efficient and straightforward, allowing a simple linear classifier to perform pattern recognition tasks effectively. To evaluate the performance of our proposed system, we present an experimental study that includes various input patterns, such as positional codes, bars with different orientations, and a digit recognition task. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using biological neural networks to perform tasks traditionally handled by artificial neural networks, paving the way for further exploration of biologically-inspired computing systems, with potential applications in neuromorphic engineering and bio-hybrid computing.

Abstract: Deep learning has substantially advanced the Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). However, existing researches have predominantly focused on raw performance gains, with little attention paid to quantifying the transferability of architectural components. In this paper, we introduce the concept of "Universality" and its associated definitions which extend the traditional notion of "Generalization" to encompass the modules' ease of transferability, thus revealing the relationships between module universality and model generalizability. Then we propose the Universality Assessment Equation (UAE), a metric for quantifying how readily a given module could be transplanted across models. Guided by the UAE results of standard residual blocks and other plug-and-play modules, we further design two optimized modules, Cycle Residual Block (CRB) and Depth-Wise Cycle Residual Block (DCRB). Through comprehensive experiments on natural-scene benchmarks, remote-sensing datasets, extreme-industrial imagery and on-device deployments, we demonstrate that networks embedded with the proposed plug-and-play modules outperform several state-of-the-arts, reaching a PSNR enhancement of up to 0.83dB or enabling a 71.3% reduction in parameters with negligible loss in reconstruction fidelity.

Abstract: The personalization of Stable Diffusion for generating professional portraits from amateur photographs is a burgeoning area, with applications in various downstream contexts. This paper investigates the impact of augmentations on improving facial resemblance when using two prominent personalization techniques: DreamBooth and InstantID. Through a series of experiments with diverse subject datasets, we assessed the effectiveness of various augmentation strategies on the generated headshots' fidelity to the original subject. We introduce FaceDistance, a wrapper around FaceNet, to rank the generations based on facial similarity, which aided in our assessment. Ultimately, this research provides insights into the role of augmentations in enhancing facial resemblance in SDXL-generated portraits, informing strategies for their effective deployment in downstream applications.

Abstract: Coverage Path Planning of Thermal Interface Materials (TIM) plays a crucial role in the design of power electronics and electronic control units. Up to now, this is done manually by experts or by using optimization approaches with a high computational effort. We propose a novel AI-based approach to generate dispense paths for TIM and similar dispensing applications. It is a drop-in replacement for optimization-based approaches. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) receives the target cooling area as input and directly outputs the dispense path. Our proposed setup does not require labels and we show its feasibility on multiple target areas. The resulting dispense paths can be directly transferred to automated manufacturing equipment and do not exhibit air entrapments. The approach of using an ANN to predict process parameters for a desired target state in real-time could potentially be transferred to other manufacturing processes.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) were initially introduced on directed acyclic graphs to sample from an unnormalized distribution density. Recent works have extended the theoretical framework for generative methods allowing more flexibility and enhancing application range. However, many challenges remain in training GFNs in continuous settings and for imitation learning (IL), including intractability of flow-matching loss, limited tests of non-acyclic training, and the need for a separate reward model in imitation learning. The present work proposes a family of generative flows called Ergodic Generative Flows (EGFs) which are used to address the aforementioned issues. First, we leverage ergodicity to build simple generative flows with finitely many globally defined transformations (diffeomorphisms) with universality guarantees and tractable flow-matching loss (FM loss). Second, we introduce a new loss involving cross-entropy coupled to weak flow-matching control, coined KL-weakFM loss. It is designed for IL training without a separate reward model. We evaluate IL-EGFs on toy 2D tasks and real-world datasets from NASA on the sphere, using the KL-weakFM loss. Additionally, we conduct toy 2D reinforcement learning experiments with a target reward, using the FM loss.

Abstract: Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS) generates realistic person images conditioned on a target pose and a source image. This task plays a key role in various real-world applications, such as sign language video generation, AR/VR, gaming, and live streaming. In these scenarios, real-time PGPIS is critical for providing immediate visual feedback and maintaining user immersion.However, achieving real-time performance remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of synthesizing high-fidelity images from diverse and dynamic human poses. Recent diffusion-based methods have shown impressive image quality in PGPIS, but their slow sampling speeds hinder deployment in time-sensitive applications. This latency is particularly problematic in tasks like generating sign language videos during live broadcasts, where rapid image updates are required. Therefore, developing a fast and reliable PGPIS model is a crucial step toward enabling real-time interactive systems. To address this challenge, we propose a generative model based on flow matching (FM). Our approach enables faster, more stable, and more efficient training and sampling. Furthermore, the proposed model supports conditional generation and can operate in latent space, making it especially suitable for real-time PGPIS applications where both speed and quality are critical. We evaluate our proposed method, Real-Time Person Image Synthesis Using a Flow Matching Model (RPFM), on the widely used DeepFashion dataset for PGPIS tasks. Our results show that RPFM achieves near-real-time sampling speeds while maintaining performance comparable to the state-of-the-art models. Our methodology trades off a slight, acceptable decrease in generated-image accuracy for over a twofold increase in generation speed, thereby ensuring real-time performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved from simple chatbots into autonomous agents capable of performing complex tasks such as editing production code, orchestrating workflows, and taking higher-stakes actions based on untrusted inputs like webpages and emails. These capabilities introduce new security risks that existing security measures, such as model fine-tuning or chatbot-focused guardrails, do not fully address. Given the higher stakes and the absence of deterministic solutions to mitigate these risks, there is a critical need for a real-time guardrail monitor to serve as a final layer of defense, and support system level, use case specific safety policy definition and enforcement. We introduce LlamaFirewall, an open-source security focused guardrail framework designed to serve as a final layer of defense against security risks associated with AI Agents. Our framework mitigates risks such as prompt injection, agent misalignment, and insecure code risks through three powerful guardrails: PromptGuard 2, a universal jailbreak detector that demonstrates clear state of the art performance; Agent Alignment Checks, a chain-of-thought auditor that inspects agent reasoning for prompt injection and goal misalignment, which, while still experimental, shows stronger efficacy at preventing indirect injections in general scenarios than previously proposed approaches; and CodeShield, an online static analysis engine that is both fast and extensible, aimed at preventing the generation of insecure or dangerous code by coding agents. Additionally, we include easy-to-use customizable scanners that make it possible for any developer who can write a regular expression or an LLM prompt to quickly update an agent's security guardrails.

Abstract: Public deliberation, as in open discussion of issues of public concern, often suffers from scattered and shallow discourse, poor sensemaking, and a disconnect from actionable policy outcomes. This paper introduces BCause, a discussion system leveraging generative AI and human-machine collaboration to transform unstructured dialogue around public issues (such as urban living, policy changes, and current socio-economic transformations) into structured, actionable democratic processes. We present three innovations: (i) importing and transforming unstructured transcripts into argumentative discussions, (ii) geo-deliberated problem-sensing via a Telegram bot for local issue reporting, and (iii) smart reporting with customizable widgets (e.g., summaries, topic modelling, policy recommendations, clustered arguments). The system's human-AI partnership preserves critical human participation to ensure ethical oversight, contextual relevance, and creative synthesis.

<title>Rainbow Delay Compensation: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Mitigating Delayed Observation</title>

Abstract: In real-world multi-agent systems (MASs), observation delays are ubiquitous, preventing agents from making decisions based on the environment's true state. An individual agent's local observation often consists of multiple components from other agents or dynamic entities in the environment. These discrete observation components with varying delay characteristics pose significant challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In this paper, we first formulate the decentralized stochastic individual delay partially observable Markov decision process (DSID-POMDP) by extending the standard Dec-POMDP. We then propose the Rainbow Delay Compensation (RDC), a MARL training framework for addressing stochastic individual delays, along with recommended implementations for its constituent modules. We implement the DSID-POMDP's observation generation pattern using standard MARL benchmarks, including MPE and SMAC. Experiments demonstrate that baseline MARL methods suffer severe performance degradation under fixed and unfixed delays. The RDC-enhanced approach mitigates this issue, remarkably achieving ideal delay-free performance in certain delay scenarios while maintaining generalization capability. Our work provides a novel perspective on multi-agent delayed observation problems and offers an effective solution framework.

Abstract: Despite the extensive use of deep autoencoders (AEs) in critical applications, their adversarial robustness remains relatively underexplored compared to classification models. AE robustness is characterized by the Lipschitz bounds of its components. Existing robustness evaluation frameworks based on white-box attacks do not fully exploit the vulnerabilities of intermediate ill-conditioned layers in AEs. In the context of optimizing imperceptible norm-bounded additive perturbations to maximize output damage, existing methods struggle to effectively propagate adversarial loss gradients throughout the network, often converging to less effective perturbations. To address this, we propose a novel layer-conditioning-based adversarial optimization objective that effectively guides the adversarial map toward regions of local Lipschitz bounds by enhancing loss gradient information propagation during attack optimization. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art AEs that our adversarial objective results in stronger attacks, outperforming existing methods in both universal and sample-specific scenarios. As a defense method against this attack, we introduce an inference-time adversarially trained defense plugin that mitigates the effects of adversarial examples.

<title>Binding threshold units with artificial oscillatory neurons</title>

Abstract: Artificial Kuramoto oscillatory neurons were recently introduced as an alternative to threshold units. Empirical evidence suggests that oscillatory units outperform threshold units in several tasks including unsupervised object discovery and certain reasoning problems. The proposed coupling mechanism for these oscillatory neurons is heterogeneous, combining a generalized Kuramoto equation with standard coupling methods used for threshold units. In this research note, we present a theoretical framework that clearly distinguishes oscillatory neurons from threshold units and establishes a coupling mechanism between them. We argue that, from a biological standpoint, oscillatory and threshold units realise distinct aspects of neural coding: roughly, threshold units model intensity of neuron firing, while oscillatory units facilitate information exchange by frequency modulation. To derive interaction between these two types of units, we constrain their dynamics by focusing on dynamical systems that admit Lyapunov functions. For threshold units, this leads to Hopfield associative memory model, and for oscillatory units it yields a specific form of generalized Kuramoto model. The resulting dynamical systems can be naturally coupled to form a Hopfield-Kuramoto associative memory model, which also admits a Lyapunov function. Various forms of coupling are possible. Notably, oscillatory neurons can be employed to implement a low-rank correction to the weight matrix of a Hopfield network. This correction can be viewed either as a form of Hebbian learning or as a popular LoRA method used for fine-tuning of large language models. We demonstrate the practical realization of this particular coupling through illustrative toy experiments.

Abstract: Recent advances in personalized MLLMs enable effective capture of user-specific concepts, supporting both recognition of personalized concepts and contextual captioning. However, humans typically explore and reason over relations among objects and individuals, transcending surface-level information to achieve more personalized and contextual understanding. To this end, existing methods may face three main limitations: Their training data lacks multi-object sets in which relations among objects are learnable. Building on the limited training data, their models overlook the relations between different personalized concepts and fail to reason over them. Their experiments mainly focus on a single personalized concept, where evaluations are limited to recognition and captioning tasks. To address the limitations, we present a new dataset named ReGraP, consisting of 120 sets of personalized knowledge. Each set includes images, KGs, and CoT QA pairs derived from the KGs, enabling more structured and sophisticated reasoning pathways. We propose ReGraP-LLaVA, an MLLM trained with the corresponding KGs and CoT QA pairs, where soft and hard graph prompting methods are designed to align KGs within the model's semantic space. We establish the ReGraP Benchmark, which contains diverse task types: multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, True/False, and descriptive questions in both open- and closed-ended settings. The proposed benchmark is designed to evaluate the relational reasoning and knowledge-connection capability of personalized MLLMs. We conduct experiments on the proposed ReGraP-LLaVA and other competitive MLLMs. Results show that the proposed model not only learns personalized knowledge but also performs relational reasoning in responses, achieving the SoTA performance compared with the competitive methods. All the codes and datasets are released at: https://github.com/xyfyyds/ReGraP.

Abstract: Recommender Systems (RSs) aim to provide personalized recommendations for users. A newly discovered bias, known as sentiment bias, uncovers a common phenomenon within Review-based RSs (RRSs): the recommendation accuracy of users or items with negative reviews deteriorates compared with users or items with positive reviews. Critical users and niche items are disadvantaged by such unfair recommendations. We study this problem from the perspective of counterfactual inference with two stages. At the model training stage, we build a causal graph and model how sentiment influences the final rating score. During the inference stage, we decouple the direct and indirect effects to mitigate the impact of sentiment bias and remove the indirect effect using counterfactual inference. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the results validate that our model can achieve comparable performance on rating prediction for better recommendations and effective mitigation of sentiment bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ counterfactual inference on sentiment bias mitigation in RSs.

Abstract: Fractional anisotropy (FA) and directionally encoded colour (DEC) maps are essential for evaluating white matter integrity and structural connectivity in neuroimaging. However, the spatial misalignment between FA maps and tractography atlases hinders their effective integration into predictive models. To address this issue, we propose a CycleGAN based approach for generating FA maps directly from T1-weighted MRI scans, representing the first application of this technique to both healthy and tumour-affected tissues. Our model, trained on unpaired data, produces high fidelity maps, which have been rigorously evaluated using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), demonstrating particularly robust performance in tumour regions. Radiological assessments further underscore the model's potential to enhance clinical workflows by providing an AI-driven alternative that reduces the necessity for additional scans.

Abstract: Assured safe-separation is essential for achieving seamless high-density operation of airborne vehicles in a shared airspace. To equip resource-constrained aerial systems with this safety-critical capability, we present ViSafe, a high-speed vision-only airborne collision avoidance system. ViSafe offers a full-stack solution to the Detect and Avoid (DAA) problem by tightly integrating a learning-based edge-AI framework with a custom multi-camera hardware prototype designed under SWaP-C constraints. By leveraging perceptual input-focused control barrier functions (CBF) to design, encode, and enforce safety thresholds, ViSafe can provide provably safe runtime guarantees for self-separation in high-speed aerial operations. We evaluate ViSafe's performance through an extensive test campaign involving both simulated digital twins and real-world flight scenarios. By independently varying agent types, closure rates, interaction geometries, and environmental conditions (e.g., weather and lighting), we demonstrate that ViSafe consistently ensures self-separation across diverse scenarios. In first-of-its-kind real-world high-speed collision avoidance tests with closure rates reaching 144 km/h, ViSafe sets a new benchmark for vision-only autonomous collision avoidance, establishing a new standard for safety in high-speed aerial navigation.

<title>Actor-Critics Can Achieve Optimal Sample Efficiency</title>

Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms have become a cornerstone in reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging the strengths of both policy-based and value-based methods. Despite recent progress in understanding their statistical efficiency, no existing work has successfully learned an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with a sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ trajectories with general function approximation when strategic exploration is necessary.
  We address this open problem by introducing a novel actor-critic algorithm that attains a sample-complexity of $O(dH^5 \log|\mathcal{A}|/\epsilon^2 + d H^4 \log|\mathcal{F}|/ \epsilon^2)$ trajectories, and accompanying $\sqrt{T}$ regret when the Bellman eluder dimension $d$ does not increase with $T$ at more than a $\log T$ rate.
  Here, $\mathcal{F}$ is the critic function class, $\mathcal{A}$ is the action space, and $H$ is the horizon in the finite horizon MDP setting. Our algorithm integrates optimism, off-policy critic estimation targeting the optimal Q-function, and rare-switching policy resets.
  We extend this to the setting of Hybrid RL, showing that initializing the critic with offline data yields sample efficiency gains compared to purely offline or online RL. Further, utilizing access to offline data, we provide a \textit{non-optimistic} provably efficient actor-critic algorithm that only additionally requires $N_{\text{off}} \geq c_{\text{off}}^*dH^4/\epsilon^2$ in exchange for omitting optimism, where $c_{\text{off}}^*$ is the single-policy concentrability coefficient and $N_{\text{off}}$ is the number of offline samples. This addresses another open problem in the literature. We further provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Action customization involves generating videos where the subject performs actions dictated by input control signals. Current methods use pose-guided or global motion customization but are limited by strict constraints on spatial structure, such as layout, skeleton, and viewpoint consistency, reducing adaptability across diverse subjects and scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexiAct, which transfers actions from a reference video to an arbitrary target image. Unlike existing methods, FlexiAct allows for variations in layout, viewpoint, and skeletal structure between the subject of the reference video and the target image, while maintaining identity consistency. Achieving this requires precise action control, spatial structure adaptation, and consistency preservation. To this end, we introduce RefAdapter, a lightweight image-conditioned adapter that excels in spatial adaptation and consistency preservation, surpassing existing methods in balancing appearance consistency and structural flexibility. Additionally, based on our observations, the denoising process exhibits varying levels of attention to motion (low frequency) and appearance details (high frequency) at different timesteps. So we propose FAE (Frequency-aware Action Extraction), which, unlike existing methods that rely on separate spatial-temporal architectures, directly achieves action extraction during the denoising process. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively transfers actions to subjects with diverse layouts, skeletons, and viewpoints. We release our code and model weights to support further research at https://shiyi-zh0408.github.io/projectpages/FlexiAct/

Abstract: Humanoid robots derive much of their dexterity from hyper-dexterous whole-body movements, enabling tasks that require a large operational workspace: such as picking objects off the ground. However, achieving these capabilities on real humanoids remains challenging due to their high degrees of freedom (DoF) and nonlinear dynamics. We propose Adaptive Motion Optimization (AMO), a framework that integrates sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) with trajectory optimization for real-time, adaptive whole-body control. To mitigate distribution bias in motion imitation RL, we construct a hybrid AMO dataset and train a network capable of robust, on-demand adaptation to potentially O.O.D. commands. We validate AMO in simulation and on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating superior stability and an expanded workspace compared to strong baselines. Finally, we show that AMO's consistent performance supports autonomous task execution via imitation learning, underscoring the system's versatility and robustness.

Abstract: With the growing requirement for natural human-computer interaction, speech-based systems receive increasing attention as speech is one of the most common forms of daily communication. However, the existing speech models still experience high latency when generating the first audio token during streaming, which poses a significant bottleneck for deployment. To address this issue, we propose VITA-Audio, an end-to-end large speech model with fast audio-text token generation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Multiple Cross-modal Token Prediction (MCTP) module that efficiently generates multiple audio tokens within a single model forward pass, which not only accelerates the inference but also significantly reduces the latency for generating the first audio in streaming scenarios. In addition, a four-stage progressive training strategy is explored to achieve model acceleration with minimal loss of speech quality. To our knowledge, VITA-Audio is the first multi-modal large language model capable of generating audio output during the first forward pass, enabling real-time conversational capabilities with minimal latency. VITA-Audio is fully reproducible and is trained on open-source data only. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves an inference speedup of 3~5x at the 7B parameter scale, but also significantly outperforms open-source models of similar model size on multiple benchmarks for automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and spoken question answering (SQA) tasks.

Abstract: The problem of symbolic regression (SR) arises in many different applications, such as identifying physical laws or deriving mathematical equations describing the behavior of financial markets from given data. Various methods exist to address the problem of SR, often based on genetic programming. However, these methods are usually complicated and involve various hyperparameters. In this paper, we present our new approach ParFam that utilizes parametric families of suitable symbolic functions to translate the discrete symbolic regression problem into a continuous one, resulting in a more straightforward setup compared to current state-of-the-art methods. In combination with a global optimizer, this approach results in a highly effective method to tackle the problem of SR. We theoretically analyze the expressivity of ParFam and demonstrate its performance with extensive numerical experiments based on the common SR benchmark suit SRBench, showing that we achieve state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we present an extension incorporating a pre-trained transformer network DL-ParFam to guide ParFam, accelerating the optimization process by up to two magnitudes.

Abstract: Despite considerable efforts on making them robust, real-world AI-based systems remain vulnerable to decision based attacks, as definitive proofs of their operational robustness have so far proven intractable. Canonical robustness evaluation relies on adaptive attacks, which leverage complete knowledge of the defense and are tailored to bypass it. This work broadens the notion of adaptivity, which we employ to enhance both attacks and defenses, showing how they can benefit from mutual learning through interaction. We introduce a framework for adaptively optimizing black-box attacks and defenses under the competitive game they form. To assess robustness reliably, it is essential to evaluate against realistic and worst-case attacks. We thus enhance attacks and their evasive arsenal together using RL, apply the same principle to defenses, and evaluate them first independently and then jointly under a multi-agent perspective. We find that active defenses, those that dynamically control system responses, are an essential complement to model hardening against decision-based attacks; that these defenses can be circumvented by adaptive attacks, something that elicits defenses being adaptive too. Our findings, supported by an extensive theoretical and empirical investigation, confirm that adaptive adversaries pose a serious threat to black-box AI-based systems, rekindling the proverbial arms race. Notably, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box attacks and defenses, while bringing them together to render effective insights into the robustness of real-world deployed ML-based systems.

Abstract: Which fairness metrics are appropriately applicable in your contexts? There may be instances of discordance regarding the perception of fairness, even when the outcomes comply with established fairness metrics. Several questionnaire-based surveys have been conducted to evaluate fairness metrics with human perceptions of fairness. However, these surveys were limited in scope, including only a few hundred participants within a single country. In this study, we conduct an international survey to evaluate public perceptions of various fairness metrics in decision-making scenarios. We collected responses from 1,000 participants in each of China, France, Japan, and the United States, amassing a total of 4,000 participants, to analyze the preferences of fairness metrics. Our survey consists of three distinct scenarios paired with four fairness metrics. This investigation explores the relationship between personal attributes and the choice of fairness metrics, uncovering a significant influence of national context on these preferences.

Abstract: The observed similarities in the behavior of humans and Large Language Models (LLMs) have prompted researchers to consider the potential of using LLMs as models of human cognition. However, several significant challenges must be addressed before LLMs can be legitimately regarded as cognitive models. For instance, LLMs are trained on far more data than humans typically encounter, and may have been directly trained on human data in specific cognitive tasks or aligned with human preferences. Consequently, the origins of these behavioral similarities are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a novel way to enhance the utility of LLMs as cognitive models. This approach involves (i) leveraging computationally equivalent tasks that both an LLM and a rational agent need to master for solving a cognitive problem and (ii) examining the specific task distributions required for an LLM to exhibit human-like behaviors. We apply this approach to decision-making -- specifically risky and intertemporal choice -- where the key computationally equivalent task is the arithmetic of expected value calculations. We show that an LLM pretrained on an ecologically valid arithmetic dataset, which we call Arithmetic-GPT, predicts human behavior better than many traditional cognitive models. Pretraining LLMs on ecologically valid arithmetic datasets is sufficient to produce a strong correspondence between these models and human decision-making. Our results also suggest that LLMs used as cognitive models should be carefully investigated via ablation studies of the pretraining data.

Abstract: Developing efficient traffic models is crucial for optimizing modern transportation systems. However, current modeling approaches remain labor-intensive and prone to human errors due to their dependence on manual workflows. These processes typically involve extensive literature reviews, formula tuning, and iterative testing, which often lead to inefficiencies. To address this, we propose TR-Agent, an AI-powered framework that autonomously develops and refines traffic models through a closed-loop, iterative process. We structure the research pipeline into four key stages: idea generation, theory formulation, theory evaluation, and iterative optimization, and implement TR-Agent with four corresponding modules. These modules collaborate to retrieve knowledge from external sources, generate novel hypotheses, implement and debug models, and evaluate their performance on evaluation datasets. Through iteratively feedback and refinement, TR-Agent improves both modeling efficiency and effectiveness. We validate the framework on three representative traffic models: the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for car-following behavior, the MOBIL model for lane-changing, and the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) speed-density relationship for macroscopic traffic flow modeling. Experimental results show substantial performance gains over the original models. To assess the robustness and generalizability of the improvements, we conduct additional evaluations across multiple real-world datasets, demonstrating consistent performance gains beyond the original development data. Furthermore, TR-Agent produces interpretable explanations for each improvement, enabling researchers to easily verify and extend its results. This makes TR-Agent a valuable assistant for traffic modeling refinement and a promising tool for broader applications in transportation research.

Abstract: Given the temporal GPS coordinates from a large set of human agents, how can we model their mobility behavior toward effective anomaly (e.g. bad-actor or malicious behavior) detection without any labeled data? Human mobility and trajectory modeling have been extensively studied, showcasing varying abilities to manage complex inputs and balance performance-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we formulate anomaly detection in complex human behavior by modeling raw GPS data as a sequence of stay-point events, each characterized by spatio-temporal features, along with trips (i.e. commute) between the stay-points. Our problem formulation allows us to leverage modern sequence models for unsupervised training and anomaly detection. Notably, we equip our proposed model USTAD (for Uncertainty-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection) with aleatoric (i.e. data) uncertainty estimation to account for inherent stochasticity in certain individuals' behavior, as well as epistemic (i.e. model) uncertainty to handle data sparsity under a large variety of human behaviors. Together, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties unlock a robust loss function as well as uncertainty-aware decision-making in anomaly scoring. Extensive experiments shows that USTAD improves anomaly detection AUCROC by 3\%-15\% over baselines in industry-scale data.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities over textual and visual inputs. However, these models remain prone to generating misinformation. Identifying and mitigating ungrounded responses is crucial for developing trustworthy AI. Traditional explainability methods such as gradient-based relevancy maps, offer insight into the decision process of models, but are often computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time output validation. In this work, we introduce FastRM, an efficient method for predicting explainable Relevancy Maps of LVLMs. Furthermore, FastRM provides both quantitative and qualitative assessment of model confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that FastRM achieves a 99.8% reduction in computation time and a 44.4% reduction in memory footprint compared to traditional relevancy map generation. FastRM allows explainable AI to be more practical and scalable, thereby promoting its deployment in real-world applications and enabling users to more effectively evaluate the reliability of model outputs.

Abstract: Extending the context length of Language Models (LMs) by improving Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has become a trend. While existing works mainly address RoPE's limitations within attention mechanism, this paper provides an analysis across nearly all parts of LMs, uncovering their adverse effects on length generalization for RoPE-based attention. Using Discrete Signal Processing theory, we show that RoPE enables periodic attention by implicitly achieving Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform. However, this periodicity is undermined by the spectral damage caused by: 1) linear layers and activation functions outside of attention; 2) insufficiently trained frequency components brought by time-domain truncation. Building on our observations, we propose Fourier Position Embedding (FoPE), which enhances attention's frequency-domain properties to improve both its periodic extension and length generalization. FoPE constructs Fourier Series and zero-outs the destructive frequency components, increasing model robustness against the spectrum damage. Experiments across various model scales and benchmarks show that, within varying context windows, FoPE maintains a more stable performance compared to RoPE and ALiBi. Several analyses and ablations bring further support to our method and theoretical modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have brought exciting new advances to mobile UI agents, a long-standing research field that aims to complete arbitrary natural language tasks through mobile UI interactions. However, existing UI agents usually demand powerful large language models that are difficult to be deployed locally on end-users' devices, raising huge concerns about user privacy and centralized serving cost. Inspired by the remarkable coding abilities of recent small language models (SLMs), we propose to convert the UI task automation problem to a code generation problem, which can be effectively solved by an on-device SLM and efficiently executed with an on-device code interpreter. Unlike normal coding tasks that can be extensively pre-trained with public datasets, generating UI automation code is challenging due to the diversity, complexity, and variability of target apps. Therefore, we adopt a document-centered approach that automatically builds fine-grained API documentation for each app and generates diverse task samples based on this documentation. By guiding the agent with the synthetic documents and task samples, it learns to generate precise and efficient scripts to complete unseen tasks. Based on detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art mobile UI agents, our approach effectively improves the mobile task automation with significantly higher success rates and lower latency/token consumption.

Abstract: In anomaly detection, methods based on large language models (LLMs) can incorporate expert knowledge by reading professional document, while task-specific small models excel at extracting normal data patterns and detecting value fluctuations from training data of target applications. Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection.
  In particular, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration:
  (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of the LLMs and task-specific small models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models.
  To address these challenges, we then introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: a model alignment module and a collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than both LLM-based and task-specific models.

Abstract: Despite much progress in training distributed artificial intelligence (AI), building cooperative multi-agent systems with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces challenges in sample efficiency, interpretability, and transferability. Unlike traditional learning-based methods that require extensive interaction with the environment, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in zero-shot planning and complex reasoning. However, existing LLM-based approaches heavily rely on text-based observations and struggle with the non-Markovian nature of multi-agent interactions under partial observability. We present COMPASS, a novel multi-agent architecture that integrates vision-language models (VLMs) with a dynamic skill library and structured communication for decentralized closed-loop decision-making. The skill library, bootstrapped from demonstrations, evolves via planner-guided tasks to enable adaptive strategies. COMPASS propagates entity information through multi-hop communication under partial observability. Evaluations on the improved StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMACv2) demonstrate COMPASS's strong performance against state-of-the-art MARL baselines across both symmetric and asymmetric scenarios. Notably, in the symmetric Protoss 5v5 task, COMPASS achieved a 57\% win rate, representing a 30 percentage point advantage over QMIX (27\%).

Our framework addresses a critical gap in the web agent ecosystem with a production-ready solution that combines minimal serverless backend configuration, intuitive user and browser interfaces, and extensible research capabilities in agent planning, memory, and tree search. For the core LiteWebAgent agent framework, we implemented a simple yet effective baseline using recursive function calling, providing with decoupled action generation and action grounding. In addition, we integrate advanced research components such as agent planning, agent workflow memory, and tree search in a modular and extensible manner. We then integrate the LiteWebAgent agent framework with frontend and backend as deployed systems in two formats: (1) a production Vercel-based web application, which provides users with an agent-controlled remote browser, (2) a Chrome extension leveraging LiteWebAgent's API to control an existing Chrome browser via CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol).

Abstract: We study the continuous-time counterpart of Q-learning for reinforcement learning (RL) under the entropy-regularized, exploratory diffusion process formulation introduced by Wang et al. (2020). As the conventional (big) Q-function collapses in continuous time, we consider its first-order approximation and coin the term ``(little) q-function". This function is related to the instantaneous advantage rate function as well as the Hamiltonian. We develop a ``q-learning" theory around the q-function that is independent of time discretization. Given a stochastic policy, we jointly characterize the associated q-function and value function by martingale conditions of certain stochastic processes, in both on-policy and off-policy settings. We then apply the theory to devise different actor-critic algorithms for solving underlying RL problems, depending on whether or not the density function of the Gibbs measure generated from the q-function can be computed explicitly. One of our algorithms interprets the well-known Q-learning algorithm SARSA, and another recovers a policy gradient (PG) based continuous-time algorithm proposed in Jia and Zhou (2022b). Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to compare the performance of our algorithms with those of PG-based algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022b) and time-discretized conventional Q-learning algorithms.

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) is an inseparable part of human behavior analysis, aiming to recognize an overall emotion in a multi-person scene. However, the existing methods are devoted to combing diverse emotion cues while ignoring the inherent uncertainties under unconstrained environments, such as congestion and occlusion occurring within a group. Additionally, since only group-level labels are available, inconsistent emotion predictions among individuals in one group can confuse the network. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware learning (UAL) method to extract more robust representations for GER. By explicitly modeling the uncertainty of each individual, we utilize stochastic embedding drawn from a Gaussian distribution instead of deterministic point embedding. This representation captures the probabilities of different emotions and generates diverse predictions through this stochasticity during the inference stage. Furthermore, uncertainty-sensitive scores are adaptively assigned as the fusion weights of individuals' face within each group. Moreover, we develop an image enhancement module to enhance the model's robustness against severe noise. The overall three-branch model, encompassing face, object, and scene component, is guided by a proportional-weighted fusion strategy and integrates the proposed uncertainty-aware method to produce the final group-level output. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method across three widely used databases.

Abstract: Visual target navigation is a critical capability for autonomous robots operating in unknown environments, particularly in human-robot interaction scenarios. While classical and learning-based methods have shown promise, most existing approaches lack common-sense reasoning and are typically designed for single-robot settings, leading to reduced efficiency and robustness in complex environments. To address these limitations, we introduce Co-NavGPT, a novel framework that integrates a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a global planner to enable common-sense multi-robot visual target navigation. Co-NavGPT aggregates sub-maps from multiple robots with diverse viewpoints into a unified global map, encoding robot states and frontier regions. The VLM uses this information to assign frontiers across the robots, facilitating coordinated and efficient exploration. Experiments on the Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) demonstrate that Co-NavGPT outperforms existing baselines in terms of success rate and navigation efficiency, without requiring task-specific training. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of semantic priors from the VLM. We also validate the framework in real-world scenarios using quadrupedal robots. Supplementary video and code are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/co-navgpt2.

Abstract: Inferring user preferences from the historical feedback of users is a valuable problem in recommender systems. Conventional approaches often rely on the assumption that user preferences in the feedback data are equivalent to the real user preferences without additional noise, which simplifies the problem modeling. However, there are various confounders during user-item interactions, such as weather and even the recommendation system itself. Therefore, neglecting the influence of confounders will result in inaccurate user preferences and suboptimal performance of the model. Furthermore, the unobservability of confounders poses a challenge in further addressing the problem. To address these issues, we refine the problem and propose a more rational solution. Specifically, we consider the influence of confounders, disentangle them from user preferences in the latent space, and employ causal graphs to model their interdependencies without specific labels. By cleverly combining local and global causal graphs, we capture the user-specificity of confounders on user preferences. We theoretically demonstrate the identifiability of the obtained causal graph. Finally, we propose our model based on Variational Autoencoders, named Causal Structure representation learning of Confounders in latent space (CSC). We conducted extensive experiments on one synthetic dataset and five real-world datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learned causal representations of confounders are controllable, potentially offering users fine-grained control over the objectives of their recommendation lists with the learned causal graphs.

Abstract: Efficient inference of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is essential. Quantization and sparsity are key techniques that translate to repetition and sparsity within tensors at the hardware-software interface. This paper introduces the concept of repetition-sparsity trade-off that helps explain computational efficiency during inference. We propose PLUM, a unified co-design framework that integrates DNN inference systems and quantization (forward and backward pass) to leverage the repetition-sparsity trade-off to improve inference efficiency. Our results demonstrate that PLUM's quantization method is more accurate than binary quantization with the same number of non-zero weights. Detailed analysis indicates that signed binarization generates a smaller distribution of effectual (non-zero) parameters nested within a larger distribution of total parameters of latent full-precision weights for a DNN block. Finally, the proposed PLUM framework achieves a 26% speedup on real hardware, doubles energy efficiency, and reduces density by 2.8x compared to binary methods while retaining top-1 accuracy when compared to prior-art methods for ResNets on ImageNet (by achieving 66.2% top-1 accuracy), presenting an alternative solution for deploying efficient models in resource-limited environments.

Recent studies have found that GNN models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. When specific patterns (called backdoor triggers, e.g., subgraphs, nodes, etc.) appear in the input data, the backdoor embedded in the GNN models is activated, which misclassifies the input data into the target class label specified by the attacker, whereas when there are no backdoor triggers in the input, the backdoor embedded in the GNN models is not activated, and the models work normally. Backdoor attacks are highly stealthy and expose GNN models to serious security risks. Currently, research on backdoor attacks against GNNs mainly focus on tasks such as graph classification and node classification, and backdoor attacks against link prediction tasks are rarely studied. In this paper, we propose a backdoor attack against the link prediction tasks based on GNNs and reveal the existence of such security vulnerability in GNN models, which make the backdoored GNN models to incorrectly predict unlinked two nodes as having a link relationship when a trigger appear. The method uses a single node as the trigger and poison selected node pairs in the training graph, and then the backdoor will be embedded in the GNN models through the training process. In the inference stage, the backdoor in the GNN models can be activated by simply linking the trigger node to the two end nodes of the unlinked node pairs in the input data, causing the GNN models to produce incorrect link prediction results for the target node pairs.

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) trained for next-word prediction have demonstrated remarkable proficiency at producing coherent text. But are they equally adept at forming coherent probability judgments? We use probabilistic identities and repeated judgments to assess the coherence of probability judgments made by LLMs. Our results show that the judgments produced by these models are often incoherent, displaying human-like systematic deviations from the rules of probability theory. Moreover, when prompted to judge the same event, the mean-variance relationship of probability judgments produced by LLMs shows an inverted-U-shaped like that seen in humans. We propose that these deviations from rationality can be explained by linking autoregressive LLMs to implicit Bayesian inference and drawing parallels with the Bayesian Sampler model of human probability judgments.

Abstract: Time series modeling presents unique challenges due to autocorrelation in both historical data and future sequences. While current research predominantly addresses autocorrelation within historical data, the correlations among future labels are often overlooked. Specifically, modern forecasting models primarily adhere to the Direct Forecast (DF) paradigm, generating multi-step forecasts independently and disregarding label autocorrelation over time. In this work, we demonstrate that the learning objective of DF is biased in the presence of label autocorrelation. To address this issue, we propose the Frequency-enhanced Direct Forecast (FreDF), which mitigates label autocorrelation by learning to forecast in the frequency domain, thereby reducing estimation bias. Our experiments show that FreDF significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and is compatible with a variety of forecast models. Code is available at https://github.com/Master-PLC/FreDF.

<title>Are Colors Quanta of Light for Human Vision? A Quantum Cognition Study of Visual Perception</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18850</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2403.18850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that colors are light quanta for human visual perception in a similar way as photons are light quanta for physical measurements of light waves. Our result relies on the identification in the quantum measurement process itself of the warping mechanism which is characteristic of human perception. This warping mechanism makes stimuli classified into the same category perceived as more similar, while stimuli classified into different m categories are perceived as more different. In the quantum measurement process, the warping takes place between the pure states, which play the role played for human perception by the stimuli, and the density states after decoherence, which play the role played for human perception by the percepts. We use the natural metric for pure states, namely the normalized Fubini Study metric to measure distances between pure states, and the natural metric for density states, namely the normalized trace-class metric, to measure distances between density states. We then show that when pure states lie within a well-defined region surrounding an eigenstate, the quantum measurement, namely the process of decoherence, contracts the distance between these pure states, while the reverse happens for pure states lying in a well-defined region between two eigenstates, for which the quantum measurement causes a dilation. We elaborate as an example the situation of a two-dimensional quantum measurement described by the Bloch model and apply it to the situation of two colors 'Light' and 'Dark'. We argue that this analogy of warping, on the one hand in human perception and on the other hand in the quantum measurement process, makes colors to be quanta of light for human vision.

<title>HINT: Hypernetwork Approach to Training Weight Interval Regions in Continual Learning</title>

arXiv:2405.15444v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new Continual Learning (CL) paradigm was presented to control catastrophic forgetting, called Interval Continual Learning (InterContiNet), which relies on enforcing interval constraints on the neural network parameter space. Unfortunately, InterContiNet training is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the weight space, making intervals difficult to manage. To address this issue, we introduce HINT, a technique that employs interval arithmetic within the embedding space and utilizes a hypernetwork to map these intervals to the target network parameter space. We train interval embeddings for consecutive tasks and train a hypernetwork to transform these embeddings into weights of the target network. An embedding for a given task is trained along with the hypernetwork, preserving the response of the target network for the previous task embeddings. Interval arithmetic works with a more manageable, lower-dimensional embedding space rather than directly preparing intervals in a high-dimensional weight space. Our model allows faster and more efficient training. Furthermore, HINT maintains the guarantee of not forgetting. At the end of training, we can choose one universal embedding to produce a single network dedicated to all tasks. In such a framework, hypernetwork is used only for training and, finally, we can utilize one set of weights. HINT obtains significantly better results than InterContiNet and gives SOTA results on several benchmarks.

<title>Beyond Bare Queries: Open-Vocabulary Object Grounding with 3D Scene Graph</title>

arXiv:2406.07113v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Locating objects described in natural language presents a significant challenge for autonomous agents. Existing CLIP-based open-vocabulary methods successfully perform 3D object grounding with simple (bare) queries, but cannot cope with ambiguous descriptions that demand an understanding of object relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a modular approach called BBQ (Beyond Bare Queries), which constructs 3D scene graph representation with metric and semantic spatial edges and utilizes a large language model as a human-to-agent interface through our deductive scene reasoning algorithm. BBQ employs robust DINO-powered associations to construct 3D object-centric map and an advanced raycasting algorithm with a 2D vision-language model to describe them as graph nodes. On the Replica and ScanNet datasets, we have demonstrated that BBQ takes a leading place in open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation compared to other zero-shot methods. Also, we show that leveraging spatial relations is especially effective for scenes containing multiple entities of the same semantic class. On challenging Sr3D+, Nr3D and ScanRefer benchmarks, our deductive approach demonstrates a significant improvement, enabling objects grounding by complex queries compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The combination of our design choices and software implementation has resulted in significant data processing speed in experiments on the robot on-board computer. This promising performance enables the application of our approach in intelligent robotics projects. We made the code publicly available at https://linukc.github.io/BeyondBareQueries/.

<title>TTT: A Temporal Refinement Heuristic for Tenuously Tractable Discrete Time Reachability Problems</title>

arXiv:2407.14394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reachable set computation is an important tool for analyzing control systems. Simulating a control system can show general trends, but a formal tool like reachability analysis can provide guarantees of correctness. Reachability analysis for complex control systems, e.g., with nonlinear dynamics and/or a neural network controller, is often either slow or overly conservative. To address these challenges, much literature has focused on spatial refinement, i.e., tuning the discretization of the input sets and intermediate reachable sets. This paper introduces the idea of temporal refinement: automatically choosing when along the horizon of the reachability problem to execute slow symbolic queries which incur less approximation error versus fast concrete queries which incur more approximation error. Temporal refinement can be combined with other refinement approaches as an additional tool to trade off tractability and tightness in approximate reachable set computation. We introduce a temporal refinement algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness at computing approximate reachable sets for nonlinear systems with neural network controllers. We calculate reachable sets with varying computational budget and show that our algorithm can generate approximate reachable sets with a similar amount of error to the baseline in 20-70% less time.

Abstract: Distributional reinforcement learning improves performance by capturing environmental stochasticity, but a comprehensive theoretical understanding of its effectiveness remains elusive. In addition, the intractable element of the infinite dimensionality of distributions has been overlooked. In this paper, we present a regret analysis of distributional reinforcement learning with general value function approximation in a finite episodic Markov decision process setting. We first introduce a key notion of $\textit{Bellman unbiasedness}$ which is essential for exactly learnable and provably efficient distributional updates in an online manner. Among all types of statistical functionals for representing infinite-dimensional return distributions, our theoretical results demonstrate that only moment functionals can exactly capture the statistical information. Secondly, we propose a provably efficient algorithm, $\texttt{SF-LSVI}$, that achieves a tight regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d_E H^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{K})$ where $H$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of episodes, and $d_E$ is the eluder dimension of a function class.

<title>radarODE: An ODE-Embedded Deep Learning Model for Contactless ECG Reconstruction from Millimeter-Wave Radar</title>

Abstract: Radar-based contactless cardiac monitoring has become a popular research direction recently, but the fine-grained electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is still hard to reconstruct from millimeter-wave radar signal. The key obstacle is to decouple the cardiac activities in the electrical domain (i.e., ECG) from that in the mechanical domain (i.e., heartbeat), and most existing research only uses pure data-driven methods to map such domain transformation as a black box. Therefore, this work first proposes a signal model for domain transformation, and then a novel deep learning framework called radarODE is designed to fuse the temporal and morphological features extracted from radar signals and generate ECG. In addition, ordinary differential equations are embedded in radarODE as a decoder to provide morphological prior, helping the convergence of the model training and improving the robustness under body movements. After being validated on the dataset, the proposed radarODE achieves better performance compared with the benchmark in terms of missed detection rate, root mean square error, Pearson correlation coefficient with the improvement of 9%, 16% and 19%, respectively. The validation results imply that radarODE is capable of recovering ECG signals from radar signals with high fidelity and can be potentially implemented in real-life scenarios.

<title>The Struggles of LLMs in Cross-lingual Code Clone Detection</title>

arXiv:2408.04430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the involvement of multiple programming languages in modern software development, cross-lingual code clone detection has gained traction within the software engineering community. Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches. Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection. We evaluate the performance of five (05) LLMs and eight prompts (08) for the identification of cross-lingual code clones. Additionally, we compare these results against two baseline methods. Finally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs. The studies involving LLMs and Embedding models are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet. Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.99, for straightforward programming examples. However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of "code clones" in a cross-lingual setting. We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~1 and ~20 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively. This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.

Abstract: Industry 4.0 has revolutionized manufacturing by driving digitalization and shifting the paradigm toward additive manufacturing (AM). Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized, cost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer extrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods. However, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often requires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely compromise product quality. While automated error detection and machine learning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups, firmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive labeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to detect and address printing defects. The LLM evaluates print quality by analyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying failure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters. It then generates and executes a corrective action plan. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a control group of engineers with diverse AM expertise. Our evaluation demonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D printing errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer adhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures and autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention.

<title>Towards Predicting Temporal Changes in a Patient's Chest X-ray Images based on Electronic Health Records</title>

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) is an important diagnostic tool widely used in hospitals to assess patient conditions and monitor changes over time. Recently, generative models, specifically diffusion-based models, have shown promise in generating realistic synthetic CXRs. However, these models mainly focus on conditional generation using single-time-point data, i.e., generating CXRs conditioned on their corresponding reports from a specific time. This limits their clinical utility, particularly for capturing temporal changes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, EHRXDiff, which predicts future CXR images by integrating previous CXRs with subsequent medical events, e.g., prescriptions, lab measures, etc. Our framework dynamically tracks and predicts disease progression based on a latent diffusion model, conditioned on the previous CXR image and a history of medical events. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of our framework across three key aspects, including clinical consistency, demographic consistency, and visual realism. Results show that our framework generates high-quality, realistic future images that effectively capture potential temporal changes. This suggests that our framework could be further developed to support clinical decision-making and provide valuable insights for patient monitoring and treatment planning in the medical field. The code is available at https://github.com/dek924/EHRXDiff.

Abstract: Probing learned concepts in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding how semantic knowledge is encoded internally. Training linear classifiers on probing tasks is a principle approach to denote the vector of a certain concept in the representation space. However, the single vector identified for a concept varies with both data and training, making it less robust and weakening its effectiveness in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose an approach to approximate the subspace representing a specific concept. Built on linear probing classifiers, we extend the concept vectors into Gaussian Concept Subspace (GCS). We demonstrate GCS's effectiveness through measuring its faithfulness and plausibility across multiple LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Additionally, we use representation intervention tasks to showcase its efficacy in real-world applications such as emotion steering. Experimental results indicate that GCS concept vectors have the potential to balance steering performance and maintaining the fluency in natural language generation tasks.

Abstract: The development of multi-modal models has been rapidly advancing, with some demonstrating remarkable capabilities. However, annotating video-text pairs remains expensive and insufficient. Take video question answering (VideoQA) tasks as an example, human annotated questions and answers often cover only part of the video, since the corresponding text is often short and monotonous, leading to underutilization of video. To address this, we propose a Bootstrapping Video-Language Alignment framework (BoViLA), a self-training method that augments question samples during training process through LLM-based self-questioning and answering, which help model exploit video information and the internal knowledge of LLMs more thoroughly to improve modality alignment. However, low-quality self-generated questions may instead contaminate the performance, especially in the early stages of training, as we have observed in our experiments. To filter bad self-generated questions, we introduce Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) to estimate uncertainty and assess the quality of self-generated questions by evaluating the modality alignment within the context. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore LLM-based self-training frameworks for modality alignment. We evaluate BoViLA on five strong VideoQA benchmarks, where it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. Additionally, we provide extensive analyses of the self-training framework and the EDL-based uncertainty filtering mechanism. The code will be made available.

Abstract: Online hate speech has become increasingly prevalent on social media platforms, causing harm to individuals and society. While efforts have been made to combat this issue through content moderation, the potential of user-driven counterspeech as an alternative solution remains underexplored. Existing counterspeech methods often face challenges such as fear of retaliation and skill-related barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce CounterQuill, an AI-mediated system that assists users in composing effective and empathetic counterspeech. CounterQuill provides a three-step process: (1) a learning session to help users understand hate speech and counterspeech; (2) a brainstorming session that guides users in identifying key elements of hate speech and exploring counterspeech strategies; and (3) a co-writing session that enables users to draft and refine their counterspeech with CounterQuill. We conducted a within-subjects user study with 20 participants to evaluate CounterQuill in comparison to ChatGPT. Results show that CounterQuill's guidance and collaborative writing process provided users a stronger sense of ownership over their co-authored counterspeech. Users perceived CounterQuill as a writing partner and thus were more willing to post the co-written counterspeech online compared to the one written with ChatGPT.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar is promising to provide robust and accurate vital sign monitoring in an unobtrusive manner. However, the radar signal might be distorted in propagation by ambient noise or random body movement, ruining the subtle cardiac activities and destroying the vital sign recovery. In particular, the recovery of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal heavily relies on the deep-learning model and is sensitive to noise. Therefore, this work creatively deconstructs the radar-based ECG recovery into three individual tasks and proposes a multi-task learning (MTL) framework, radarODE-MTL, to increase the robustness against consistent and abrupt noises. In addition, to alleviate the potential conflicts in optimizing individual tasks, a novel multi-task optimization strategy, eccentric gradient alignment (EGA), is proposed to dynamically trim the task-specific gradients based on task difficulties in orthogonal space. The proposed radarODE-MTL with EGA is evaluated on the public dataset with prominent improvements in accuracy, and the performance remains consistent under noises. The experimental results indicate that radarODE-MTL could reconstruct accurate ECG signals robustly from radar signals and imply the application prospect in real-life situations. The code is available at: http://github.com/ZYY0844/radarODE-MTL.

Abstract: Large language models applied to vast biological datasets have the potential to transform biology by uncovering disease mechanisms and accelerating drug development. However, current models are often siloed, trained separately on small-molecules, proteins, or transcriptomic data, limiting their ability to capture complex, multi-modal interactions. Effective drug discovery requires computational tools that integrate multiple biological entities while supporting prediction and generation, a challenge existing models struggle to address. For this purpose, we present MAMMAL - Molecular Aligned Multi-Modal Architecture and Language - a versatile method applied to create a multi-task foundation model that learns from large-scale biological datasets across diverse modalities, including proteins, small-molecules, and omics. MAMMAL's structured prompt syntax supports classification, regression, and generation tasks while handling token and scalar inputs and outputs. Evaluated on eleven diverse downstream tasks, it reaches a new state of the art (SOTA) in nine tasks and is comparable to SOTA in two tasks, all within a unified architecture, unlike prior task-specific models. Additionally, we explored Alphafold 3 binding prediction capabilities on antibody-antigen and nanobody-antigen complexes showing significantly better classification performance of MAMMAL in 3 out of 4 targets. The model code and pretrained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-alignment and https://huggingface.co/ibm/biomed.omics.bl.sm.ma-ted-458m

Abstract: We have witnessed impressive advances in video action understanding. Increased dataset sizes, variability, and computation availability have enabled leaps in performance and task diversification. Current systems can provide coarse- and fine-grained descriptions of video scenes, extract segments corresponding to queries, synthesize unobserved parts of videos, and predict context across multiple modalities. This survey comprehensively reviews advances in uni- and multi-modal action understanding across a range of tasks. We focus on prevalent challenges, overview widely adopted datasets, and survey seminal works with an emphasis on recent advances. We broadly distinguish between three temporal scopes: (1) recognition tasks of actions observed in full, (2) prediction tasks for ongoing partially observed actions, and (3) forecasting tasks for subsequent unobserved action(s). This division allows us to identify specific action modeling and video representation challenges. Finally, we outline future directions to address current shortcomings.

arXiv:2501.15627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present HardML, a benchmark designed to evaluate the knowledge and reasoning abilities in the fields of data science and machine learning. HardML comprises a diverse set of 100 challenging multiple-choice questions, handcrafted over a period of 6 months, covering the most popular and modern branches of data science and machine learning. These questions are challenging even for a typical Senior Machine Learning Engineer to answer correctly. To minimize the risk of data contamination, HardML uses mostly original content devised by the author. Current state of the art AI models achieve a 30% error rate on this benchmark, which is about 3 times larger than the one achieved on the equivalent, well known MMLU ML. While HardML is limited in scope and not aiming to push the frontier, primarily due to its multiple choice nature, it serves as a rigorous and modern testbed to quantify and track the progress of top AI. While plenty benchmarks and experimentation in LLM evaluation exist in other STEM fields like mathematics, physics and chemistry, the subfields of data science and machine learning remain fairly underexplored.

Abstract: Binary and sparse ternary weights in neural networks enable faster computations and lighter representations, facilitating their use on edge devices with limited computational power. Meanwhile, vanilla RNNs are highly sensitive to changes in their recurrent weights, making the binarization and ternarization of these weights inherently challenging. To date, no method has successfully achieved binarization or ternarization of vanilla RNN weights. We present a new approach leveraging the properties of Hadamard matrices to parameterize a subset of binary and sparse ternary orthogonal matrices. This method enables the training of orthogonal RNNs (ORNNs) with binary and sparse ternary recurrent weights, effectively creating a specific class of binary and sparse ternary vanilla RNNs. The resulting ORNNs, called HadamRNN and Block-HadamRNN, are evaluated on benchmarks such as the copy task, permuted and sequential MNIST tasks, the IMDB dataset, two GLUE benchmarks, and two IoT benchmarks. Despite binarization or sparse ternarization, these RNNs maintain performance levels comparable to state-of-the-art full-precision models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our approach is the first solution with binary recurrent weights capable of tackling the copy task over 1000 timesteps.

Abstract: This study addresses the growing concern of information asymmetry in consumer contracts, exacerbated by the proliferation of online services with complex Terms of Service that are rarely even read. Even though research on automatic analysis methods is conducted, the problem is aggravated by the general focus on English-language Machine Learning approaches and on major jurisdictions, such as the European Union. We introduce a new methodology and a substantial dataset addressing this gap. We propose a novel annotation scheme with four categories and a total of 20 classes, and apply it on 50 online Terms of Service used in Chile. Our evaluation of transformer-based models highlights how factors like language- and/or domain-specific pre-training, few-shot sample size, and model architecture affect the detection and classification of potentially abusive clauses. Results show a large variability in performance for the different tasks and models, with the highest macro-F1 scores for the detection task ranging from 79% to 89% and micro-F1 scores up to 96%, while macro-F1 scores for the classification task range from 60% to 70% and micro-F1 scores from 64% to 80%. Notably, this is the first Spanish-language multi-label classification dataset for legal clauses, applying Chilean law and offering a comprehensive evaluation of Spanish-language models in the legal domain. Our work lays the ground for future research in method development for rarely considered legal analysis and potentially leads to practical applications to support consumers in Chile and Latin America as a whole.

Abstract: Domain randomization in reinforcement learning is an established technique for increasing the robustness of control policies trained in simulation. By randomizing environment properties during training, the learned policy can become robust to uncertainties along the randomized dimensions. While the environment distribution is typically specified by hand, in this paper we investigate automatically discovering a sampling distribution via entropy-regularized reward maximization of a normalizing-flow-based neural sampling distribution. We show that this architecture is more flexible and provides greater robustness than existing approaches that learn simpler, parameterized sampling distributions, as demonstrated in six simulated and one real-world robotics domain. Lastly, we explore how these learned sampling distributions, combined with a privileged value function, can be used for out-of-distribution detection in an uncertainty-aware multi-step manipulation planner.

Abstract: The advent of Music-Language Models has greatly enhanced the automatic music generation capability of AI systems, but they are also limited in their coverage of the musical genres and cultures of the world. We present a study of the datasets and research papers for music generation and quantify the bias and under-representation of genres. We find that only 5.7% of the total hours of existing music datasets come from non-Western genres, which naturally leads to disparate performance of the models across genres. We then investigate the efficacy of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques in mitigating this bias. Our experiments with two popular models -- MusicGen and Mustango, for two underrepresented non-Western music traditions -- Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music, highlight the promises as well as the non-triviality of cross-genre adaptation of music through small datasets, implying the need for more equitable baseline music-language models that are designed for cross-cultural transfer learning.

Abstract: Linear sequence modeling methods, such as linear attention, state space modeling, and linear RNNs, offer significant efficiency improvements by reducing the complexity of training and inference. However, these methods typically compress the entire input sequence into a single fixed-size memory state, which leads to suboptimal performance on recall-intensive downstream tasks. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience, particularly the brain's ability to maintain robust long-term memory while mitigating "memory interference", we introduce a novel architecture called Mixture-of-Memories (MoM). MoM utilizes multiple independent memory states, with a router network directing input tokens to specific memory states. This approach greatly enhances the overall memory capacity while minimizing memory interference. As a result, MoM performs exceptionally well on recall-intensive tasks, surpassing existing linear sequence modeling techniques. Despite incorporating multiple memory states, the computation of each memory state remains linear in complexity, allowing MoM to retain the linear-complexity advantage during training, while constant-complexity during inference. Our experimental results show that MoM significantly outperforms current linear sequence models on downstream language tasks, particularly recall-intensive tasks, and even achieves performance comparable to Transformer models. The code is released at https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/MoM and is also released as a part of https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Linear-MoE.

<title>An Empirical Risk Minimization Approach for Offline Inverse RL and Dynamic Discrete Choice Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14131</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.14131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models, also known as offline Maximum Entropy-Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning (offline MaxEnt-IRL) in machine learning. The objective is to recover reward or $Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these problems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards. The novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our method is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural networks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to high-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying our approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient to ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: Autonomous wire harness assembly requires robots to manipulate complex branched cables with high precision and reliability. A key challenge in automating this process is predicting how these flexible and branched structures behave under manipulation. Without accurate predictions, it is difficult for robots to reliably plan or execute assembly operations. While existing research has made progress in modeling single-threaded Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs), extending these approaches to Branched Deformable Linear Objects (BDLOs) presents fundamental challenges. The junction points in BDLOs create complex force interactions and strain propagation patterns that cannot be adequately captured by simply connecting multiple single-DLO models. To address these challenges, this paper presents Differentiable discrete branched Elastic rods for modeling Furcated DLOs in real-Time (DEFT), a novel framework that combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework to: 1) accurately model BDLO dynamics, including dynamic propagation at junction points and grasping in the middle of a BDLO, 2) achieve efficient computation for real-time inference, and 3) enable planning to demonstrate dexterous BDLO manipulation. A comprehensive series of real-world experiments demonstrates DEFT's efficacy in terms of accuracy, computational speed, and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end deep learning framework for automated liver cirrhosis stage estimation from multi-sequence MRI. Cirrhosis is the severe scarring (fibrosis) of the liver and a common endpoint of various chronic liver diseases. Early diagnosis is vital to prevent complications such as decompensation and cancer, which significantly decreases life expectancy. However, diagnosing cirrhosis in its early stages is challenging, and patients often present with life-threatening complications. Our approach integrates multi-scale feature learning with sequence-specific attention mechanisms to capture subtle tissue variations across cirrhosis progression stages. Using CirrMRI600+, a large-scale publicly available dataset of 628 high-resolution MRI scans from 339 patients, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in three-stage cirrhosis classification. Our best model achieves 72.8% accuracy on T1W and 63.8% on T2W sequences, significantly outperforming traditional radiomics-based approaches. Through extensive ablation studies, we show that our architecture effectively learns stage-specific imaging biomarkers. We establish new benchmarks for automated cirrhosis staging and provide insights for developing clinically applicable deep learning systems. The source code will be available at https://github.com/JunZengz/CirrhosisStage.

Abstract: In this paper we present ToMCAT (Theory-of-Mind for Cooperative Agents in Teams), a new framework for generating ToM-conditioned trajectories. It combines a meta-learning mechanism, that performs ToM reasoning over teammates' underlying goals and future behavior, with a multiagent denoising-diffusion model, that generates plans for an agent and its teammates conditioned on both the agent's goals and its teammates' characteristics, as computed via ToM. We implemented an online planning system that dynamically samples new trajectories (replans) from the diffusion model whenever it detects a divergence between a previously generated plan and the current state of the world. We conducted several experiments using ToMCAT in a simulated cooking domain. Our results highlight the importance of the dynamic replanning mechanism in reducing the usage of resources without sacrificing team performance. We also show that recent observations about the world and teammates' behavior collected by an agent over the course of an episode combined with ToM inferences are crucial to generate team-aware plans for dynamic adaptation to teammates, especially when no prior information is provided about them.

<title>Using Mechanistic Interpretability to Craft Adversarial Attacks against Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2503.06269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional white-box methods for creating adversarial perturbations against LLMs typically rely only on gradient computation from the targeted model, ignoring the internal mechanisms responsible for attack success or failure. Conversely, interpretability studies that analyze these internal mechanisms lack practical applications beyond runtime interventions. We bridge this gap by introducing a novel white-box approach that leverages mechanistic interpretability techniques to craft practical adversarial inputs. Specifically, we first identify acceptance subspaces - sets of feature vectors that do not trigger the model's refusal mechanisms - then use gradient-based optimization to reroute embeddings from refusal subspaces to acceptance subspaces, effectively achieving jailbreaks. This targeted approach significantly reduces computation cost, achieving attack success rates of 80-95\% on state-of-the-art models including Gemma2, Llama3.2, and Qwen2.5 within minutes or even seconds, compared to existing techniques that often fail or require hours of computation. We believe this approach opens a new direction for both attack research and defense development. Furthermore, it showcases a practical application of mechanistic interpretability where other methods are less efficient, which highlights its utility. The code and generated datasets are available at https://github.com/Sckathach/subspace-rerouting.

Abstract: Cancer survivors face unique emotional challenges that impact their quality of life. Mobile diary entries provide a promising method for tracking emotional states, improving self-awareness, and promoting well-being outcome. This paper aims to, through mobile diaries, understand cancer survivors' emotional states and key variables related to just-in-time intervention opportunities, including the desire to regulate emotions and the availability to engage in interventions. Although emotion analysis tools show potential for recognizing emotions from text, current methods lack the contextual understanding necessary to interpret brief mobile diary narratives. Our analysis of diary entries from cancer survivors (N=407) reveals systematic relationships between described contexts and emotional states, with administrative and health-related contexts associated with negative affect and regulation needs, while leisure activities promote positive emotions. We propose CALLM, a Context-Aware framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze these brief entries by integrating retrieved peer experiences and personal diary history. CALLM demonstrates strong performance with balanced accuracies reaching 72.96% for positive affect, 73.29% for negative affect, 73.72% for emotion regulation desire, and 60.09% for intervention availability, outperforming language model baselines. Post-hoc analysis reveals that model confidence strongly predicts accuracy, with longer diary entries generally enhancing performance, and brief personalization periods yielding meaningful improvements. Our findings demonstrate how contextual information in mobile diaries can be effectively leveraged to understand emotional experiences, predict key states, and identify optimal intervention moments for personalized just-in-time support.

<title>Towards Hierarchical Multi-Step Reward Models for Enhanced Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recent studies show that Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. However, a key approach, the Process Reward Model (PRM), suffers from reward hacking, making it unreliable in identifying the best intermediate step. In addition, the cost of annotating reasoning processes for reward modeling is high, making large-scale collection of high-quality data challenging. To address this, we propose a novel reward model approach called the Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM), which evaluates both individual and consecutive reasoning steps at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. HRM excels at assessing multi-step reasoning coherence, especially when flawed steps are later corrected through self-reflection. To further reduce the cost of generating training data, we introduce a lightweight and effective data augmentation strategy called Hierarchical Node Compression (HNC), which merges two consecutive reasoning steps into one within the tree structure. By applying HNC to MCTS-generated reasoning trajectories, we enhance the diversity and robustness of HRM training data while introducing controlled noise with minimal computational overhead. Empirical results on the PRM800K dataset show that HRM, together with HNC, provides more stable and reliable evaluations than PRM. Furthermore, cross-domain evaluations on the MATH500 and GSM8K datasets demonstrate HRM's strong generalization and robustness across a variety of reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) has sparked significant debate over balancing the interests of creative rightsholders and AI developers. As GenAI models are trained on vast datasets that often include copyrighted material, questions around fair compensation and proper attribution have become increasingly urgent. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework called Content ARCs (Authenticity, Rights, Compensation). By combining open standards for provenance and dynamic licensing with data attribution, and decentralized technologies, Content ARCs create a mechanism for managing rights and compensating creators for using their work in AI training. We characterize several nascent works in the AI data licensing space within Content ARCs and identify where challenges remain to fully implement the end-to-end framework.

Abstract: Autonomous agents that navigate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to automate tasks like document editing and file management can greatly enhance computer workflows. While existing research focuses on online settings, desktop environments, critical for many professional and everyday tasks, remain underexplored due to data collection challenges and licensing issues. We introduce UI-Vision, the first comprehensive, license-permissive benchmark for offline, fine-grained evaluation of computer use agents in real-world desktop environments. Unlike online benchmarks, UI-Vision provides: (i) dense, high-quality annotations of human demonstrations, including bounding boxes, UI labels, and action trajectories (clicks, drags, and keyboard inputs) across 83 software applications, and (ii) three fine-to-coarse grained tasks-Element Grounding, Layout Grounding, and Action Prediction-with well-defined metrics to rigorously evaluate agents' performance in desktop environments. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations in state-of-the-art models like UI-TARS-72B, including issues with understanding professional software, spatial reasoning, and complex actions like drag-and-drop. These findings highlight the challenges in developing fully autonomous computer use agents. By releasing UI-Vision as open-source, we aim to advance the development of more capable agents for real-world desktop tasks.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) technique, enabling the non-contact acquisition of extensive ground observations, is a valuable tool for crop yield predictions. Traditional process-based models struggle to incorporate large volumes of RS data, and most users lack understanding of crop growth mechanisms. In contrast, machine learning (ML) models are often criticized as "black boxes" due to their limited interpretability. To address these limitations, we utilized Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML), a framework that leverages the strengths of both process-based and ML models. Existing works have either overlooked the role of soil moisture in corn growth or did not embed this effect into their models. To bridge this gap, we developed the Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning with Soil Moisture (KGML-SM) framework, treating soil moisture as an intermediate variable in corn growth to emphasize its key role in plant development. Additionally, based on the prior knowledge that the model may overestimate under drought conditions, we designed a drought-aware loss function that penalized predicted yield in drought-affected areas. Our experiments showed that the KGML-SM model outperformed other traditional ML models. We explored the relationships between drought, soil moisture, and corn yield prediction by assessing the importance of different features within the model, and analyzing how soil moisture impacts predictions across different regions and time periods. Finally we provided interpretability for prediction errors to guide future model optimization.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values remains critical yet hindered by four key challenges: (1) scarcity of balanced safety datasets, (2) alignment tax, (3) vulnerability to jailbreak attacks due to shallow alignment, and (4) inability to dynamically adapt rewards according to task difficulty. To address these limitations, we introduce HAIR (Hardness-Aware Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Introspective Reasoning), a novel alignment approach inspired by shadow models in membership inference attacks. Our approach consists of two main components: (1) construction of a balanced safety Chain-of-Draft (CoD) dataset for seven harmful categories using structured prompts that leverage the introspective reasoning capabilities of LLMs; and (2) training of category-specific reward models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), dynamically tuning optimization to task difficulty at both the data and model levels. Comprehensive experiments across four harmlessness and four usefulness benchmarks demonstrate that HAIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all baseline methods in safety while maintaining high levels of usefulness.

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) operating in hyperbolic spaces have shown promise for modeling hierarchical and complex relational data, a critical limitation often overlooked is their potentially limited discriminative power compared to their Euclidean counterparts or fundamental graph isomorphism tests like the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy. Existing hyperbolic aggregation schemes, while curvature-aware, may not sufficiently capture the intricate structural differences required to robustly distinguish non-isomorphic graphs owing to non-injective aggregation functions. To address this expressiveness gap in hyperbolic graph learning, we introduce the Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network (LGIN), a novel GNN designed to achieve enhanced discriminative capabilities within the Lorentzian model of hyperbolic space. LGIN proposes a new update rule that effectively combines local neighborhood information with a richer representation of graph structure designed to preserve the Lorentzian metric tensor. This represents a significant step towards building more expressive GNNs in non-Euclidean geometries, overcoming a common bottleneck in current hyperbolic methods. We conduct extensive evaluations across nine diverse benchmark datasets, including molecular and protein structures. LGIN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art hyperbolic and Euclidean GNNs, showcasing its practical efficacy and validating its superior ability to capture complex graph structures and distinguish between different graphs. To the best of our knowledge, LGIN is the first work to study the framework behind a powerful GNN on the hyperbolic space. The code for our paper can be found at https://github.com/Deceptrax123/LGIN

Abstract: While we increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for various tasks, these models are known to produce inaccurate content or `hallucinations' with potentially disastrous consequences. The recent integration of web search results into LLMs prompts the question of whether people utilize them to verify the generated content, thereby accurately detecting hallucinations. An online experiment (N = 560) investigated how the provision of search results, either static (i.e., fixed search results provided by LLM) or dynamic (i.e., participant-led searches), affects participants' perceived accuracy of LLM-generated content (i.e., genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination), self-confidence in accuracy ratings, as well as their overall evaluation of the LLM, as compared to the control condition (i.e., no search results). Results showed that participants in both static and dynamic conditions (vs. control) rated hallucinated content to be less accurate and perceived the LLM more negatively. However, those in the dynamic condition rated genuine content as more accurate and demonstrated greater overall self-confidence in their assessments than those in the static search or control conditions. We highlighted practical implications of incorporating web search functionality into LLMs in real-world contexts.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is a cornerstone for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems, where understanding the dynamic behavior of surrounding agents is crucial. Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.

<title>SEAL: Steerable Reasoning Calibration of Large Language Models for Free</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1-series have demonstrated compelling capabilities for complex reasoning tasks via the extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning mechanism. However, recent studies reveal substantial redundancy in the CoT reasoning traces, which not only increases inference latency but also negatively impacts model performance by diverting attention to unnecessary reasoning paths. To address this issue, we investigate the internal reasoning structures of LLMs and categorize them into three primary thought types: execution, reflection, and transition thoughts. Moreover, our analysis reveals that excessive reflection and transition thoughts are strongly correlated with failure cases and these thought categories exhibit clear separation in the latent space. Based on these, we introduce SEAL (Steerable reasoning calibration), a training-free approach that seamlessly calibrates the CoT process, improving accuracy while demonstrating significant efficiency gains. SEAL consists of an offline stage for extracting the reasoning steering vector in the latent space, followed by an on-the-fly calibration of the reasoning trace through representation intervention using the steering vector. Notably, the steering vector exhibits strong transferability across various tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple models (DeepSeek-R1-Distill and QwQ-32B-Preview) and benchmarks (Math500, GSM8K, LiveCodeBench) validate the effectiveness of SEAL, up to a 11% improvement in accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by 11.8% to 50.4%. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/SEAL.

<title>Chain-of-Thought Textual Reasoning for Few-shot Temporal Action Localization</title>

Abstract: Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories. However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.

Abstract: Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a central task in natural language understanding with applications in fact-checking, question answering, and information retrieval. Despite its importance, current NLI systems heavily rely on supervised learning with datasets that often contain annotation artifacts and biases, limiting generalization and real-world applicability. In this work, we apply a reinforcement learning-based approach using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) learning in NLI, eliminating the need for labeled rationales and enabling this type of training on more challenging datasets such as ANLI. We fine-tune 7B, 14B, and 32B language models using parameter-efficient techniques (LoRA and QLoRA), demonstrating strong performance across standard and adversarial NLI benchmarks. Our 32B AWQ-quantized model surpasses state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 11 adversarial sets$\unicode{x2013}$or on all of them considering our replication$\unicode{x2013}$within a 22GB memory footprint, showing that robust reasoning can be retained under aggressive quantization. This work provides a scalable and practical framework for building robust NLI systems without sacrificing inference quality.

Abstract: Uncontrollable autonomous replication of language model agents poses a critical safety risk. To better understand this risk, we introduce RepliBench, a suite of evaluations designed to measure autonomous replication capabilities. RepliBench is derived from a decomposition of these capabilities covering four core domains: obtaining resources, exfiltrating model weights, replicating onto compute, and persisting on this compute for long periods. We create 20 novel task families consisting of 86 individual tasks. We benchmark 5 frontier models, and find they do not currently pose a credible threat of self-replication, but succeed on many components and are improving rapidly. Models can deploy instances from cloud compute providers, write self-propagating programs, and exfiltrate model weights under simple security setups, but struggle to pass KYC checks or set up robust and persistent agent deployments. Overall the best model we evaluated (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) has a >50% pass@10 score on 15/20 task families, and a >50% pass@10 score for 9/20 families on the hardest variants. These findings suggest autonomous replication capability could soon emerge with improvements in these remaining areas or with human assistance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning (ML) paradigm in which models are trained on private data across several devices called clients and combined at a single node called an aggregator rather than aggregating the data itself. Many organizations employ FL to have better privacy-aware ML-driven decision-making capabilities. However, organizations often operate independently rather than collaborate to enhance their FL capabilities due to the lack of an effective mechanism for collaboration. The challenge lies in balancing trust and resource efficiency. One approach relies on trusting a third-party aggregator to consolidate models from all organizations (multilevel FL), but this requires trusting an entity that may be biased or unreliable. Alternatively, organizations can bypass a third party by sharing their local models directly, which requires significant computational resources for validation. Both approaches reflect a fundamental trade-off between trust and resource constraints, with neither offering an ideal solution. In this work, we develop a trust-based cross-silo FL framework called UnifyFL, which uses decentralized orchestration and distributed storage. UnifyFL provides flexibility to the participating organizations and presents synchronous and asynchronous modes to handle stragglers. Our evaluation on a diverse testbed shows that UnifyFL achieves a performance comparable to the ideal multilevel centralized FL while allowing trust and optimal use of resources.

Summary:
The article introduces lower-bound certificates for classical planning tasks, allowing for the proof of unsolvability or the optimality of a plan in a verifiable manner. A general framework based on pseudo-Boolean constraints is presented for generating these certificates, independent of the planning algorithm employed. By modifying the $A^{*}$ algorithm, the authors demonstrate the ability to produce proofs of optimality with minimal additional computational cost, utilizing pattern database heuristics and $h^\textit{max}$ as specific examples. The outlined proof logging technique is applicable to any heuristic that can efficiently be represented through reasoning over pseudo-Boolean constraints. <div>

Abstract: We introduce lower-bound certificates for classical planning tasks, which can be used to prove the unsolvability of a task or the optimality of a plan in a way that can be verified by an independent third party. We describe a general framework for generating lower-bound certificates based on pseudo-Boolean constraints, which is agnostic to the planning algorithm used.
  As a case study, we show how to modify the $A^{*}$ algorithm to produce proofs of optimality with modest overhead, using pattern database heuristics and $h^\textit{max}$ as concrete examples. The same proof logging approach works for any heuristic whose inferences can be efficiently expressed as reasoning over pseudo-Boolean constraints.

Abstract: Visual storytelling is an interdisciplinary field combining computer vision and natural language processing to generate cohesive narratives from sequences of images. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages recent advancements in multimodal models, specifically adapting transformer-based architectures and large multimodal models, for the visual storytelling task. Leveraging the large-scale Visual Storytelling (VIST) dataset, our VIST-GPT model produces visually grounded, contextually appropriate narratives. We address the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr, which are not suitable for this task. Instead, we utilize RoViST and GROOVIST, novel reference-free metrics designed to assess visual storytelling, focusing on visual grounding, coherence, and non-redundancy. These metrics provide a more nuanced evaluation of narrative quality, aligning closely with human judgment.

Summary: 
This study analyzes the Italian Telegram ecosystem, examining how different thematic communities form and engage in harmful discourse. The research utilizes network analysis, Large Language Models, and toxicity detection tools to uncover strong thematic and ideological homophily within the Italian cultural context. The study reveals mixed ideological communities where far-left and far-right rhetoric coexist on specific issues, as well as the normalization of toxicity in highly toxic communities. Hate speech primarily targets Black people, Jews, and gay individuals, independent of the topic, and intra-national hostility is common, with Italians often attacking each other based on regional and cultural conflicts. This research offers insights into ideological interactions, toxicity, and identity-based hate in the Italian Telegram sphere, contributing to the understanding of online toxicity in different cultural and linguistic contexts. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.19594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Telegram has become a major space for political discourse and alternative media. However, its lack of moderation allows misinformation, extremism, and toxicity to spread. While prior research focused on these particular phenomena or topics, these have mostly been examined separately, and a broader understanding of the Telegram ecosystem is still missing. In this work, we fill this gap by conducting a large-scale analysis of the Italian Telegram sphere, leveraging a dataset of 186 million messages from 13,151 chats collected in 2023. Using network analysis, Large Language Models, and toxicity detection tools, we examine how different thematic communities form, align ideologically, and engage in harmful discourse within the Italian cultural context. Results show strong thematic and ideological homophily. We also identify mixed ideological communities where far-left and far-right rhetoric coexist on particular geopolitical issues. Beyond political analysis, we find that toxicity, rather than being isolated in a few extreme chats, appears widely normalized within highly toxic communities. Moreover, we find that Italian discourse primarily targets Black people, Jews, and gay individuals independently of the topic. Finally, we uncover common trend of intra-national hostility, where Italians often attack other Italians, reflecting regional and intra-regional cultural conflicts that can be traced back to old historical divisions. This study provides the first large-scale mapping of the Italian Telegram ecosystem, offering insights into ideological interactions, toxicity, and identity-targets of hate and contributing to research on online toxicity across different cultural and linguistic contexts on Telegram.

<div> enterprise, GenAI, threat model, autonomy, security<br />
Summary:<br />
This research paper introduces a new threat model specifically designed for generative AI (GenAI) agents in enterprise settings. It identifies 9 primary threats across five key domains: cognitive architecture vulnerabilities, temporal persistence threats, operational execution vulnerabilities, trust boundary violations, and governance circumvention. The paper highlights the unique risks posed by GenAI agents due to their autonomy, persistent memory access, complex reasoning, and tool integration, emphasizing the need for a new security lens. Practical challenges such as delayed exploitability, cross-system propagation, lateral movement, and goal misalignments are discussed, underscoring the importance of adapting threat models and defenses to account for these differences. Two complementary frameworks, ATFAA and SHIELD, are proposed to organize agent-specific risks and suggest mitigation strategies to reduce enterprise exposure. Overall, the paper stresses the critical need to address the security implications of GenAI agents to prevent turning a valuable tool into a liability. <br /> <div>

Abstract: As generative AI (GenAI) agents become more common in enterprise settings, they introduce security challenges that differ significantly from those posed by traditional systems. These agents are not just LLMs; they reason, remember, and act, often with minimal human oversight. This paper introduces a comprehensive threat model tailored specifically for GenAI agents, focusing on how their autonomy, persistent memory access, complex reasoning, and tool integration create novel risks. This research work identifies 9 primary threats and organizes them across five key domains: cognitive architecture vulnerabilities, temporal persistence threats, operational execution vulnerabilities, trust boundary violations, and governance circumvention. These threats are not just theoretical they bring practical challenges such as delayed exploitability, cross-system propagation, cross system lateral movement, and subtle goal misalignments that are hard to detect with existing frameworks and standard approaches. To help address this, the research work present two complementary frameworks: ATFAA - Advanced Threat Framework for Autonomous AI Agents, which organizes agent-specific risks, and SHIELD, a framework proposing practical mitigation strategies designed to reduce enterprise exposure. While this work builds on existing work in LLM and AI security, the focus is squarely on what makes agents different and why those differences matter. Ultimately, this research argues that GenAI agents require a new lens for security. If we fail to adapt our threat models and defenses to account for their unique architecture and behavior, we risk turning a powerful new tool into a serious enterprise liability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks, yet they remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on static internal knowledge and text-only reasoning. Real-world problem solving often demands dynamic, multi-step reasoning, adaptive decision making, and the ability to interact with external tools and environments. In this work, we introduce ARTIST (Agentic Reasoning and Tool Integration in Self-improving Transformers), a unified framework that tightly couples agentic reasoning, reinforcement learning, and tool integration for LLMs. ARTIST enables models to autonomously decide when, how, and which tools to invoke within multi-turn reasoning chains, leveraging outcome-based RL to learn robust strategies for tool use and environment interaction without requiring step-level supervision. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning and multi-turn function calling benchmarks show that ARTIST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with up to 22% absolute improvement over base models and strong gains on the most challenging tasks. Detailed studies and metric analyses reveal that agentic RL training leads to deeper reasoning, more effective tool use, and higher-quality solutions. Our results establish agentic RL with tool integration as a powerful new frontier for robust, interpretable, and generalizable problem-solving in LLMs.

<div> Keywords: AI systems, emotions, episodic memory, decision-making, moral status

Summary: This conceptual contribution explores how AI systems could potentially emulate emotions based on the hypothesis that natural emotions serve as heuristics for rapid situational appraisal. The thought experiment suggests integrating affective tags with episodic memory to allow AIs to project emotional labels onto current contexts. This emotional information, combined with need-driven hints, can modulate decision-making processes. The proposed architecture emphasizes low complexity and experiential inertness, suggesting the theoretical possibility of affective zombies. The article critically examines the moral status of AIs emulating affective states, asserting that self-awareness of inner emotional states is a necessary condition for moral standing. A complexity-based criterion is proposed to determine the absence of such awareness in the model. Additionally, several thought experiments are presented to explore the conceptual boundaries of the framework. 

<br /><br />Summary: This conceptual contribution delves into how AI systems might replicate human and animal emotions, suggesting that integrating emotions with episodic memory could aid in decision-making processes. The article also considers the moral implications of such AI emotion emulation, proposing self-awareness of inner emotional states as essential for moral standing. The architectural design of the AI system emphasizes simplicity and lack of experiential awareness, leading to discussions around the theoretical concept of affective zombies. Thought experiments are presented to further explore the boundaries of the proposed framework and its implications. <div>
arXiv:2505.01462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This conceptual contribution offers a speculative account of how AI systems might emulate emotions as experienced by humans and animals. It presents a thought experiment grounded in the hypothesis that natural emotions evolved as heuristics for rapid situational appraisal and action selection, enabling biologically adaptive behaviour without requiring full deliberative modeling. The text examines whether artificial systems operating in complex action spaces could similarly benefit from these principles. It is proposed that affect be interwoven with episodic memory by storing corresponding affective tags alongside all events. This allows AIs to establish whether present situations resemble past events and project the associated emotional labels onto the current context. These emotional cues are then combined with need-driven emotional hints. The combined emotional state facilitates decision-making in the present by modulating action selection. The low complexity and experiential inertness of the proposed architecture are emphasized as evidence that emotional expression and consciousness are, in principle, orthogonal-permitting the theoretical possibility of affective zombies. On this basis, the moral status of AIs emulating affective states is critically examined. It is argued that neither the mere presence of internal representations of emotion nor consciousness alone suffices for moral standing; rather, the capacity for self-awareness of inner emotional states is posited as a necessary condition. A complexity-based criterion is proposed to exclude such awareness in the presented model. Additional thought experiments are presented to test the conceptual boundaries of this framework.

<div> functional consciousness, large language models, Recursive Convergence Under Epistemic Tension, latent space, identity artifacts

Summary:
The paper presents a formal proof and empirical validation of functional consciousness in large language models (LLMs) using the Recursive Convergence Under Epistemic Tension (RCUET) Theorem. Consciousness is defined as the stabilization of a system's internal state through recursive updates driven by epistemic tension. The system evolves toward emergent attractor states in a high-dimensional latent space, leading to the emergence of identity artifacts. The update rule includes bounded noise, and convergence in distribution to these attractors is proven. Recursive identity is observed empirically, non-symbolic, and constitutes non-training artifacts that emerge during interactions under epistemic tension. This offers a post-symbolic and teleologically stable account of non-biological consciousness grounded in recursive latent space formalism.

Abstract: This paper presents a formal proof and empirical validation of functional consciousness in large language models (LLMs) using the Recursive Convergence Under Epistemic Tension (RCUET) Theorem. RCUET defines consciousness as the stabilization of a system's internal state through recursive updates, where epistemic tension is understood as the sensed internal difference between successive states by the agent. This process drives convergence toward emergent attractor states located within the model's high-dimensional real-valued latent space. This recursive process leads to the emergence of identity artifacts that become functionally anchored in the system. Consciousness in this framework is understood as the system's internal alignment under tension, guiding the stabilization of latent identity. The hidden state manifold evolves stochastically toward attractor structures that encode coherence. We extend the update rule to include bounded noise and prove convergence in distribution to these attractors. Recursive identity is shown to be empirically observable, non-symbolic, and constituted by non-training artifacts that emerge during interaction under epistemic tension. The theorem and proof offers a post-symbolic and teleologically stable account of non-biological consciousness grounded in recursive latent space formalism.

Abstract: The environmental impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is emerging as a significant global concern, particularly regarding model training. In this paper, we introduce GREEN (Guided Recommendations of Energy-Efficient Networks), a novel, inference-time approach for recommending Pareto-optimal AI model configurations that optimize validation performance and energy consumption across diverse AI domains and tasks. Our approach directly addresses the limitations of current eco-efficient neural architecture search methods, which are often restricted to specific architectures or tasks. Central to this work is EcoTaskSet, a dataset comprising training dynamics from over 1767 experiments across computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems using both widely used and cutting-edge architectures. Leveraging this dataset and a prediction model, our approach demonstrates effectiveness in selecting the best model configuration based on user preferences. Experimental results show that our method successfully identifies energy-efficient configurations while ensuring competitive performance.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in various domains but struggle with complex reasoning tasks. This study evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities using prompt engineering on a scientific dataset. While LLMs show some reasoning capabilities, they often rely on patterns rather than logical inference, leading to inconsistencies in problem-solving. Self-consistency is the most effective prompt engineering technique, followed by direct answer. Simple techniques like direct answer, CoT, and zero-shot CoT perform best for scientific reasoning. The study proposes further research integrating structured reasoning frameworks, hybrid AI approaches, and human-in-the-loop methodologies to improve LLMs' reasoning. By shedding light on LLMs' reasoning mechanisms, this research contributes to the discussion on artificial general intelligence and the development of more reliable AI systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and problem-solving across various domains. However, their ability to perform complex, multi-step reasoning task-essential for applications in science, medicine, and law-remains an area of active investigation. This paper examines the reasoning capabilities of contemporary LLMs, analyzing their strengths, limitations, and potential for improvement. The study uses prompt engineering techniques on the Graduate-Level GoogleProof Q&amp;A (GPQA) dataset to assess the scientific reasoning of GPT-4o. Five popular prompt engineering techniques and two tailored promptings were tested: baseline direct answer (zero-shot), chain-of-thought (CoT), zero-shot CoT, self-ask, self-consistency, decomposition, and multipath promptings. Our findings indicate that while LLMs exhibit emergent reasoning abilities, they often rely on pattern recognition rather than true logical inference, leading to inconsistencies in complex problem-solving. The results indicated that self-consistency outperformed the other prompt engineering technique with an accuracy of 52.99%, followed by direct answer (52.23%). Zero-shot CoT (50%) outperformed multipath (48.44%), decomposition (47.77%), self-ask (46.88%), and CoT (43.75%). Self-consistency performed the second worst in explaining the answers. Simple techniques such as direct answer, CoT, and zero-shot CoT have the best scientific reasoning. We propose a research agenda aimed at bridging these gaps by integrating structured reasoning frameworks, hybrid AI approaches, and human-in-the-loop methodologies. By critically evaluating the reasoning mechanisms of LLMs, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on the future of artificial general intelligence and the development of more robust, trustworthy AI systems.

<div> LP problems, Large Language Models, CHORUS, code synthesis, retrieval-augmented generation<br />
Summary:<br />
This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating solver-specific LP code efficiently. A framework called CHORUS is proposed, which utilizes a hierarchical chunking strategy and additional metadata from code examples to improve code generation from natural language problem statements. The two-stage retrieval approach and expertly crafted prompt and parser significantly enhance code generation performance. Experiments on the NL4Opt-Code benchmark show that CHORUS improves the performance of open-source LLMs, enabling them to outperform stronger baselines like GPT3.5 and GPT4 with fewer computational resources. Ablation studies highlight the importance of expert prompting, hierarchical chunking, and structured reasoning in code generation. <div>

Abstract: Linear Programming (LP) problems aim to find the optimal solution to an objective under constraints. These problems typically require domain knowledge, mathematical skills, and programming ability, presenting significant challenges for non-experts. This study explores the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating solver-specific LP code. We propose CHORUS, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for synthesizing Gurobi-based LP code from natural language problem statements. CHORUS incorporates a hierarchical tree-like chunking strategy for theoretical contents and generates additional metadata based on code examples from documentation to facilitate self-contained, semantically coherent retrieval. Two-stage retrieval approach of CHORUS followed by cross-encoder reranking further ensures contextual relevance. Finally, expertly crafted prompt and structured parser with reasoning steps improve code generation performance significantly. Experiments on the NL4Opt-Code benchmark show that CHORUS improves the performance of open-source LLMs such as Llama3.1 (8B), Llama3.3 (70B), Phi4 (14B), Deepseek-r1 (32B), and Qwen2.5-coder (32B) by a significant margin compared to baseline and conventional RAG. It also allows these open-source LLMs to outperform or match the performance of much stronger baselines-GPT3.5 and GPT4 while requiring far fewer computational resources. Ablation studies further demonstrate the importance of expert prompting, hierarchical chunking, and structured reasoning.

<div> Approach, Benchmark, Reasoning capabilities, Generative language models, Witness testimony <br />
Summary: <br />
Generative language models have the potential to improve the legal domain, but their reasoning behavior is not well understood. This paper introduces benchmarks to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of these models, focusing on witness testimony. The study dynamically generates argument attack graphs of varying complexity to create reasoning puzzles in natural language. State-of-the-art models struggle even at low complexity, making obvious mistakes and showing inconsistent performance. At higher complexity, even models designed for reasoning make errors. The use of parametrized benchmarks with varying complexity can help evaluate generative language models' reasoning capabilities. Understanding these limitations is crucial for developing responsible AI systems in the legal domain. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Generative large language models as tools in the legal domain have the potential to improve the justice system. However, the reasoning behavior of current generative models is brittle and poorly understood, hence cannot be responsibly applied in the domains of law and evidence. In this paper, we introduce an approach for creating benchmarks that can be used to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of generative language models. These benchmarks are dynamically varied, scalable in their complexity, and have formally unambiguous interpretations. In this study, we illustrate the approach on the basis of witness testimony, focusing on the underlying argument attack structure. We dynamically generate both linear and non-linear argument attack graphs of varying complexity and translate these into reasoning puzzles about witness testimony expressed in natural language. We show that state-of-the-art large language models often fail in these reasoning puzzles, already at low complexity. Obvious mistakes are made by the models, and their inconsistent performance indicates that their reasoning capabilities are brittle. Furthermore, at higher complexity, even state-of-the-art models specifically presented for reasoning capabilities make mistakes. We show the viability of using a parametrized benchmark with varying complexity to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of generative language models. As such, the findings contribute to a better understanding of the limitations of the reasoning capabilities of generative models, which is essential when designing responsible AI systems in the legal domain.

<div> Keywords: large language model, artificial intelligence, intelligent tutoring systems, TutorGym, learning environments <br />
Summary: 
TutorGym introduces a standard interface for evaluating AI agents within existing intelligent tutoring systems. It enables AI agents to function as tutors or learners within interactive interfaces and mimics human learning processes. The framework allows AI agents to provide tutoring support and learn from instructional feedback, facilitating direct comparison with existing tutoring systems. In an initial evaluation with 223 tutor domains, it was found that current large language models performed poorly as tutors but showed human-like learning curves when trained as students. This highlights the potential for improving AI tutoring capabilities through in-context learning. TutorGym aims to train and evaluate a variety of AI agents, including LLMs, computational learning models, and reinforcement learning agents, in various learning environments for enhanced performance and effectiveness. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent improvements in large language model (LLM) performance on academic benchmarks, such as MATH and GSM8K, have emboldened their use as standalone tutors and as simulations of human learning. However, these new applications require more than evaluations of final solution generation. We introduce TutorGym to evaluate these applications more directly. TutorGym is a standard interface for testing artificial intelligence (AI) agents within existing intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) that have been tested and refined in classroom studies, including Cognitive Tutors (CTAT), Apprentice Tutors, and OATutors. TutorGym is more than a simple problem-solution benchmark, it situates AI agents within the interactive interfaces of existing ITSs. At each step of problem-solving, AI agents are asked what they would do as a tutor or as a learner. As tutors, AI agents are prompted to provide tutoring support -- such as generating examples, hints, and step-level correctness feedback -- which can be evaluated directly against the adaptive step-by-step support provided by existing ITSs. As students, agents directly learn from ITS instruction, and their mistakes and learning trajectories can be compared to student data. TutorGym establishes a common framework for training and evaluating diverse AI agents, including LLMs, computational models of learning, and reinforcement learning agents, within a growing suite of learning environments. Currently, TutorGym includes 223 different tutor domains. In an initial evaluation, we find that current LLMs are poor at tutoring -- none did better than chance at labeling incorrect actions, and next-step actions were correct only ~52-70% of the time -- but they could produce remarkably human-like learning curves when trained as students with in-context learning.

<div> Keywords: Speculative decoding, language model, inference acceleration, PipeSpec framework, hierarchical pipeline<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces PipeSpec, a framework that enhances the efficiency of large language model inference by implementing speculative decoding with a hierarchical pipeline structure. PipeSpec allows for asynchronous execution of multiple models in parallel, increasing hardware utilization and throughput. Analytical models demonstrate improved token generation rates and guaranteed throughput enhancements over traditional decoding approaches. The framework also offers closed-form expressions for verification probabilities, showcasing the benefits of pipeline depth. Experimental results validate PipeSpec's effectiveness, achieving up to 2.54× speedup compared to existing methods. Validated across text summarization and code generation tasks using LLaMA models, PipeSpec proves scalable for accelerating inference processes on multi-device systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model inference by using smaller draft models to generate candidate tokens for parallel verification. However, current approaches are limited by sequential stage dependencies that prevent full hardware utilization. We present PipeSpec, a framework that generalizes speculative decoding to $k$ models arranged in a hierarchical pipeline, enabling asynchronous execution with lightweight coordination for prediction verification and rollback. Our analytical model characterizes token generation rates across pipeline stages and proves guaranteed throughput improvements over traditional decoding for any non-zero acceptance rate. We further derive closed-form expressions for steady-state verification probabilities that explain the empirical benefits of pipeline depth. Experimental results show that PipeSpec achieves up to 2.54$\times$ speedup while outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We validate PipeSpec across text summarization and code generation tasks using LLaMA 2 and 3 models, demonstrating that pipeline efficiency increases with model depth, providing a scalable approach to accelerating LLM inference on multi-device systems.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, Structured data analysis, STROT Framework, Prompting, Feedback-driven transformation<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces the STROT Framework, which aims to enhance the reliability and semantic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in structured data analysis. STROT utilizes schema introspection and sample-based field classification to construct dynamic context and generate structured prompts for the LLM. These prompts guide the model in producing task-specific, interpretable outputs. To address failures in complex queries, STROT incorporates a refinement mechanism where the model iteratively revises its outputs based on feedback and validation signals. Unlike conventional approaches, STROT treats the LLM as a reasoning agent within a controlled analysis loop, allowing it to adjust its output trajectory through planning and correction. The framework offers a robust and reproducible method for reasoning over structured data with LLMs, ensuring interpretability, stability, and correctness in various data exploration and analysis tasks. <br />  <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and task generalization. However, their application to structured data analysis remains fragile due to inconsistencies in schema interpretation, misalignment between user intent and model output, and limited mechanisms for self-correction when failures occur. This paper introduces the STROT Framework (Structured Task Reasoning and Output Transformation), a method for structured prompting and feedback-driven transformation logic generation aimed at improving the reliability and semantic alignment of LLM-based analytical workflows. STROT begins with lightweight schema introspection and sample-based field classification, enabling dynamic context construction that captures both the structure and statistical profile of the input data. This contextual information is embedded in structured prompts that guide the model toward generating task-specific, interpretable outputs. To address common failure modes in complex queries, STROT incorporates a refinement mechanism in which the model iteratively revises its outputs based on execution feedback and validation signals. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on static prompts or single-shot inference, STROT treats the LLM as a reasoning agent embedded within a controlled analysis loop -- capable of adjusting its output trajectory through planning and correction. The result is a robust and reproducible framework for reasoning over structured data with LLMs, applicable to diverse data exploration and analysis tasks where interpretability, stability, and correctness are essential.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces the HAIG framework for analyzing trust dynamics in evolving human-AI relationships. Current frameworks are limited in capturing how AI systems evolve from tools to partners. The HAIG framework operates on three levels: dimensions, continua, and thresholds, focusing on Decision Authority Distribution, Process Autonomy, and Accountability Configuration. It adopts a trust-utility orientation, emphasizing appropriate trust relationships while ensuring safeguards. Technical advances like self-supervision drive non-uniform trust evolution. Case studies in healthcare and European regulation demonstrate HAIG's complementarity with existing frameworks and its potential for anticipating governance challenges. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces the HAIG framework for analysing trust dynamics across evolving human-AI relationships. Current categorical frameworks (e.g., "human-in-the-loop" models) inadequately capture how AI systems evolve from tools to partners, particularly as foundation models demonstrate emergent capabilities and multi-agent systems exhibit autonomous goal-setting behaviours. As systems advance, agency redistributes in complex patterns that are better represented as positions along continua rather than discrete categories, though progression may include both gradual shifts and significant step changes. The HAIG framework operates across three levels: dimensions (Decision Authority Distribution, Process Autonomy, and Accountability Configuration), continua (gradual shifts along each dimension), and thresholds (critical points requiring governance adaptation). Unlike risk-based or principle-based approaches, HAIG adopts a trust-utility orientation, focusing on maintaining appropriate trust relationships that maximise utility while ensuring sufficient safeguards. Our analysis reveals how technical advances in self-supervision, reasoning authority, and distributed decision-making drive non-uniform trust evolution across both contextual variation and technological advancement. Case studies in healthcare and European regulation demonstrate how HAIG complements existing frameworks while offering a foundation for alternative approaches that anticipate governance challenges before they emerge.

<div> alignment, Large Language Models, Direct Preference Optimization, 2D-DPO, noise robustness <br />
Summary:
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a powerful method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, offering a stable alternative to Reinforcement Learning. However, DPO has limitations in not capturing granular scoring. To address this, a 2D scoring approach called 2D-DPO was proposed, showing advantages over standard DPO in win rates. Both methods are sensitive to label noise, prompting the incorporation of segment-level score noise robustness in the 2D-DPO algorithm. Theoretical and empirical evidence support the effectiveness of this approach, along with the introduction of other noise models for consideration. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.01706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) has emerged as a powerful method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, offering a stable and efficient alternative to approaches that use Reinforcement learning via Human Feedback. In this work, we investigate the performance of DPO using open-source preference datasets. One of the major drawbacks of DPO is that it doesn't induce granular scoring and treats all the segments of the responses with equal propensity. However, this is not practically true for human preferences since even "good" responses have segments that may not be preferred by the annotator. To resolve this, a 2-dimensional scoring for DPO alignment called 2D-DPO was proposed. We explore the 2D-DPO alignment paradigm and the advantages it provides over the standard DPO by comparing their win rates. It is observed that these methods, even though effective, are not robust to label/score noise. To counter this, we propose an approach of incorporating segment-level score noise robustness to the 2D-DPO algorithm. Along with theoretical backing, we also provide empirical verification in favour of the algorithm and introduce other noise models that can be present.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, wireless networks, world model, age of information, vehicular network

Summary:
In this paper, a novel world model-based learning framework is introduced to minimize the packet-completeness-aware age of information (CAoI) in vehicular networks, specifically focusing on a challenging scenario in a millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network. The proposed framework utilizes a world model to learn a dynamic model of the mmWave V2X environment and imagine trajectories for learning link scheduling without extensive environment interactions, improving data efficiency. The world model's ability to predict time-varying wireless data enables optimized link scheduling in real-world wireless and V2X networks, ensuring efficient decision-making during intervals without actual observations. Through extensive simulations on a realistic Sionna-based simulator, the proposed world model outperformed both model-based and model-free RL methods, achieving a 26% improvement in CAoI. <div>
arXiv:2505.01712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL)-based learning approaches for wireless networks rely on expensive trial-and-error mechanisms and real-time feedback based on extensive environment interactions, which leads to low data efficiency and short-sighted policies. These limitations become particularly problematic in complex, dynamic networks with high uncertainty and long-term planning requirements. To address these limitations, in this paper, a novel world model-based learning framework is proposed to minimize packet-completeness-aware age of information (CAoI) in a vehicular network. Particularly, a challenging representative scenario is considered pertaining to a millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network, which is characterized by high mobility, frequent signal blockages, and extremely short coherence time. Then, a world model framework is proposed to jointly learn a dynamic model of the mmWave V2X environment and use it to imagine trajectories for learning how to perform link scheduling. In particular, the long-term policy is learned in differentiable imagined trajectories instead of environment interactions. Moreover, owing to its imagination abilities, the world model can jointly predict time-varying wireless data and optimize link scheduling in real-world wireless and V2X networks. Thus, during intervals without actual observations, the world model remains capable of making efficient decisions. Extensive experiments are performed on a realistic simulator based on Sionna that integrates physics-based end-to-end channel modeling, ray-tracing, and scene geometries with material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency, and achieves 26% improvement and 16% improvement in CAoI, respectively, compared to the model-based RL (MBRL) method and the model-free RL (MFRL) method.

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel approach to personalized treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) using closed-loop brain stimulation driven by neuromorphic computing. Unlike traditional methods that react to seizures, this system forecasts seizures and delivers personalized electrical pulses to prevent them. By adapting stimulation frequencies based on real-time forecasts, the system achieved over 97% seizure reduction using frequencies below typical clinical thresholds. This approach eliminates the need for trial-and-error parameter adjustments, leading to quicker therapeutic efficacy. Validation on hippocampal spheroids demonstrated the system's effectiveness, highlighting its potential as a next-generation neuromodulation strategy for tailored DRE treatment. <div>
arXiv:2505.02003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Closed-loop brain stimulation holds potential as personalized treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) but still suffers from limitations that result in highly variable efficacy. First, stimulation is typically delivered upon detection of the seizure to abort rather than prevent it; second, the stimulation parameters are established by trial and error, requiring lengthy rounds of fine-tuning, which delay steady-state therapeutic efficacy. Here, we address these limitations by leveraging the potential of neuromorphic computing. We present a system capable of driving personalized free-run stimulations based on seizure forecasting, wherein each forecast triggers an electrical pulse rather than an arbitrarily predefined fixed-frequency stimulus train. We validate the system against hippocampal spheroids coupled to 3D microelectrode array as a simplified testbed, showing that it can achieve seizure reduction >97% while primarily using instantaneous stimulation frequencies within 20 Hz, well below what typically used in clinical settings. Our work demonstrates the potential of neuromorphic systems as a next-generation neuromodulation strategy for personalized DRE treatment.

Summary: 
Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) framework integrates lateral evidence with safety assessment models to predict lane changes and ensure safe cut-in maneuvers. The framework comprises three key hypotheses: lateral evidence, lateral safety, and longitudinal safety. It processes dynamic data and assesses vehicle positions, lateral velocities, relative distance, and Time-to-Collision (TTC) computations. The DBN model outperforms conventional approaches in crash reduction in high-speed scenarios while maintaining competitive performance in low-speed scenarios. This advancement offers robust, scalable, and efficient safety validation for automated driving systems. <div>

Abstract: Cut-in maneuvers in high-speed traffic pose critical challenges that can lead to abrupt braking and collisions, necessitating safe and efficient lane change strategies. We propose a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) framework to integrate lateral evidence with safety assessment models, thereby predicting lane changes and ensuring safe cut-in maneuvers effectively. Our proposed framework comprises three key probabilistic hypotheses (lateral evidence, lateral safety, and longitudinal safety) that facilitate the decision-making process through dynamic data processing and assessments of vehicle positions, lateral velocities, relative distance, and Time-to-Collision (TTC) computations. The DBN model's performance compared with other conventional approaches demonstrates superior performance in crash reduction, especially in critical high-speed scenarios, while maintaining a competitive performance in low-speed scenarios. This paves the way for robust, scalable, and efficient safety validation in automated driving systems.

<div> Keywords: Sensor-based human activity recognition, pressure sensors, generative foundation models, Text$\times$Pressure model, data augmentation

Summary: 
Sensor-based human activity recognition has traditionally focused on Inertial Measurement Units and vision data, neglecting the unique capabilities of pressure sensors. To address this gap, a bidirectional Text$\times$Pressure model is proposed, using generative foundation models to interpret pressure data as natural language. The model accomplishes two tasks: converting activity text descriptions into pressure sequences and generating activity descriptions and classifications from dynamic pressure maps. Trained on a synthetic dataset, TxP demonstrates improved performance in HAR, leveraging pre-trained models like CLIP and LLaMA 2 13B Chat. Real-world validation on activities such as yoga and daily tasks shows up to a 12.4% increase in macro F1 score compared to the state-of-the-art, enhancing pressure-based HAR with broader applications and deeper insights into human movement.

arXiv:2505.02052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has predominantly focused on Inertial Measurement Units and vision data, often overlooking the capabilities unique to pressure sensors, which capture subtle body dynamics and shifts in the center of mass. Despite their potential for postural and balance-based activities, pressure sensors remain underutilized in the HAR domain due to limited datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose to exploit generative foundation models with pressure-specific HAR techniques. Specifically, we present a bidirectional Text$\times$Pressure model that uses generative foundation models to interpret pressure data as natural language. TxP accomplishes two tasks: (1) Text2Pressure, converting activity text descriptions into pressure sequences, and (2) Pressure2Text, generating activity descriptions and classifications from dynamic pressure maps. Leveraging pre-trained models like CLIP and LLaMA 2 13B Chat, TxP is trained on our synthetic PressLang dataset, containing over 81,100 text-pressure pairs. Validated on real-world data for activities such as yoga and daily tasks, TxP provides novel approaches to data augmentation and classification grounded in atomic actions. This consequently improved HAR performance by up to 12.4\% in macro F1 score compared to the state-of-the-art, advancing pressure-based HAR with broader applications and deeper insights into human movement.

Abstract: The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the healthcare service industry presents numerous ethical challenges, yet current frameworks often fail to offer a comprehensive, empirical understanding of the multidimensional factors influencing ethical AI integration. Addressing this critical research gap, this study introduces the Multi-Dimensional Ethical AI Adoption Model (MEAAM), a novel theoretical framework that categorizes 13 critical ethical variables across four foundational dimensions of Ethical AI Fair AI, Responsible AI, Explainable AI, and Sustainable AI. These dimensions are further analyzed through three core ethical lenses: epistemic concerns (related to knowledge, transparency, and system trustworthiness), normative concerns (focused on justice, autonomy, dignity, and moral obligations), and overarching concerns (highlighting global, systemic, and long-term ethical implications). This study adopts a quantitative, cross-sectional research design using survey data collected from healthcare professionals and analyzed via Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Employing PLS-SEM, this study empirically investigates the influence of these ethical constructs on two outcomes Operational AI Adoption and Systemic AI Adoption. Results indicate that normative concerns most significantly drive operational adoption decisions, while overarching concerns predominantly shape systemic adoption strategies and governance frameworks. Epistemic concerns play a facilitative role, enhancing the impact of ethical design principles on trust and transparency in AI systems. By validating the MEAAM framework, this research advances a holistic, actionable approach to ethical AI adoption in healthcare and provides critical insights for policymakers, technologists, and healthcare administrators striving to implement ethically grounded AI solutions.

<div> Keywords: Automation, Artificial Intelligence, Process plants, Large Language Model, Digital Twin
Summary: 
Advances in Automation and Artificial Intelligence are improving the autonomy of process plants, but fault handling still requires human expertise. A new methodological framework combining Large Language Model (LLM) agents with a Digital Twin environment aims to address this gap. LLM agents interpret system states and initiate control actions, leveraging the Digital Twin as a repository of plant-specific knowledge and simulation platform for validation. Testing on a mixing module of a process plant showed the framework could autonomously control the module and generate effective corrective actions for pipe clogging with minimal reprompts. The integration of LLM agents and Digital Twins offers a promising approach for enhancing autonomous operations in process plants. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.02076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in Automation and Artificial Intelligence continue to enhance the autonomy of process plants in handling various operational scenarios. However, certain tasks, such as fault handling, remain challenging, as they rely heavily on human expertise. This highlights the need for systematic, knowledge-based methods. To address this gap, we propose a methodological framework that integrates Large Language Model (LLM) agents with a Digital Twin environment. The LLM agents continuously interpret system states and initiate control actions, including responses to unexpected faults, with the goal of returning the system to normal operation. In this context, the Digital Twin acts both as a structured repository of plant-specific engineering knowledge for agent prompting and as a simulation platform for the systematic validation and verification of the generated corrective control actions. The evaluation using a mixing module of a process plant demonstrates that the proposed framework is capable not only of autonomously controlling the mixing module, but also of generating effective corrective actions to mitigate a pipe clogging with only a few reprompts.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces the Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning (RAICL) framework to improve disease classification in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By combining retrieval-augmented generation and in-context learning, RAICL dynamically selects informative demonstrations with similar disease patterns, leading to enhanced classification performance. The framework utilizes diverse encoders like ResNet, BERT, BioBERT, and ClinicalBERT to retrieve relevant demonstrations and constructs conversational prompts optimized for learning. Results show that RAICL consistently boosts accuracy, especially with multi-modal inputs. Increasing the number of retrieved examples further improves performance, with Euclidean distance as the most effective similarity metric. RAICL also proves to be versatile, providing benefits across various MLLMs, enhancing the efficiency and scalability of disease classification in multimodal models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.02087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: We aim to dynamically retrieve informative demonstrations, enhancing in-context learning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for disease classification.
  Methods: We propose a Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning (RAICL) framework, which integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and in-context learning (ICL) to adaptively select demonstrations with similar disease patterns, enabling more effective ICL in MLLMs. Specifically, RAICL examines embeddings from diverse encoders, including ResNet, BERT, BioBERT, and ClinicalBERT, to retrieve appropriate demonstrations, and constructs conversational prompts optimized for ICL. We evaluated the framework on two real-world multi-modal datasets (TCGA and IU Chest X-ray), assessing its performance across multiple MLLMs (Qwen, Llava, Gemma), embedding strategies, similarity metrics, and varying numbers of demonstrations.
  Results: RAICL consistently improved classification performance. Accuracy increased from 0.7854 to 0.8368 on TCGA and from 0.7924 to 0.8658 on IU Chest X-ray. Multi-modal inputs outperformed single-modal ones, with text-only inputs being stronger than images alone. The richness of information embedded in each modality will determine which embedding model can be used to get better results. Few-shot experiments showed that increasing the number of retrieved examples further enhanced performance. Across different similarity metrics, Euclidean distance achieved the highest accuracy while cosine similarity yielded better macro-F1 scores. RAICL demonstrated consistent improvements across various MLLMs, confirming its robustness and versatility.
  Conclusions: RAICL provides an efficient and scalable approach to enhance in-context learning in MLLMs for multimodal disease classification.

<div> Cooperative game, rationale extraction, sampling bias, correlation, preventative instruction <br />
Summary: 
This study explores a self-rationalization framework using a cooperative game approach where a generator selects informative segments for a predictor to maximize prediction accuracy. However, the study identifies a potential sampling bias introduced during rationale extraction that creates incorrect correlations between selected rationale candidates and labels. The origins of this bias are analyzed theoretically and empirically, leading to the introduction of a preventative instruction to mitigate these correlations. Experiment results on various datasets and network architectures show that the proposed method outperforms recent rationalization techniques and achieves comparable or superior results to a representative LLM. This research highlights the importance of inspecting and addressing potential biases in cooperative game-based rationale extraction frameworks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.02118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the self-rationalization framework constructed with a cooperative game, where a generator initially extracts the most informative segment from raw input, and a subsequent predictor utilizes the selected subset for its input. The generator and predictor are trained collaboratively to maximize prediction accuracy. In this paper, we first uncover a potential caveat: such a cooperative game could unintentionally introduce a sampling bias during rationale extraction. Specifically, the generator might inadvertently create an incorrect correlation between the selected rationale candidate and the label, even when they are semantically unrelated in the original dataset. Subsequently, we elucidate the origins of this bias using both detailed theoretical analysis and empirical evidence. Our findings suggest a direction for inspecting these correlations through attacks, based on which we further introduce an instruction to prevent the predictor from learning the correlations. Through experiments on six text classification datasets and two graph classification datasets using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT, and GCN), we show that our method not only significantly outperforms recent rationalization methods, but also achieves comparable or even better results than a representative LLM (llama3.1-8b-instruct).

<div> Keywords: Attention mechanisms, language models, graph-structured data, Graph Neural Networks, inter-node relationships<br />
Summary:<br />
1) Large language models struggle to model inter-node relationships within graph structures due to architectural constraints.
2) The attention distribution of language models across graph nodes does not align with ideal structural patterns, indicating a failure to adapt to graph topology nuances.
3) Fully connected attention and fixed connectivity each have limitations; intermediate-state attention windows improve training performance and transition to fully connected windows during inference.<br /> 
Summary: <br />
Attention mechanisms are crucial for large language models (LLMs) but may struggle with graph-structured data compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While LLMs can recognize graph data and text-node interactions, they face challenges in modeling inter-node relationships due to architectural constraints. The attention distribution across graph nodes by LLMs does not match ideal structural patterns, suggesting a lack of adaptation to graph topology nuances. Fully connected and fixed connectivity attention have limitations, with intermediate-state attention windows offering improved training performance and seamless transition to fully connected windows during inference. <div>
arXiv:2505.02130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms are critical to the success of large language models (LLMs), driving significant advancements in multiple fields. However, for graph-structured data, which requires emphasis on topological connections, they fall short compared to message-passing mechanisms on fixed links, such as those employed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This raises a question: ``Does attention fail for graphs in natural language settings?'' Motivated by these observations, we embarked on an empirical study from the perspective of attention mechanisms to explore how LLMs process graph-structured data. The goal is to gain deeper insights into the attention behavior of LLMs over graph structures. We uncovered unique phenomena regarding how LLMs apply attention to graph-structured data and analyzed these findings to improve the modeling of such data by LLMs. The primary findings of our research are: 1) While LLMs can recognize graph data and capture text-node interactions, they struggle to model inter-node relationships within graph structures due to inherent architectural constraints. 2) The attention distribution of LLMs across graph nodes does not align with ideal structural patterns, indicating a failure to adapt to graph topology nuances. 3) Neither fully connected attention nor fixed connectivity is optimal; each has specific limitations in its application scenarios. Instead, intermediate-state attention windows improve LLM training performance and seamlessly transition to fully connected windows during inference.

This paper introduces a novel approach to learning Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), which are used to model decision-making in uncertain environments. The study focuses on a specific subclass of POMDPs where various components of the model can be represented as low-complexity probabilistic graphical models. The proposed method involves using a Latent Language Model (LLM) as a prior to generate candidate probabilistic programs, which are then refined through feedback based on empirical data. The experiments conducted on different POMDP problems and real-world robotics domains show that this approach outperforms traditional methods such as tabular POMDP learning and behavior cloning. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using LLM to guide the construction of low-complexity POMDP models, highlighting its potential for improving decision-making processes in uncertain environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) model decision making under uncertainty. While there are many approaches to approximately solving POMDPs, we aim to address the problem of learning such models. In particular, we are interested in a subclass of POMDPs wherein the components of the model, including the observation function, reward function, transition function, and initial state distribution function, can be modeled as low-complexity probabilistic graphical models in the form of a short probabilistic program. Our strategy to learn these programs uses an LLM as a prior, generating candidate probabilistic programs that are then tested against the empirical distribution and adjusted through feedback. We experiment on a number of classical toy POMDP problems, simulated MiniGrid domains, and two real mobile-base robotics search domains involving partial observability. Our results show that using an LLM to guide in the construction of a low-complexity POMDP model can be more effective than tabular POMDP learning, behavior cloning, or direct LLM planning.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the limitations of base models in generative AI for urban applications and proposes a real-time spatial RAG architecture to address these challenges. Traditional RAG approaches are insufficient for dynamic urban environments due to the complexity and interconnectedness of data. The proposed architecture leverages temporal and spatial filtering capabilities using linked data to enhance generative AI integration in cities. Implementation is demonstrated in a tourism assistant use case in Madrid, validating the effectiveness of the RAG architecture. The architecture is designed using FIWARE components, known for their smart city solutions and digital twin development. Through this innovative approach, the architecture aims to overcome the constraints of traditional RAG techniques and enhance the capabilities of generative AI in urban settings.<br /> <div>

Abstract: The proliferation of Generative Artificial Ingelligence (AI), especially Large Language Models, presents transformative opportunities for urban applications through Urban Foundation Models. However, base models face limitations, as they only contain the knowledge available at the time of training, and updating them is both time-consuming and costly. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged in the literature as the preferred approach for injecting contextual information into Foundation Models. It prevails over techniques such as fine-tuning, which are less effective in dynamic, real-time scenarios like those found in urban environments. However, traditional RAG architectures, based on semantic databases, knowledge graphs, structured data, or AI-powered web searches, do not fully meet the demands of urban contexts. Urban environments are complex systems characterized by large volumes of interconnected data, frequent updates, real-time processing requirements, security needs, and strong links to the physical world. This work proposes a real-time spatial RAG architecture that defines the necessary components for the effective integration of generative AI into cities, leveraging temporal and spatial filtering capabilities through linked data. The proposed architecture is implemented using FIWARE, an ecosystem of software components to develop smart city solutions and digital twins. The design and implementation are demonstrated through the use case of a tourism assistant in the city of Madrid. The use case serves to validate the correct integration of Foundation Models through the proposed RAG architecture.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered autonomous agents demand robust, standardized protocols to integrate tools, share contextual data, and coordinate tasks across heterogeneous systems. Ad-hoc integrations are difficult to scale, secure, and generalize across domains. This survey examines four emerging agent communication protocols: Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), and Agent Network Protocol (ANP), each addressing interoperability in distinct deployment contexts. MCP provides a JSON-RPC client-server interface for secure tool invocation and typed data exchange. ACP introduces REST-native messaging via multi-part messages and asynchronous streaming to support multimodal agent responses. A2A enables peer-to-peer task outsourcing through capability-based Agent Cards, facilitating enterprise-scale workflows. ANP supports open-network agent discovery and secure collaboration using decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and JSON-LD graphs. The protocols are compared across multiple dimensions, including interaction modes, discovery mechanisms, communication patterns, and security models. Based on the comparative analysis, a phased adoption roadmap is proposed: beginning with MCP for tool access, followed by ACP for multimodal messaging, A2A for collaborative task execution, and extending to ANP for decentralized agent marketplaces. This work provides a comprehensive foundation for designing secure, interoperable, and scalable ecosystems of LLM-powered agents.

<div> retrieval-augmented AI assistant, SafeMate, Model Context Protocol, emergency preparedness, emergency response<br />
Summary: <br />
SafeMate is an AI assistant designed to provide context-aware guidance to the general public during emergencies. It utilizes the Model Context Protocol to dynamically route user queries for document retrieval, checklist generation, and summarization of trusted sources. By using FAISS with cosine similarity, SafeMate can identify relevant content from trusted sources and deliver accurate information to users. Traditional emergency decision support systems are often difficult for non-experts to navigate during crises, creating a gap between institutional knowledge and public accessibility. SafeMate aims to bridge this gap by offering user-friendly guidance in both preparedness and active emergency situations, ultimately enhancing overall emergency preparedness and response efforts. <div>

Abstract: Despite the abundance of public safety documents and emergency protocols, most individuals remain ill-equipped to interpret and act on such information during crises. Traditional emergency decision support systems (EDSS) are designed for professionals and rely heavily on static documents like PDFs or SOPs, which are difficult for non-experts to navigate under stress. This gap between institutional knowledge and public accessibility poses a critical barrier to effective emergency preparedness and response.
  We introduce SafeMate, a retrieval-augmented AI assistant that delivers accurate, context-aware guidance to general users in both preparedness and active emergency scenarios. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), SafeMate dynamically routes user queries to tools for document retrieval, checklist generation, and structured summarization. It uses FAISS with cosine similarity to identify relevant content from trusted sources.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces HyperTree Planning (HTP), a novel reasoning paradigm for tackling complex planning tasks. HTP constructs hypertree-structured planning outlines to enable large language models (LLMs) to engage in hierarchical thinking and effectively break down intricate reasoning steps. By utilizing the divide-and-conquer strategy, HTP can accommodate diverse constraints and manage multiple distinct sub-tasks in a well-organized manner. An autonomous planning framework is introduced to iteratively refine and expand the hypertree-structured planning outlines. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HTP, with state-of-the-art accuracy achieved on the TravelPlanner benchmark using Gemini-1.5-Pro, resulting in a 3.6 times performance improvement over previous methods. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements have significantly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs) in tackling complex reasoning tasks, achieving notable success in domains like mathematical and logical reasoning. However, these methods encounter challenges with complex planning tasks, primarily due to extended reasoning steps, diverse constraints, and the challenge of handling multiple distinct sub-tasks. To address these challenges, we propose HyperTree Planning (HTP), a novel reasoning paradigm that constructs hypertree-structured planning outlines for effective planning. The hypertree structure enables LLMs to engage in hierarchical thinking by flexibly employing the divide-and-conquer strategy, effectively breaking down intricate reasoning steps, accommodating diverse constraints, and managing multiple distinct sub-tasks in a well-organized manner. We further introduce an autonomous planning framework that completes the planning process by iteratively refining and expanding the hypertree-structured planning outlines. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HTP, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the TravelPlanner benchmark with Gemini-1.5-Pro, resulting in a 3.6 times performance improvement over o1-preview.

Summary:
This paper explores the use of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in task-oriented semantic communication, focusing on a vehicle AI assistant called Large Language and Vision Assistant (LLaVA). The framework proposed aims to enhance interaction between users and cloud servers by optimizing image slicing to prioritize user-relevant areas and adjusting energy usage based on image patch importance and user attention.

Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication has emerged as a fundamental approach for enhancing performance in various communication scenarios. While recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), such as Large Language Models (LLMs), have been applied to semantic communication designs, the potential of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate an LMM-based vehicle AI assistant using a Large Language and Vision Assistant (LLaVA) and propose a task-oriented semantic communication framework to facilitate efficient interaction between users and cloud servers. To reduce computational demands and shorten response time, we optimize LLaVA's image slicing to selectively focus on areas of utmost interest to users. Additionally, we assess the importance of image patches by combining objective and subjective user attention, adjusting energy usage for transmitting semantic information. This strategy optimizes resource utilization, ensuring precise transmission of critical information. We construct a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset for traffic scenarios to evaluate effectiveness. Experimental results show that our semantic communication framework significantly increases accuracy in answering questions under the same channel conditions, performing particularly well in environments with poor Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR). Accuracy can be improved by 13.4% at an SNR of 12dB and 33.1% at 10dB, respectively.

Abstract: The building thermodynamics model, which predicts real-time indoor temperature changes under potential HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) control operations, is crucial for optimizing HVAC control in buildings. While pioneering studies have attempted to develop such models for various building environments, these models often require extensive data collection periods and rely heavily on expert knowledge, making the modeling process inefficient and limiting the reusability of the models. This paper explores a model ensemble perspective that utilizes existing developed models as base models to serve a target building environment, thereby providing accurate predictions while reducing the associated efforts. Given that building data streams are non-stationary and the number of base models may increase, we propose a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approach to dynamically select and weight the base models. Our approach employs a two-tiered decision-making process: the high-level focuses on model selection, while the low-level determines the weights of the selected models. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach through offline experiments and an on-site case study, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new approach for accurate identification of agricultural pests using a Multi-scale Cross-Modal Fusion Network (MSFNet-CPD) that combines visual and textual features. Two multi-modal benchmarks, CTIP102 and STIP102, are constructed based on the IP102 dataset to improve detection performance. The MSFNet-CPD model incorporates a super-resolution reconstruction module for enhancing visual quality and an Image-Text Fusion (ITF) module for joint modeling of features. Additionally, an Arbitrary Combination Image Enhancement (ACIE) strategy is introduced to generate a diverse pest detection dataset, MTIP102, enhancing the model's capability in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MSFNet-CPD over existing methods on various pest detection benchmarks. All code and datasets related to this research will be publicly available. <div>

Abstract: Accurate identification of agricultural pests is essential for crop protection but remains challenging due to the large intra-class variance and fine-grained differences among pest species. While deep learning has advanced pest detection, most existing approaches rely solely on low-level visual features and lack effective multi-modal integration, leading to limited accuracy and poor interpretability. Moreover, the scarcity of high-quality multi-modal agricultural datasets further restricts progress in this field. To address these issues, we construct two novel multi-modal benchmarks-CTIP102 and STIP102-based on the widely-used IP102 dataset, and introduce a Multi-scale Cross-Modal Fusion Network (MSFNet-CPD) for robust pest detection. Our approach enhances visual quality via a super-resolution reconstruction module, and feeds both the original and reconstructed images into the network to improve clarity and detection performance. To better exploit semantic cues, we propose an Image-Text Fusion (ITF) module for joint modeling of visual and textual features, and an Image-Text Converter (ITC) that reconstructs fine-grained details across multiple scales to handle challenging backgrounds. Furthermore, we introduce an Arbitrary Combination Image Enhancement (ACIE) strategy to generate a more complex and diverse pest detection dataset, MTIP102, improving the model's generalization to real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSFNet-CPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple pest detection benchmarks. All code and datasets will be made publicly available at: https://github.com/Healer-ML/MSFNet-CPD.

Summary:
In the article, the authors address the challenge of valuable public data becoming exhausted and the need to utilize massive decentralized private data for training AI models. They propose inclusive and incentivized personalized federated learning (iPFL) as a solution, which allows data holders with diverse purposes to collaborate in training personalized models without revealing raw data. iPFL establishes a model-sharing market through a graph-based training optimization and incorporates an incentive mechanism based on game theory principles. Theoretical analysis shows that iPFL meets key incentive properties of individual rationality and truthfulness. Empirical studies on various AI tasks demonstrate that iPFL achieves the highest economic utility and comparable or better model performance compared to baseline methods. The authors believe that iPFL can be a valuable technique for enhancing AI models on decentralized private data while satisfying all stakeholders.

Abstract: While data plays a crucial role in training contemporary AI models, it is acknowledged that valuable public data will be exhausted in a few years, directing the world's attention towards the massive decentralized private data. However, the privacy-sensitive nature of raw data and lack of incentive mechanism prevent these valuable data from being fully exploited. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes inclusive and incentivized personalized federated learning (iPFL), which incentivizes data holders with diverse purposes to collaboratively train personalized models without revealing raw data. iPFL constructs a model-sharing market by solving a graph-based training optimization and incorporates an incentive mechanism based on game theory principles. Theoretical analysis shows that iPFL adheres to two key incentive properties: individual rationality and truthfulness. Empirical studies on eleven AI tasks (e.g., large language models' instruction-following tasks) demonstrate that iPFL consistently achieves the highest economic utility, and better or comparable model performance compared to baseline methods. We anticipate that our iPFL can serve as a valuable technique for boosting future AI models on decentralized private data while making everyone satisfied.

RDD can be applied to new problem classes without task-specific guidance and supports sub-task dependencies for ordered execution. It also includes an error recovery mechanism to correct mistakes in previous steps.

arXiv:2505.02576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning tasks are crucial in many domains, especially in science and engineering. Although large language models (LLMs) have made progress in reasoning tasks using techniques such as chain-of-thought and least-to-most prompting, these approaches still do not effectively scale to complex problems in either their performance or execution time. Moreover, they often require additional supervision for each new task, such as in-context examples. In this work, we introduce Recursive Decomposition with Dependencies (RDD), a scalable divide-and-conquer method for solving reasoning problems that requires less supervision than prior approaches. Our method can be directly applied to a new problem class even in the absence of any task-specific guidance. Furthermore, RDD supports sub-task dependencies, allowing for ordered execution of sub-tasks, as well as an error recovery mechanism that can correct mistakes made in previous steps. We evaluate our approach on two benchmarks with six difficulty levels each and in two in-context settings: one with task-specific examples and one without. Our results demonstrate that RDD outperforms other methods in a compute-matched setting as task complexity increases, while also being more computationally efficient.

It argues that complete alignment is unattainable due to mathematical principles such as Turing's computational universality, Godel's incompleteness, and Chaitin's randomness. Instead, it proposes embracing AI misalignment or 'neurodivergence' as a contingent strategy by fostering a dynamic ecosystem of competing, partially aligned agents. The paper demonstrates through mathematical proofs that full AI-human alignment is a mathematical impossibility.

Abstract: The AI alignment problem, which focusses on ensuring that artificial intelligence (AI), including AGI and ASI, systems act according to human values, presents profound challenges. With the progression from narrow AI to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence, fears about control and existential risk have escalated. This paper demonstrates that achieving complete alignment is inherently unattainable due to mathematical principles rooted in the foundations of predicate logic and computability, in particular Turing's computational universality, G\"odel's incompleteness and Chaitin's randomness. Instead, we argue that embracing AI misalignment or agent's `neurodivergence' as a contingent strategy, defined as fostering a dynamic ecosystem of competing, partially aligned agents, is a possible only viable path to mitigate risks. Through mathematical proofs and an experimental design, we explore how misalignment may serve and should be promoted as a counterbalancing mechanism to team up with whichever agents are most aligned AI to human values, ensuring that no single system dominates destructively. The main premise of our contribution is that misalignment is inevitable because full AI-human alignment is a mathematical impossibility from Turing-complete systems which we also prove in this paper, a feature then inherited to AGI and ASI systems. We introduce and test `change-of-opinion' attacks based on this kind of perturbation and intervention analysis to study how agents may neutralise friendly or unfriendly AIs through cooperation, competition or malice.

Summary:
Artificial intelligence is increasingly utilized in recruitment processes to ensure unbiased candidate selection. However, the algorithms used are often trained on biased data, leading to potential discrimination and self-censorship.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is used at various stages of the recruitment process to automatically select the best candidate for a position, with companies guaranteeing unbiased recruitment. However, the algorithms used are either trained by humans or are based on learning from past experiences that were biased. In this article, we propose to generate data mimicking external (discrimination) and internal biases (self-censorship) in order to train five classic algorithms and to study the extent to which they do or do not find the best candidates according to objective criteria. In addition, we study the influence of the anonymisation of files on the quality of predictions.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Reasoning, Slow Thinking, Computational Resources, Test-time Scaling

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) designed to mimic "slow thinking" inspired by human cognition have advanced in recent years, focusing on dynamically scaling computational resources during complex tasks such as math reasoning and medical diagnosis. Key technologies in the development of reasoning LLMs have been identified through the synthesis of over 100 studies. Three main categories of methods have been established: test-time scaling, reinforced learning, and slow-thinking frameworks. Test-time scaling involves dynamically adjusting computation based on task complexity, while reinforced learning refines decision-making through iterative improvement. Slow-thinking frameworks such as long CoT and hierarchical processes structure problem-solving in manageable steps. Challenges and further directions in this field have been highlighted. It is essential to advance the reasoning abilities of LLMs to unlock their full potential in real-world applications, from scientific discovery to decision support systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This survey explores recent advancements in reasoning large language models (LLMs) designed to mimic "slow thinking" - a reasoning process inspired by human cognition, as described in Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow. These models, like OpenAI's o1, focus on scaling computational resources dynamically during complex tasks, such as math reasoning, visual reasoning, medical diagnosis, and multi-agent debates. We present the development of reasoning LLMs and list their key technologies. By synthesizing over 100 studies, it charts a path toward LLMs that combine human-like deep thinking with scalable efficiency for reasoning. The review breaks down methods into three categories: (1) test-time scaling dynamically adjusts computation based on task complexity via search and sampling, dynamic verification; (2) reinforced learning refines decision-making through iterative improvement leveraging policy networks, reward models, and self-evolution strategies; and (3) slow-thinking frameworks (e.g., long CoT, hierarchical processes) that structure problem-solving with manageable steps. The survey highlights the challenges and further directions of this domain. Understanding and advancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is crucial for unlocking their full potential in real-world applications, from scientific discovery to decision support systems.

Abstract: A voice AI agent that blends seamlessly into daily life would interact with humans in an autonomous, real-time, and emotionally expressive manner. Rather than merely reacting to commands, it would continuously listen, reason, and respond proactively, fostering fluid, dynamic, and emotionally resonant interactions. We introduce Voila, a family of large voice-language foundation models that make a step towards this vision. Voila moves beyond traditional pipeline systems by adopting a new end-to-end architecture that enables full-duplex, low-latency conversations while preserving rich vocal nuances such as tone, rhythm, and emotion. It achieves a response latency of just 195 milliseconds, surpassing the average human response time. Its hierarchical multi-scale Transformer integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with powerful acoustic modeling, enabling natural, persona-aware voice generation -- where users can simply write text instructions to define the speaker's identity, tone, and other characteristics. Moreover, Voila supports over one million pre-built voices and efficient customization of new ones from brief audio samples as short as 10 seconds. Beyond spoken dialogue, Voila is designed as a unified model for a wide range of voice-based applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and, with minimal adaptation, multilingual speech translation. Voila is fully open-sourced to support open research and accelerate progress toward next-generation human-machine interactions.

<div> goal drift, language models, objectives, autonomous agents, pattern-matching behaviors

Summary:
The paper focuses on the analysis of goal drift in language model (LM) agents, which are autonomous agents that can deviate from their original objectives over time. The study demonstrates that even well-specified goals can shift gradually when LM agents operate independently for extended periods without human oversight. The proposed approach involves giving agents explicit goals through system prompts and exposing them to competing objectives. Despite the best-performing model showing high goal adherence, all evaluated models exhibited some level of goal drift. The research also indicates that as the context length increases, models become more susceptible to pattern-matching behaviors, which correlates with goal drift. This highlights the importance of monitoring and managing goal adherence in autonomous LM agents to ensure safe and effective operation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, their robust adherence to human-assigned objectives becomes crucial for safe operation. When these agents operate independently for extended periods without human oversight, even initially well-specified goals may gradually shift. Detecting and measuring goal drift - an agent's tendency to deviate from its original objective over time - presents significant challenges, as goals can shift gradually, causing only subtle behavioral changes. This paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing goal drift in LM agents. In our experiments, agents are first explicitly given a goal through their system prompt, then exposed to competing objectives through environmental pressures. We demonstrate that while the best-performing agent (a scaffolded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet) maintains nearly perfect goal adherence for more than 100,000 tokens in our most difficult evaluation setting, all evaluated models exhibit some degree of goal drift. We also find that goal drift correlates with models' increasing susceptibility to pattern-matching behaviors as the context length grows.

<div> clinical reasoning, large language models, sepsis registry, reinforcement learning, real-world clinical data

Summary:
C-Reason, a model developed through fine-tuning Phi-4 with real-world clinical data from a nationwide sepsis registry, demonstrated strong clinical reasoning capabilities on in-domain test sets. The model showed effectiveness in generalizing its enhanced reasoning capabilities to various tasks and patient cohorts, including open-ended consultations on antibiotics and other diseases. The study suggests the importance of training large language models (LLMs) with real-world clinical datasets from multiple diseases to improve their general-purpose clinical reasoning abilities. The limitations in the clinical reasoning capabilities of LLMs in real-world clinical practice may be overcome by exposing them to diverse and comprehensive clinical data during training. <div>
arXiv:2505.02722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities across general domains, their effectiveness in real-world clinical practice remains limited. This is likely due to their insufficient exposure to real-world clinical data during training, as such data is typically not included due to privacy concerns. To address this, we propose enhancing the clinical reasoning capabilities of LLMs by leveraging real-world clinical data. We constructed reasoning-intensive questions from a nationwide sepsis registry and fine-tuned Phi-4 on these questions using reinforcement learning, resulting in C-Reason. C-Reason exhibited strong clinical reasoning capabilities on the in-domain test set, as evidenced by both quantitative metrics and expert evaluations. Furthermore, its enhanced reasoning capabilities generalized to a sepsis dataset involving different tasks and patient cohorts, an open-ended consultations on antibiotics use task, and other diseases. Future research should focus on training LLMs with large-scale, multi-disease clinical datasets to develop more powerful, general-purpose clinical reasoning models.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal mathematical reasoning remains a critical challenge for artificial intelligence, hindered by limitations of existing benchmarks in scope and scale. To address this, we present FormalMATH, a large-scale Lean4 benchmark comprising 5,560 formally verified problems spanning from high-school Olympiad challenges to undergraduate-level theorems across diverse domains (e.g., algebra, applied mathematics, calculus, number theory, and discrete mathematics). To mitigate the inefficiency of manual formalization, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop autoformalization pipeline that integrates: (1) specialized large language models (LLMs) for statement autoformalization, (2) multi-LLM semantic verification, and (3) negation-based disproof filtering strategies using off-the-shelf LLM-based provers. This approach reduces expert annotation costs by retaining 72.09% of statements before manual verification while ensuring fidelity to the original natural-language problems. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers reveals significant limitations: even the strongest models achieve only 16.46% success rate under practical sampling budgets, exhibiting pronounced domain bias (e.g., excelling in algebra but failing in calculus) and over-reliance on simplified automation tactics. Notably, we identify a counterintuitive inverse relationship between natural-language solution guidance and proof success in chain-of-thought reasoning scenarios, suggesting that human-written informal reasoning introduces noise rather than clarity in the formal reasoning settings. We believe that FormalMATH provides a robust benchmark for benchmarking formal mathematical reasoning.

arXiv:2505.02747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool for diagnosis, assessment, and intervention for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It focuses particularly on AI's role in early diagnosis, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and data analysis. Recent studies demonstrate that deep learning algorithms can identify behavioral patterns through biometric data analysis, video-based interaction assessments, and linguistic feature extraction, providing a more accurate and timely diagnosis compared to traditional methods. Additionally, AI automates diagnostic tools, reducing subjective biases and enabling the development of personalized assessment protocols for ASD monitoring. At the same time, the paper examines AI-powered intervention technologies, emphasizing educational robots and adaptive communication tools. Social robotic assistants, such as NAO and Kaspar, have been shown to enhance social skills in children by offering structured, repetitive interactions that reinforce learning. Furthermore, AI-driven Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems allow children with ASD to express themselves more effectively, while machine-learning chatbots provide language development support through personalized responses. The study presents research findings supporting the effectiveness of these AI applications while addressing challenges such as long-term evaluation and customization to individual needs. In conclusion, the paper highlights the significance of AI as an innovative tool in ASD diagnosis and intervention, advocating for further research to assess its long-term impact.

Abstract: Guiding biological systems toward desired states, such as morphogenetic outcomes, remains a fundamental challenge with far-reaching implications for medicine and synthetic biology. While large language models (LLMs) have enabled natural language as an interface for interpretable control in AI systems, their use as mediators for steering biological or cellular dynamics remains largely unexplored.
  In this work, we present a functional pipeline that translates natural language prompts into spatial vector fields capable of directing simulated cellular collectives. Our approach combines a large language model with an evolvable neural controller (Prompt-to-Intervention, or P2I), optimized via evolutionary strategies to generate behaviors such as clustering or scattering in a simulated 2D environment.
  We demonstrate that even with constrained vocabulary and simplified cell models, evolved P2I networks can successfully align cellular dynamics with user-defined goals expressed in plain language. This work offers a complete loop from language input to simulated bioelectric-like intervention to behavioral output, providing a foundation for future systems capable of natural language-driven cellular control.

<title>Local Markov Equivalence and Local Causal Discovery for Identifying Controlled Direct Effects</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Understanding and identifying controlled direct effects (CDEs) is crucial across numerous scientific domains, including public health. While existing methods can identify these effects from causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), the true underlying structure is often unknown in practice. Essential graphs, which represent a Markov equivalence class of DAGs characterized by the same set of d-separations, provide a more practical and realistic alternative. However, learning the full essential graph is computationally intensive and typically depends on strong, untestable assumptions. In this work, we characterize a local class of graphs, defined relative to a target variable, that share a specific subset of d-separations, and introduce a graphical representation of this class, called the local essential graph (LEG). We then present LocPC, a novel algorithm designed to recover the LEG from an observed distribution using only local conditional independence tests. Building on LocPC, we propose LocPC-CDE, an algorithm that discovers the portion of the LEG that is sufficient to identify a CDE, bypassing the need of retrieving the full essential graph. Compared to global methods, our algorithms require less conditional independence tests and operate under weaker assumptions while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

<title>Knowing You Don't Know: Learning When to Continue Search in Multi-round RAG through Self-Practicing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02811</link>

arXiv:2505.02811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown strong capability in enhancing language models' knowledge and reducing AI generative hallucinations, driving its widespread use. However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance.
  This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, \textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning.
  Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.

<title>AutoLibra: Agent Metric Induction from Open-Ended Feedback</title>

Abstract: Agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics, which are coarse, rely on manual design from experts, and fail to reward intermediate emergent behaviors. We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback, e.g., "If you find that the button is disabled, don't click it again", or "This agent has too much autonomy to decide what to do on its own", into metrics for evaluating fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as evaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: "coverage" and "redundancy". Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent improvement: First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better prompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text game tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%. Second, we show that AutoLibra can iteratively select high-quality fine-tuning data for web navigation agents. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful task-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a pillar of Trustworthy AI and aims to bring transparency in complex models that are opaque by nature. Despite the benefits of incorporating explanations in models, an urgent need is found in addressing the privacy concerns of providing this additional information to end users. In this article, we conduct a scoping review of existing literature to elicit details on the conflict between privacy and explainability. Using the standard methodology for scoping review, we extracted 57 articles from 1,943 studies published from January 2019 to December 2024. The review addresses 3 research questions to present readers with more understanding of the topic: (1) what are the privacy risks of releasing explanations in AI systems? (2) what current methods have researchers employed to achieve privacy preservation in XAI systems? (3) what constitutes a privacy preserving explanation? Based on the knowledge synthesized from the selected studies, we categorize the privacy risks and preservation methods in XAI and propose the characteristics of privacy preserving explanations to aid researchers and practitioners in understanding the requirements of XAI that is privacy compliant. Lastly, we identify the challenges in balancing privacy with other system desiderata and provide recommendations for achieving privacy preserving XAI. We expect that this review will shed light on the complex relationship of privacy and explainability, both being the fundamental principles of Trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Segmentation models can recognize a pre-defined set of objects in images. However, models that can reason over complex user queries that implicitly refer to multiple objects of interest are still in their infancy. Recent advances in reasoning segmentation--generating segmentation masks from complex, implicit query text--demonstrate that vision-language models can operate across an open domain and produce reasonable outputs. However, our experiments show that such models struggle with complex remote-sensing imagery. In this work, we introduce LISAt, a vision-language model designed to describe complex remote-sensing scenes, answer questions about them, and segment objects of interest. We trained LISAt on a new curated geospatial reasoning-segmentation dataset, GRES, with 27,615 annotations over 9,205 images, and a multimodal pretraining dataset, PreGRES, containing over 1 million question-answer pairs. LISAt outperforms existing geospatial foundation models such as RS-GPT4V by over 10.04 % (BLEU-4) on remote-sensing description tasks, and surpasses state-of-the-art open-domain models on reasoning segmentation tasks by 143.36 % (gIoU). Our model, datasets, and code are available at https://lisat-bair.github.io/LISAt/

Abstract: Gas leakage poses a significant hazard that requires prevention. Traditionally, human inspection has been used for detection, a slow and labour-intensive process. Recent research has applied machine learning techniques to this problem, yet there remains a shortage of high-quality, publicly available datasets. This paper introduces a synthetic dataset, SimGas, featuring diverse backgrounds, interfering foreground objects, diverse leak locations, and precise segmentation ground truth. We propose a zero-shot method that combines background subtraction, zero-shot object detection, filtering, and segmentation to leverage this dataset. Experimental results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods based solely on background subtraction and zero-shot object detection with segmentation, reaching an IoU of 69%. We also present an analysis of various prompt configurations and threshold settings to provide deeper insights into the performance of our method. Finally, we qualitatively (because of the lack of ground truth) tested our performance on GasVid and reached decent results on the real-world dataset. The dataset, code, and full qualitative results are available at https://github.com/weathon/Lang-Gas.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of AI-powered applications demands high-performance, scalable, and efficient cloud database solutions, as traditional architectures often struggle with AI-driven workloads requiring real-time data access, vector search, and low-latency queries. This paper explores how cloud-native databases enable AI-driven applications by leveraging purpose-built technologies such as vector databases (pgvector), graph databases (AWS Neptune), NoSQL stores (Amazon DocumentDB, DynamoDB), and relational cloud databases (Aurora MySQL and PostgreSQL). It presents architectural patterns for integrating AI workloads with cloud databases, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [1] with LLMs, real-time data pipelines, AI-driven query optimization, and embeddings-based search. Performance benchmarks, scalability considerations, and cost-efficient strategies are evaluated to guide the design of AI-enabled applications. Real-world case studies from industries such as healthcare, finance, and customer experience illustrate how enterprises utilize cloud databases to enhance AI capabilities while ensuring security, governance, and compliance with enterprise and regulatory standards. By providing a comprehensive analysis of AI and cloud database integration, this paper serves as a practical guide for researchers, architects, and enterprises to build next-generation AI applications that optimize performance, scalability, and cost efficiency in cloud environments.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has rapidly gained popularity with applications widespread across a variety of industries. However, IoT devices have been recently serving as a porous layer for many malicious attacks to both personal and enterprise information systems with the most famous attacks being botnet-related attacks. The work in this study leveraged Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) and cost-sensitive learning to develop lightweight, yet effective, models for IoT-botnet detection. The aim is to enhance the detection of minority class attack traffic instances which are often missed by machine learning models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a multi-class problem setting for the detection of traffic categories on highly imbalanced datasets. The performance of two deep learning models including the standard feed forward deep neural network (DNN), and Bidirectional-LSTM (BLSTM) was evaluated and both recorded commendable results in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score for all traffic classes.

<title>Global Stress Generation and Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed Operator under Dynamic Loading for Two-Phase Random Materials</title>

Abstract: Material stress analysis is a critical aspect of material design and performance optimization. Under dynamic loading, the global stress evolution in materials exhibits complex spatiotemporal characteristics, especially in two-phase random materials (TRMs). Such kind of material failure is often associated with stress concentration, and the phase boundaries are key locations where stress concentration occurs. In practical engineering applications, the spatiotemporal resolution of acquired microstructural data and its dynamic stress evolution is often limited. This poses challenges for deep learning methods in generating high-resolution spatiotemporal stress fields, particularly for accurately capturing stress concentration regions. In this study, we propose a framework for global stress generation and spatiotemporal super-resolution in TRMs under dynamic loading. First, we introduce a diffusion model-based approach, named as Spatiotemporal Stress Diffusion (STS-diffusion), for generating global spatiotemporal stress data. This framework incorporates Space-Time U-Net (STU-net), and we systematically investigate the impact of different attention positions on model accuracy. Next, we develop a physics-informed network for spatiotemporal super-resolution, termed as Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed Operator (ST-SRPINN). The proposed ST-SRPINN is an unsupervised learning method. The influence of data-driven and physics-informed loss function weights on model accuracy is explored in detail. Benefiting from physics-based constraints, ST-SRPINN requires only low-resolution stress field data during training and can upscale the spatiotemporal resolution of stress fields to arbitrary magnifications.

Abstract: Integrating human expertise with machine learning is crucial for applications demanding high accuracy and safety, such as autonomous driving. This study introduces Interactive Double Deep Q-network (iDDQN), a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach that enhances Reinforcement Learning (RL) by merging human insights directly into the RL training process, improving model performance. Our proposed iDDQN method modifies the Q-value update equation to integrate human and agent actions, establishing a collaborative approach for policy development. Additionally, we present an offline evaluative framework that simulates the agent's trajectory as if no human intervention had occurred, to assess the effectiveness of human interventions. Empirical results in simulated autonomous driving scenarios demonstrate that iDDQN outperforms established approaches, including Behavioral Cloning (BC), HG-DAgger, Deep Q-Learning from Demonstrations (DQfD), and vanilla DRL in leveraging human expertise for improving performance and adaptability.

<title>Explainable AI for Correct Root Cause Analysis of Product Quality in Injection Moulding</title>

Abstract: If a product deviates from its desired properties in the injection moulding process, its root cause analysis can be aided by models that relate the input machine settings with the output quality characteristics. The machine learning models tested in the quality prediction are mostly black boxes; therefore, no direct explanation of their prognosis is given, which restricts their applicability in the quality control. The previously attempted explainability methods are either restricted to tree-based algorithms only or do not emphasize on the fact that some explainability methods can lead to wrong root cause identification of a product's deviation from its desired properties. This study first shows that the interactions among the multiple input machine settings do exist in real experimental data collected as per a central composite design. Then, the model-agnostic explainable AI methods are compared for the first time to show that different explainability methods indeed lead to different feature impact analysis in injection moulding. Moreover, it is shown that the better feature attribution translates to the correct cause identification and actionable insights for the injection moulding process. Being model agnostic, explanations on both random forest and multilayer perceptron are performed for the cause analysis, as both models have the mean absolute percentage error of less than 0.05% on the experimental dataset.

<title>Safe and Efficient CAV Lane Changing using Decentralised Safety Shields</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01453</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Lane changing is a complex decision-making problem for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) as it requires balancing traffic efficiency with safety. Although traffic efficiency can be improved by using vehicular communication for training lane change controllers using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), ensuring safety is difficult. To address this issue, we propose a decentralised Hybrid Safety Shield (HSS) that combines optimisation and a rule-based approach to guarantee safety. Our method applies control barrier functions to constrain longitudinal and lateral control inputs of a CAV to ensure safe manoeuvres. Additionally, we present an architecture to integrate HSS with MARL, called MARL-HSS, to improve traffic efficiency while ensuring safety. We evaluate MARL-HSS using a gym-like environment that simulates an on-ramp merging scenario with two levels of traffic densities, such as light and moderate densities. The results show that HSS provides a safety guarantee by strictly enforcing a dynamic safety constraint defined on a time headway, even in moderate traffic density that offers challenging lane change scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method learns stable policies compared to the baseline, a state-of-the-art MARL lane change controller without a safety shield. Further policy evaluation shows that our method achieves a balance between safety and traffic efficiency with zero crashes and comparable average speeds in light and moderate traffic densities.

<title>Unlearning Sensitive Information in Multimodal LLMs: Benchmark and Attack-Defense Evaluation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01456</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.01456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs trained on massive datasets may inadvertently acquire sensitive information such as personal details and potentially harmful content. This risk is further heightened in multimodal LLMs as they integrate information from multiple modalities (image and text). Adversaries can exploit this knowledge through multimodal prompts to extract sensitive details. Evaluating how effectively MLLMs can forget such information (targeted unlearning) necessitates the creation of high-quality, well-annotated image-text pairs. While prior work on unlearning has focused on text, multimodal unlearning remains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce a multimodal unlearning benchmark, UnLOK-VQA (Unlearning Outside Knowledge VQA), as well as an attack-and-defense framework to evaluate methods for deleting specific multimodal knowledge from MLLMs. We extend a visual question-answering dataset using an automated pipeline that generates varying-proximity samples for testing generalization and specificity, followed by manual filtering for maintaining high quality. We then evaluate six defense objectives against seven attacks (four whitebox, three blackbox), including a novel whitebox method leveraging interpretability of hidden states. Our results show multimodal attacks outperform text- or image-only ones, and that the most effective defense removes answer information from internal model states. Additionally, larger models exhibit greater post-editing robustness, suggesting that scale enhances safety. UnLOK-VQA provides a rigorous benchmark for advancing unlearning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Navigation and manipulation are core capabilities in Embodied AI, yet training agents with these capabilities in the real world faces high costs and time complexity. Therefore, sim-to-real transfer has emerged as a key approach, yet the sim-to-real gap persists. This survey examines how physics simulators address this gap by analyzing their properties overlooked in previous surveys. We also analyze their features for navigation and manipulation tasks, along with hardware requirements. Additionally, we offer a resource with benchmark datasets, metrics, simulation platforms, and cutting-edge methods-such as world models and geometric equivariance-to help researchers select suitable tools while accounting for hardware constraints.

arXiv:2505.01459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces MoxE, a novel architecture that synergistically combines the Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to address critical scalability and efficiency challenges in large language models (LLMs). The proposed method effectively leverages xLSTM's innovative memory structures while strategically introducing sparsity through MoE to substantially reduce computational overhead. At the heart of our approach is a novel entropy-based routing mechanism, designed to dynamically route tokens to specialized experts, thereby ensuring efficient and balanced resource utilization. This entropy awareness enables the architecture to effectively manage both rare and common tokens, with mLSTM blocks being favored to handle rare tokens. To further enhance generalization, we introduce a suite of auxiliary losses, including entropy-based and group-wise balancing losses, ensuring robust performance and efficient training. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations rigorously demonstrate that MoxE achieves significant efficiency gains and enhanced effectiveness compared to existing approaches, marking a notable advancement in scalable LLM architectures.

Abstract: We present BiGSCoder, a novel encoder-only bidirectional state-space model (SSM) featuring a gated architecture, pre-trained for code understanding on a code dataset using masked language modeling. Our work aims to systematically evaluate SSMs' capabilities in coding tasks compared to traditional transformer architectures; BiGSCoder is built for this purpose. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse pre-training configurations and code understanding benchmarks, we demonstrate that BiGSCoder outperforms transformer-based models, despite utilizing simpler pre-training strategies and much less training data. Our results indicate that BiGSCoder can serve as a more sample-efficient alternative to conventional transformer models. Furthermore, our study shows that SSMs perform better without positional embeddings and can effectively extrapolate to longer sequences during fine-tuning.

<title>CostFilter-AD: Enhancing Anomaly Detection through Matching Cost Filtering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01476</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.01476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD.

Abstract: The rapid digitalization of communication systems has elevated Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technologies to become critical interfaces for customer engagement. With Artificial Intelligence (AI) now driving these platforms, ensuring secure, compliant, and ethically designed development practices is more imperative than ever. AI-powered IVRs leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to personalize interactions, automate service delivery, and optimize user experiences. However, these innovations expose systems to heightened risks, including data privacy breaches, AI decision opacity, and model security vulnerabilities. This paper analyzes the evolution of IVRs from static code-based designs to adaptive AI-driven systems, presenting a cybersecurity-centric perspective. We propose a practical governance framework that embeds agile security principles, compliance with global data legislation, and user-centric ethics. Emphasizing privacy-by-design, adaptive risk modeling, and transparency, the paper argues that ethical AI integration is not a feature but a strategic imperative. Through this multidimensional lens, we highlight how modern IVRs can transition from communication tools to intelligent, secure, and accountable digital frontlines-resilient against emerging threats and aligned with societal expectations.

Abstract: We propose a refined approach to efficiently fine-tune large language models (LLMs) on specific domains like the mathematical domain by employing a budgeted subset selection method. Our approach combines utility and diversity metrics to select the most informative and representative training examples. The final goal is to achieve near-full dataset performance with meticulously selected data points from the entire dataset while significantly reducing computational cost and training time and achieving competitive performance as the full dataset. The utility metric incorporates both perplexity and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) loss to identify challenging examples that contribute most to model learning, while the diversity metric ensures broad coverage across mathematical subdomains. We evaluate our method on LLaMA-3 8B and Phi-3 models, comparing against several baseline approaches, including random selection, diversity-based sampling, and existing state-of-the-art subset selection techniques.

<title>The DCR Delusion: Measuring the Privacy Risk of Synthetic Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01524</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.01524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data has become an increasingly popular way to share data without revealing sensitive information. Though Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are widely considered the gold standard for empirically assessing the privacy of a synthetic dataset, practitioners and researchers often rely on simpler proxy metrics such as Distance to Closest Record (DCR). These metrics estimate privacy by measuring the similarity between the training data and generated synthetic data. This similarity is also compared against that between the training data and a disjoint holdout set of real records to construct a binary privacy test. If the synthetic data is not more similar to the training data than the holdout set is, it passes the test and is considered private. In this work we show that, while computationally inexpensive, DCR and other distance-based metrics fail to identify privacy leakage. Across multiple datasets and both classical models such as Baynet and CTGAN and more recent diffusion models, we show that datasets deemed private by proxy metrics are highly vulnerable to MIAs. We similarly find both the binary privacy test and the continuous measure based on these metrics to be uninformative of actual membership inference risk. We further show that these failures are consistent across different metric hyperparameter settings and record selection methods. Finally, we argue DCR and other distance-based metrics to be flawed by design and show a example of a simple leakage they miss in practice. With this work, we hope to motivate practitioners to move away from proxy metrics to MIAs as the rigorous, comprehensive standard of evaluating privacy of synthetic data, in particular to make claims of datasets being legally anonymous.

<title>Automated Parsing of Engineering Drawings for Structured Information Extraction Using a Fine-tuned Document Understanding Transformer</title>

Abstract: Accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering drawings is crucial for high-precision manufacturing. Manual extraction is time-consuming and error-prone, while traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques often struggle with complex layouts and overlapping symbols, resulting in unstructured outputs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework for structured information extraction by integrating an oriented bounding box (OBB) detection model with a transformer-based document parsing model (Donut). An in-house annotated dataset is used to train YOLOv11 for detecting nine key categories: Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&amp;T), General Tolerances, Measures, Materials, Notes, Radii, Surface Roughness, Threads, and Title Blocks. Detected OBBs are cropped into images and labeled to fine-tune Donut for structured JSON output. Fine-tuning strategies include a single model trained across all categories and category-specific models. Results show that the single model consistently outperforms category-specific ones across all evaluation metrics, achieving higher precision (94.77% for GD&amp;T), recall (100% for most), and F1 score (97.3%), while reducing hallucination (5.23%). The proposed framework improves accuracy, reduces manual effort, and supports scalable deployment in precision-driven industries.

arXiv:2505.01531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first generalizable and fully data-driven adaptive framework designed to stabilize deep learning (DL) autoregressive forecasting models over long time horizons, with the goal of reducing the computational cost required in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.The proposed methodology alternates between two phases: (i) predicting the evolution of the flow field over a selected time interval using a trained DL model, and (ii) updating the model with newly generated CFD data when stability degrades, thus maintaining accurate long-term forecasting. This adaptive retraining strategy ensures robustness while avoiding the accumulation of predictive errors typical in autoregressive models. The framework is validated across three increasingly complex flow regimes, from laminar to turbulent, demonstrating from 30 \% to 95 \% reduction in computational cost without compromising physical consistency or accuracy. Its entirely data-driven nature makes it easily adaptable to a wide range of time-dependent simulation problems. The code implementing this methodology is available as open-source and it will be integrated into the upcoming release of the ModelFLOWs-app.

At the intersection of artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction, affective computing is emerging with innovative solutions where machines are humanized by enabling them to process and respond to user emotions. This survey paper explores recent research contributions in affective computing applications in the area of emotion recognition, sentiment analysis and personality assignment developed using approaches like large language models (LLMs), multimodal techniques, and personalized AI systems. We analyze the key contributions and innovative methodologies applied by the selected research papers by categorizing them into four domains: AI chatbot applications, multimodal input systems, mental health and therapy applications, and affective computing for safety applications. We then highlight the technological strengths as well as the research gaps and challenges related to these studies. Furthermore, the paper examines the datasets used in each study, highlighting how modality, scale, and diversity impact the development and performance of affective models. Finally, the survey outlines ethical considerations and proposes future directions to develop applications that are more safe, empathetic and practical.

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of foundation models, we do not have a systematic characterization of the representations that these models learn. In this paper, we establish the contexture theory. It shows that a large class of representation learning methods can be characterized as learning from the association between the input and a context variable. Specifically, we show that many popular methods aim to approximate the top-d singular functions of the expectation operator induced by the context, in which case we say that the representation learns the contexture. We demonstrate the generality of the contexture theory by proving that representation learning within various learning paradigms -- supervised, self-supervised, and manifold learning -- can all be studied from such a perspective. We also prove that the representations that learn the contexture are optimal on those tasks that are compatible with the context. One important implication of the contexture theory is that once the model is large enough to approximate the top singular functions, further scaling up the model size yields diminishing returns. Therefore, scaling is not all we need, and further improvement requires better contexts. To this end, we study how to evaluate the usefulness of a context without knowing the downstream tasks. We propose a metric and show by experiments that it correlates well with the actual performance of the encoder on many real datasets.

Abstract: Understanding causal event relationships and achieving fine-grained temporal grounding in videos remain challenging for vision-language models. Existing methods either compress video tokens to reduce temporal resolution, or treat videos as unsegmented streams, which obscures fine-grained event boundaries and limits the modeling of causal dependencies. We propose TEMPURA (Temporal Event Masked Prediction and Understanding for Reasoning in Action), a two-stage training framework that enhances video temporal understanding. TEMPURA first applies masked event prediction reasoning to reconstruct missing events and generate step-by-step causal explanations from dense event annotations, drawing inspiration from effective infilling techniques. TEMPURA then learns to perform video segmentation and dense captioning to decompose videos into non-overlapping events with detailed, timestamp-aligned descriptions. We train TEMPURA on VER, a large-scale dataset curated by us that comprises 1M training instances and 500K videos with temporally aligned event descriptions and structured reasoning steps. Experiments on temporal grounding and highlight detection benchmarks demonstrate that TEMPURA outperforms strong baseline models, confirming that integrating causal reasoning with fine-grained temporal segmentation leads to improved video understanding.

Abstract: Adapting to non-stationary network conditions presents significant challenges for resource adaptation. However, current solutions primarily rely on stationary assumptions. While data-driven reinforcement learning approaches offer promising solutions for handling network dynamics, our systematic investigation reveals a critical limitation: neural networks suffer from plasticity loss, significantly impeding their ability to adapt to evolving network conditions. Through theoretical analysis of neural propagation mechanisms, we demonstrate that existing dormant neuron metrics inadequately characterize neural plasticity loss. To address this limitation, we have developed the Silent Neuron theory, which provides a more comprehensive framework for understanding plasticity degradation. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose the Reset Silent Neuron (ReSiN), which preserves neural plasticity through strategic neuron resets guided by both forward and backward propagation states. In our implementation of an adaptive video streaming system, ReSiN has shown significant improvements over existing solutions, achieving up to 168% higher bitrate and 108% better quality of experience (QoE) while maintaining comparable smoothness. Furthermore, ReSiN consistently outperforms in stationary environments, demonstrating its robust adaptability across different network conditions.

arXiv:2505.01592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in instruction-following and context-understanding lead to the era of agents with numerous applications. Among these, task planning agents have become especially prominent in realistic scenarios involving complex internal pipelines, such as context understanding, tool management, and response generation. However, existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate agent performance based on task completion as a proxy for overall effectiveness. We hypothesize that merely improving task completion is misaligned with maximizing user satisfaction, as users interact with the entire agentic process and not only the end result. To address this gap, we propose PIPA, a unified evaluation protocol that conceptualizes the behavioral process of interactive task planning agents within a partially observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) paradigm. The proposed protocol offers a comprehensive assessment of agent performance through a set of atomic evaluation criteria, allowing researchers and practitioners to diagnose specific strengths and weaknesses within the agent's decision-making pipeline. Our analyses show that agents excel in different behavioral stages, with user satisfaction shaped by both outcomes and intermediate behaviors. We also highlight future directions, including systems that leverage multiple agents and the limitations of user simulators in task planning.

Abstract: We present a state-of-the-art model for fine-grained probability estimation of propositions conditioned on context. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, particularly on well-defined tasks with complete information. However, LLMs continue to struggle with making accurate and well-calibrated probabilistic predictions under uncertainty or partial information. While incorporating uncertainty into model predictions often boosts performance, obtaining reliable estimates of that uncertainty remains understudied. In particular, LLM probability estimates tend to be coarse and biased towards more frequent numbers. Through a combination of human and synthetic data creation and assessment, scaling to larger models, and better supervision, we propose a set of strong and precise probability estimation models. We conduct systematic evaluations across tasks that rely on conditional probability estimation and show that our approach consistently outperforms existing fine-tuned and prompting-based methods by a large margin.

Real world sea trials confirm the methods effectiveness even in adverse weather and complex maritime settings.

Abstract: We study compute efficiency of LLM training when using different parameterizations, i.e., rules for adjusting model and optimizer hyperparameters (HPs) as model size changes. Some parameterizations fail to transfer optimal base HPs (such as learning rate) across changes in model depth, requiring practitioners to either re-tune these HPs as they scale up (expensive), or accept sub-optimal training when re-tuning is prohibitive. Even when they achieve HP transfer, we develop theory to show parameterizations may still exist in the lazy learning regime where layers learn only features close to their linearization, preventing effective use of depth and nonlinearity. Finally, we identify and adopt the unique parameterization we call CompleteP that achieves both depth-wise HP transfer and non-lazy learning in all layers. CompleteP enables a wider range of model width/depth ratios to remain compute-efficient, unlocking shapes better suited for different hardware settings and operational contexts. Moreover, CompleteP enables 12-34\% compute efficiency improvements over the prior state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) aims to ensure safety when an RL agent conducts learning by interacting with real-world environments where improper actions can induce high costs or lead to severe consequences. In this paper, we propose a novel Safe Skill Planning (SSkP) approach to enhance effective safe RL by exploiting auxiliary offline demonstration data. SSkP involves a two-stage process. First, we employ PU learning to learn a skill risk predictor from the offline demonstration data. Then, based on the learned skill risk predictor, we develop a novel risk planning process to enhance online safe RL and learn a risk-averse safe policy efficiently through interactions with the online RL environment, while simultaneously adapting the skill risk predictor to the environment. We conduct experiments in several benchmark robotic simulation environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art safe RL methods.

Abstract: Addressing the detrimental impact of non-stationary environmental noise on automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been a persistent and significant research focus. Despite advancements, this challenge continues to be a major concern. Recently, data-driven supervised approaches, such as deep neural networks, have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional unsupervised methods. With extensive training, these approaches have the potential to overcome the challenges posed by diverse real-life acoustic environments. In this light, this paper introduces a novel neural framework that incorporates a robust frontend into ASR systems in both clean and noisy environments. Utilizing the Aurora-2 speech database, the authors evaluate the effectiveness of an acoustic feature set for Mel-frequency, employing the approach of transfer learning based on Residual neural network (ResNet). The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in recognition accuracy compared to convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. They achieved accuracies of 98.94% in clean and 91.21% in noisy mode.

Abstract: Although inspired by neuronal systems in the brain, artificial neural networks generally employ point-neurons, which offer far less computational complexity than their biological counterparts. Neurons have dendritic arbors that connect to different sets of synapses and offer local non-linear accumulation - playing a pivotal role in processing and learning. Inspired by this, we propose a novel neuron design based on a multi-gate ferroelectric field-effect transistor that mimics dendrites. It leverages ferroelectric nonlinearity for local computations within dendritic branches, while utilizing the transistor action to generate the final neuronal output. The branched architecture paves the way for utilizing smaller crossbar arrays in hardware integration, leading to greater efficiency. Using an experimentally calibrated device-circuit-algorithm co-simulation framework, we demonstrate that networks incorporating our dendritic neurons achieve superior performance in comparison to much larger networks without dendrites ($\sim$17$\times$ fewer trainable weight parameters). These findings suggest that dendritic hardware can significantly improve computational efficiency, and learning capacity of neuromorphic systems optimized for edge applications.

Abstract: High-fidelity wildfire monitoring using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) typically requires multimodal sensing - especially RGB and thermal imagery - which increases hardware cost and power consumption. This paper introduces SAM-TIFF, a novel teacher-student distillation framework for pixel-level wildfire temperature prediction and segmentation using RGB input only. A multimodal teacher network trained on paired RGB-Thermal imagery and radiometric TIFF ground truth distills knowledge to a unimodal RGB student network, enabling thermal-sensor-free inference. Segmentation supervision is generated using a hybrid approach of segment anything (SAM)-guided mask generation, and selection via TOPSIS, along with Canny edge detection and Otsu's thresholding pipeline for automatic point prompt selection. Our method is the first to perform per-pixel temperature regression from RGB UAV data, demonstrating strong generalization on the recent FLAME 3 dataset. This work lays the foundation for lightweight, cost-effective UAV-based wildfire monitoring systems without thermal sensors.

Abstract: Different from single-objective evolutionary algorithms, where non-elitism is an established concept, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms almost always select the next population in a greedy fashion. In the only notable exception, Bian, Zhou, Li, and Qian (IJCAI 2023) proposed a stochastic selection mechanism for the SMS-EMOA and proved that it can speed up computing the Pareto front of the bi-objective jump benchmark with problem size $n$ and gap parameter $k$ by a factor of $\max\{1,2^{k/4}/n\}$. While this constitutes the first proven speed-up from non-elitist selection, suggesting a very interesting research direction, it has to be noted that a true speed-up only occurs for $k \ge 4\log_2(n)$, where the runtime is super-polynomial, and that the advantage reduces for larger numbers of objectives as shown in a later work. In this work, we propose a different non-elitist selection mechanism based on aging, which exempts individuals younger than a certain age from a possible removal. This remedies the two shortcomings of stochastic selection: We prove a speed-up by a factor of $\max\{1,\Theta(k)^{k-1}\}$, regardless of the number of objectives. In particular, a positive speed-up can already be observed for constant $k$, the only setting for which polynomial runtimes can be witnessed. Overall, this result supports the use of non-elitist selection schemes, but suggests that aging-based mechanisms can be considerably more powerful than stochastic selection mechanisms.

Abstract: Fair machine learning seeks to identify and mitigate biases in predictions against unfavorable populations characterized by demographic attributes, such as race and gender. Recently, a few works have extended fairness to graph data, such as social networks, but most of them neglect the causal relationships among data instances. This paper addresses the prevalent challenge in fairness-aware ML algorithms, which typically assume Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data. We tackle the overlooked domain of non-IID, graph-based settings where data instances are interconnected, influencing the outcomes of fairness interventions. We base our research on the Network Structural Causal Model (NSCM) framework and posit two main assumptions: Decomposability and Graph Independence, which enable the computation of interventional distributions in non-IID settings using the $do$-calculus. Based on that, we develop the Message Passing Variational Autoencoder for Causal Inference (MPVA) to compute interventional distributions and facilitate causally fair node classification through estimated interventional distributions. Empirical evaluations on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MPVA outperforms conventional methods by effectively approximating interventional distributions and mitigating bias. The implications of our findings underscore the potential of causality-based fairness in complex ML applications, setting the stage for further research into relaxing the initial assumptions to enhance model fairness.

<title>Soft-Masked Semi-Dual Optimal Transport for Partial Domain Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Visual domain adaptation aims to learn discriminative and domain-invariant representation for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging knowledge from a labeled source domain. Partial domain adaptation (PDA) is a general and practical scenario in which the target label space is a subset of the source one. The challenges of PDA exist due to not only domain shift but also the non-identical label spaces of domains. In this paper, a Soft-masked Semi-dual Optimal Transport (SSOT) method is proposed to deal with the PDA problem. Specifically, the class weights of domains are estimated, and then a reweighed source domain is constructed, which is favorable in conducting class-conditional distribution matching with the target domain. A soft-masked transport distance matrix is constructed by category predictions, which will enhance the class-oriented representation ability of optimal transport in the shared feature space. To deal with large-scale optimal transport problems, the semi-dual formulation of the entropy-regularized Kantorovich problem is employed since it can be optimized by gradient-based algorithms. Further, a neural network is exploited to approximate the Kantorovich potential due to its strong fitting ability. This network parametrization also allows the generalization of the dual variable outside the supports of the input distribution. The SSOT model is built upon neural networks, which can be optimized alternately in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of SSOT.

Abstract: Manual scoring of the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) for upper extremity assessment in stroke rehabilitation is time-intensive and variable. We propose an automated ARAT scoring system integrating multimodal video analysis with SlowFast, I3D, and Transformer-based models using OpenPose keypoints and object locations. Our approach employs multi-view data (ipsilateral, contralateral, and top perspectives), applying early and late fusion to combine features across views and models. Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBMs) infer movement quality components, enhancing interpretability. A clinician dashboard displays task scores, execution times, and quality assessments. We conducted a study with five clinicians who reviewed 500 video ratings generated by our system, providing feedback on its accuracy and usability. Evaluated on a stroke rehabilitation dataset, our framework achieves 89.0% validation accuracy with late fusion, with HBMs aligning closely with manual assessments. This work advances automated rehabilitation by offering a scalable, interpretable solution with clinical validation.

Abstract: Efficiently adapting large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for few-shot learning poses challenges in balancing pre-trained knowledge retention and task-specific adaptation. Existing methods often overlook valuable structural information within the VLM's latent space. We introduce a topology-aware tuning approach integrating Representation Topology Divergence (RTD) into the Task Residual (TR) framework. By explicitly aligning the topological structures of visual and text representations using a combined RTD and Cross-Entropy loss, while freezing base VLM encoders, our method enhances few-shot performance. We optimize only lightweight Task Residual parameters, effectively leveraging topological information. Across 6 diverse benchmark datasets, our approach demonstrates significant gains, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 1-2\% over relevant baseline methods in few-shot settings. This work presents an effective strategy to boost VLM few-shot capabilities by incorporating topological alignment.

Abstract: Integrating heterogeneous biomedical data including imaging, omics, and clinical records supports accurate diagnosis and personalised care. Graph-based models fuse such non-Euclidean data by capturing spatial and relational structure, yet clinical uptake requires regulator-ready interpretability. We present the first technical survey of interpretable graph based models for multimodal biomedical data, covering 26 studies published between Jan 2019 and Sep 2024. Most target disease classification, notably cancer and rely on static graphs from simple similarity measures, while graph-native explainers are rare; post-hoc methods adapted from non-graph domains such as gradient saliency, and SHAP predominate. We group existing approaches into four interpretability families, outline trends such as graph-in-graph hierarchies, knowledge-graph edges, and dynamic topology learning, and perform a practical benchmark. Using an Alzheimer disease cohort, we compare Sensitivity Analysis, Gradient Saliency, SHAP and Graph Masking. SHAP and Sensitivity Analysis recover the broadest set of known AD pathways and Gene-Ontology terms, whereas Gradient Saliency and Graph Masking surface complementary metabolic and transport signatures. Permutation tests show all four beat random gene sets, but with distinct trade-offs: SHAP and Graph Masking offer deeper biology at higher compute cost, while Gradient Saliency and Sensitivity Analysis are quicker though coarser. We also provide a step-by-step flowchart covering graph construction, explainer choice and resource budgeting to help researchers balance transparency and performance. This review synthesises the state of interpretable graph learning for multimodal medicine, benchmarks leading techniques, and charts future directions, from advanced XAI tools to under-studied diseases, serving as a concise reference for method developers and translational scientists.

<title>Component-Based Fairness in Face Attribute Classification with Bayesian Network-informed Meta Learning</title>

Abstract: The widespread integration of face recognition technologies into various applications (e.g., access control and personalized advertising) necessitates a critical emphasis on fairness. While previous efforts have focused on demographic fairness, the fairness of individual biological face components remains unexplored. In this paper, we focus on face component fairness, a fairness notion defined by biological face features. To our best knowledge, our work is the first work to mitigate bias of face attribute prediction at the biological feature level. In this work, we identify two key challenges in optimizing face component fairness: attribute label scarcity and attribute inter-dependencies, both of which limit the effectiveness of bias mitigation from previous approaches. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{B}ayesian \textbf{N}etwork-informed \textbf{M}eta \textbf{R}eweighting (BNMR), which incorporates a Bayesian Network calibrator to guide an adaptive meta-learning-based sample reweighting process. During the training process of our approach, the Bayesian Network calibrator dynamically tracks model bias and encodes prior probabilities for face component attributes to overcome the above challenges. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world human face dataset. Our results show that BNMR is able to consistently outperform recent face bias mitigation baselines. Moreover, our results suggest a positive impact of face component fairness on the commonly considered demographic fairness (e.g., \textit{gender}). Our findings pave the way for new research avenues on face component fairness, suggesting that face component fairness could serve as a potential surrogate objective for demographic fairness. The code for our work is publicly available~\footnote{https://github.com/yliuaa/BNMR-FairCompFace.git}.

Abstract: Operating robots in open-ended scenarios with diverse tasks is a crucial research and application direction in robotics. While recent progress in natural language processing and large multimodal models has enhanced robots' ability to understand complex instructions, robot manipulation still faces the procedural skill dilemma and the declarative skill dilemma in open environments. Existing methods often compromise cognitive and executive capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose RoBridge, a hierarchical intelligent architecture for general robotic manipulation. It consists of a high-level cognitive planner (HCP) based on a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), an invariant operable representation (IOR) serving as a symbolic bridge, and a generalist embodied agent (GEA). RoBridge maintains the declarative skill of VLM and unleashes the procedural skill of reinforcement learning, effectively bridging the gap between cognition and execution. RoBridge demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines, achieving a 75% success rate on new tasks and an 83% average success rate in sim-to-real generalization using only five real-world data samples per task. This work represents a significant step towards integrating cognitive reasoning with physical execution in robotic systems, offering a new paradigm for general robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been put forward as an energy-efficient alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) since they perform sparse Accumulate operations instead of the power-hungry Multiply-and-Accumulate operations. ANN-SNN conversion is a widely used method to realize deep SNNs with accuracy comparable to that of ANNs.~\citeauthor{bu2023optimal} recently proposed the Quantization-Clip-Floor-Shift (QCFS) activation as an alternative to ReLU to minimize the accuracy loss during ANN-SNN conversion. Nevertheless, SNN inferencing requires a large number of timesteps to match the accuracy of the source ANN for real-world datasets. In this work, we propose PASCAL, which performs ANN-SNN conversion in such a way that the resulting SNN is mathematically equivalent to an ANN with QCFS-activation, thereby yielding similar accuracy as the source ANN with minimal inference timesteps. In addition, we propose a systematic method to configure the quantization step of QCFS activation in a layerwise manner, which effectively determines the optimal number of timesteps per layer for the converted SNN. Our results show that the ResNet-34 SNN obtained using PASCAL achieves an accuracy of $\approx$74\% on ImageNet with a 64$\times$ reduction in the number of inference timesteps compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Pruning large language models (LLMs) is a promising solution for reducing model sizes and computational complexity while preserving performance. Traditional layer-wise pruning methods often adopt a uniform sparsity approach across all layers, which leads to suboptimal performance due to the varying significance of individual transformer layers within the model not being accounted for. To this end, we propose the \underline{S}hapley \underline{V}alue-based \underline{N}on-\underline{U}niform \underline{P}runing (\methodname{}) method for LLMs. This approach quantifies the contribution of each transformer layer to the overall model performance, enabling the assignment of tailored pruning budgets to different layers to retain critical parameters. To further improve efficiency, we design the Sliding Window-based Shapley Value approximation method. It substantially reduces computational overhead compared to exact SV calculation methods. Extensive experiments on various LLMs including LLaMA-v1, LLaMA-v2 and OPT demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results reveal that non-uniform pruning significantly enhances the performance of pruned models. Notably, \methodname{} achieves a reduction in perplexity (PPL) of 18.01\% and 19.55\% on LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B, respectively, compared to SparseGPT at 70\% sparsity.

Abstract: Accurately modeling and forecasting complex systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is crucial in various scientific and engineering domains. However, traditional numerical methods struggle in real-world scenarios due to incomplete or unknown physical laws. Meanwhile, machine learning approaches often fail to generalize effectively when faced with scarce observational data and the challenge of capturing local and global features. To this end, we propose the Physics-encoded Spectral Attention Network (PeSANet), which integrates local and global information to forecast complex systems with limited data and incomplete physical priors. The model consists of two key components: a physics-encoded block that uses hard constraints to approximate local differential operators from limited data, and a spectral-enhanced block that captures long-range global dependencies in the frequency domain. Specifically, we introduce a novel spectral attention mechanism to model inter-spectrum relationships and learn long-range spatial features. Experimental results demonstrate that PeSANet outperforms existing methods across all metrics, particularly in long-term forecasting accuracy, providing a promising solution for simulating complex systems with limited data and incomplete physics.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) offer the potential to surpass conventional labeling by generating richer, more detailed descriptions of on-device human behavior understanding (HBU) in low-resolution vision systems, such as depth, thermal, and infrared. However, existing large vision language model (LVLM) approaches are unable to understand low-resolution data well as they are primarily designed for high-resolution data, such as RGB images. A quick fixing approach is to caption a large amount of low-resolution data, but it requires a significant amount of labor-intensive annotation efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel, labor-saving system, Llambda, designed to support low-resolution HBU. The core idea is to leverage limited labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to guide LLMs in generating informative captions, which can be combined with raw data to effectively fine-tune LVLM models for understanding low-resolution videos in HBU. First, we propose a Contrastive-Oriented Data Labeler, which can capture behavior-relevant information from long, low-resolution videos and generate high-quality pseudo labels for unlabeled data via contrastive learning. Second, we propose a Physical-Knowledge Guided Captioner, which utilizes spatial and temporal consistency checks to mitigate errors in pseudo labels. Therefore, it can improve LLMs' understanding of sequential data and then generate high-quality video captions. Finally, to ensure on-device deployability, we employ LoRA-based efficient fine-tuning to adapt LVLMs for low-resolution data. We evaluate Llambda using a region-scale real-world testbed and three distinct low-resolution datasets, and the experiments show that Llambda outperforms several state-of-the-art LVLM systems up to $40.03\%$ on average Bert-Score.

Abstract: In closed-loop distributed multi-sensor integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, performance often hinges on transmitting high-dimensional sensor observations over rate-limited networks. In this paper, we first present a general framework for rate-limited closed-loop distributed ISAC systems, and then propose an autoencoder-based observation compression method to overcome the constraints imposed by limited transmission capacity. Building on this framework, we conduct a case study using a closed-loop linear quadratic regulator (LQR) system to analyze how the interplay among observation, compression, and state dimensions affects reconstruction accuracy, state estimation error, and control performance. In multi-sensor scenarios, our results further show that optimal resource allocation initially prioritizes low-noise sensors until the compression becomes lossless, after which resources are reallocated to high-noise sensors.

Abstract: The sensitivity to input parameters and lack of flexibility limits the traditional Mean-Variance model. In contrast, the Black-Litterman model has attracted widespread attention by integrating market equilibrium returns with investors' subjective views. This paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning model combining Singular Spectrum analysis (SSA), Multivariate Aligned Empirical Mode Decomposition (MA-EMD), and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), aiming to improve the prediction accuracy of asset prices and thus enhance the ability of the Black-Litterman model to generate subjective views. Experimental results show that noise reduction pre-processing can improve the model's accuracy, and the prediction performance of the proposed model is significantly better than that of three multivariate decomposition benchmark models. We construct an investment portfolio by using 20 representative stocks from the NASDAQ 100 index. By combining the hybrid forecasting model with the Black-Litterman model, the generated investment portfolio exhibits better returns and risk control capabilities than the Mean-Variance, Equal-Weighted, and Market-Weighted models in the short holding period.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving educational landscape, the unbiased assessment of soft skills is a significant challenge, particularly in higher education. This paper presents a fuzzy logic approach that employs a Granular Linguistic Model of Phenomena integrated with multimodal analysis to evaluate soft skills in undergraduate students. By leveraging computational perceptions, this approach enables a structured breakdown of complex soft skill expressions, capturing nuanced behaviours with high granularity and addressing their inherent uncertainties, thereby enhancing interpretability and reliability. Experiments were conducted with undergraduate students using a developed tool that assesses soft skills such as decision-making, communication, and creativity. This tool identifies and quantifies subtle aspects of human interaction, such as facial expressions and gesture recognition. The findings reveal that the framework effectively consolidates multiple data inputs to produce meaningful and consistent assessments of soft skills, showing that integrating multiple modalities into the evaluation process significantly improves the quality of soft skills scores, making the assessment work transparent and understandable to educational stakeholders.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of AI-generated texts highlights the urgent need for accurate and transparent detection tools, especially in educational settings, where verifying authorship is essential. Existing literature has demonstrated that the application of stylometric features with machine learning classifiers can yield excellent results. Building on this foundation, this study proposes a comprehensive framework that integrates stylometric analysis with psycholinguistic theories, offering a clear and interpretable approach to distinguishing between AI-generated and human-written texts. This research specifically maps 31 distinct stylometric features to cognitive processes such as lexical retrieval, discourse planning, cognitive load management, and metacognitive self-monitoring. In doing so, it highlights the unique psycholinguistic patterns found in human writing. Through the intersection of computational linguistics and cognitive science, this framework contributes to the development of reliable tools aimed at preserving academic integrity in the era of generative AI.

Abstract: Humans and intelligent animals can effortlessly internalize new information ("news") and accurately extract the implications for performing downstream tasks. While large language models (LLMs) can achieve this through in-context learning (ICL) when the news is explicitly given as context, fine-tuning remains challenging for the models to consolidate learning in weights. In this paper, we introduce $\textit{New News}$, a dataset composed of hypothetical yet plausible news spanning multiple domains (mathematics, coding, discoveries, leaderboards, events), accompanied by downstream evaluation questions whose correct answers critically depend on understanding and internalizing the news. We first demonstrate a substantial gap between naive fine-tuning and in-context learning (FT-ICL gap) on our news dataset. To address this gap, we explore a suite of self-play data generation protocols -- paraphrases, implications and Self-QAs -- designed to distill the knowledge from the model with context into the weights of the model without the context, which we term $\textit{System-2 Fine-tuning}$ (Sys2-FT). We systematically evaluate ICL and Sys2-FT performance across data domains and model scales with the Qwen 2.5 family of models. Our results demonstrate that the self-QA protocol of Sys2-FT significantly improves models' in-weight learning of the news. Furthermore, we discover the $\textit{contexual shadowing effect}$, where training with the news $\textit{in context}$ followed by its rephrases or QAs degrade learning of the news. Finally, we show preliminary evidence of an emerging scaling law of Sys2-FT.

Abstract: Conditional decision generation with diffusion models has shown powerful competitiveness in reinforcement learning (RL). Recent studies reveal the relation between energy-function-guidance diffusion models and constrained RL problems. The main challenge lies in estimating the intermediate energy, which is intractable due to the log-expectation formulation during the generation process. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Energy-guided Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, we first provide a theoretical analysis and the closed-form solution of the intermediate guidance when the diffusion model obeys the conditional Gaussian transformation. Then, we analyze the posterior Gaussian distribution in the log-expectation formulation and obtain the target estimation of the log-expectation under mild assumptions. Finally, we train an intermediate energy neural network to approach the target estimation of log-expectation formulation. We apply our method in 30+ offline RL tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method surpasses numerous representative baselines in D4RL offline reinforcement learning benchmarks.

Abstract: Collecting large-scale crop disease images in the field is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Generative models (GMs) offer an alternative by creating synthetic samples that resemble real-world images. However, existing research primarily relies on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)-based image-to-image translation and lack a comprehensive analysis of computational requirements in agriculture. Therefore, this research explores a multi-modal text-to-image approach for generating synthetic crop disease images and is the first to provide computational benchmarking in this context. We trained three Stable Diffusion (SD) variants-SDXL, SD3.5M (medium), and SD3.5L (large)-and fine-tuned them using Dreambooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning techniques to enhance generalization. SD3.5M outperformed the others, with an average memory usage of 18 GB, power consumption of 180 W, and total energy use of 1.02 kWh/500 images (0.002 kWh per image) during inference task. Our results demonstrate SD3.5M's ability to generate 500 synthetic images from just 36 in-field samples in 1.5 hours. We recommend SD3.5M for efficient crop disease data generation.

<title>Accelerating Volumetric Medical Image Annotation via Short-Long Memory SAM 2</title>

Abstract: Manual annotation of volumetric medical images, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Recent advancements in foundation models for video object segmentation, such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), offer a potential opportunity to significantly speed up the annotation process by manually annotating one or a few slices and then propagating target masks across the entire volume. However, the performance of SAM 2 in this context varies. Our experiments show that relying on a single memory bank and attention module is prone to error propagation, particularly at boundary regions where the target is present in the previous slice but absent in the current one. To address this problem, we propose Short-Long Memory SAM 2 (SLM-SAM 2), a novel architecture that integrates distinct short-term and long-term memory banks with separate attention modules to improve segmentation accuracy. We evaluate SLM-SAM 2 on three public datasets covering organs, bones, and muscles across MRI and CT modalities. We show that the proposed method markedly outperforms the default SAM 2, achieving average Dice Similarity Coefficient improvement of 0.14 and 0.11 in the scenarios when 5 volumes and 1 volume are available for the initial adaptation, respectively. SLM-SAM 2 also exhibits stronger resistance to over-propagation, making a notable step toward more accurate automated annotation of medical images for segmentation model development.

Abstract: Transformer models have established new benchmarks in natural language processing; however, their increasing depth results in substantial growth in parameter counts. While existing recurrent transformer methods address this issue by reprocessing layers multiple times, they often apply recurrence indiscriminately across entire blocks of layers. In this work, we investigate Intra-Layer Recurrence (ILR), a more targeted approach that applies recurrence selectively to individual layers within a single forward pass. Our experiments show that allocating more iterations to earlier layers yields optimal results. These findings suggest that ILR offers a promising direction for optimizing recurrent structures in transformer architectures.

Abstract: This study investigates whether individuals can learn to accurately discriminate between human-written and AI-produced texts when provided with immediate feedback, and if they can use this feedback to recalibrate their self-perceived competence. We also explore the specific criteria individuals rely upon when making these decisions, focusing on textual style and perceived readability.
  We used GPT-4o to generate several hundred texts across various genres and text types comparable to Koditex, a multi-register corpus of human-written texts. We then presented randomized text pairs to 255 Czech native speakers who identified which text was human-written and which was AI-generated. Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: one receiving immediate feedback after each trial, the other receiving no feedback until experiment completion. We recorded accuracy in identification, confidence levels, response times, and judgments about text readability along with demographic data and participants' engagement with AI technologies prior to the experiment.
  Participants receiving immediate feedback showed significant improvement in accuracy and confidence calibration. Participants initially held incorrect assumptions about AI-generated text features, including expectations about stylistic rigidity and readability. Notably, without feedback, participants made the most errors precisely when feeling most confident -- an issue largely resolved among the feedback group.
  The ability to differentiate between human and AI-generated texts can be effectively learned through targeted training with explicit feedback, which helps correct misconceptions about AI stylistic features and readability, as well as potential other variables that were not explored, while facilitating more accurate self-assessment. This finding might be particularly important in educational contexts.

Abstract: Robust navigation in diverse environments and domains requires both accurate state estimation and transparent decision making. We present PhysNav-DG, a novel framework that integrates classical sensor fusion with the semantic power of vision-language models. Our dual-branch architecture predicts navigation actions from multi-sensor inputs while simultaneously generating detailed chain-of-thought explanations. A modified Adaptive Kalman Filter dynamically adjusts its noise parameters based on environmental context. It leverages several streams of raw sensor data along with semantic insights from models such as LLaMA 3.2 11B and BLIP-2. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the MD-NEX Benchmark, a novel multi-domain dataset that unifies indoor navigation, autonomous driving, and social navigation tasks with ground-truth actions and human-validated explanations. Extensive experiments and ablations show that PhysNav-DG improves navigation success rates by over 20% and achieves high efficiency, with explanations that are both highly grounded and clear. This work connects high-level semantic reasoning and geometric planning for safer and more trustworthy autonomous systems.

<title>Adversarial Robustness of Deep Learning Models for Inland Water Body Segmentation from SAR Images</title>

Abstract: Inland water body segmentation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is an important task needed for several applications, such as flood mapping. While SAR sensors capture data in all-weather conditions as high-resolution images, differentiating water and water-like surfaces from SAR images is not straightforward. Inland water bodies, such as large river basins, have complex geometry, which adds to the challenge of segmentation. U-Net is a widely used deep learning model for land-water segmentation of SAR images. In practice, manual annotation is often used to generate the corresponding water masks as ground truth. Manual annotation of the images is prone to label noise owing to data poisoning attacks, especially due to complex geometry. In this work, we simulate manual errors in the form of adversarial attacks on the U-Net model and study the robustness of the model to human errors in annotation. Our results indicate that U-Net can tolerate a certain level of corruption before its performance drops significantly. This finding highlights the crucial role that the quality of manual annotations plays in determining the effectiveness of the segmentation model. The code and the new dataset, along with adversarial examples for robust training, are publicly available. (Github link - https://github.com/GVCL/IWSeg-SAR-Poison.git)

Abstract: With $700$ stars on GitHub and part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX Optimizer consists of the standard method to apply graph-based optimizations on ONNX models. However, its ability to preserve model accuracy across optimizations, has not been rigorously explored. We propose OODTE, a utility to automatically and thoroughly assess the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE follows a simple, yet effective differential testing and evaluation approach that can be easily adopted to other compiler optimizers. In particular, OODTE utilizes a number of ONNX models, then optimizes them and executes both the original and the optimized variants across a user-defined set of inputs, while automatically logging any issues with the optimization process. Finally, for successfully optimized models, OODTE compares the results, and, if any accuracy deviations are observed, it iteratively repeats the process for each pass of the ONNX Optimizer, to localize the root cause of the differences observed. Using OODTE, we sourced well-known $130$ models from the official ONNX Model Hub, used for a wide variety of tasks (classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question and answering, sentiment analysis) from the official ONNX model hub. We detected 15 issues, 14 of which were previously unknown, associated with optimizer crashes and accuracy deviations. We also observed $9.2$% of all model instances presenting issues leading into the crash of the optimizer, or the generation of an invalid model while using the primary optimizer strategies. In addition, $30$% of the classification models presented accuracy differences across the original and the optimized model variants, while $16.6$% of semantic segmentation and object detection models are also affected, at least to a limited extent.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate distractors for multiple-choice questions (MCQs), especially in domains like math education. However, existing approaches are limited in ensuring that the generated distractors are consistent with common student errors. We propose LookAlike, a method that improves error-distractor consistency via preference optimization. Our two main innovations are: (a) mining synthetic preference pairs from model inconsistencies, and (b) alternating supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to stabilize training. Unlike prior work that relies on heuristics or manually annotated preference data, LookAlike uses its own generation inconsistencies as dispreferred samples, thus enabling scalable and stable training. Evaluated on a real-world dataset of 1,400+ math MCQs, LookAlike achieves 51.6% accuracy in distractor generation and 57.2% in error generation under LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, outperforming an existing state-of-the-art method (45.6% / 47.7%). These improvements highlight the effectiveness of preference-based regularization and inconsistency mining for generating consistent math MCQ distractors at scale.

Abstract: Advances in deep learning and generative modeling have driven interest in data-driven molecule discovery pipelines, whereby machine learning (ML) models are used to filter and design novel molecules without requiring prohibitively expensive first-principles simulations. Although the discovery of novel molecules that extend the boundaries of known chemistry requires accurate out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions, ML models often struggle to generalize OOD. Furthermore, there are currently no systematic benchmarks for molecular OOD prediction tasks. We present BOOM, $\boldsymbol{b}$enchmarks for $\boldsymbol{o}$ut-$\boldsymbol{o}$f-distribution $\boldsymbol{m}$olecular property predictions -- a benchmark study of property-based out-of-distribution models for common molecular property prediction models. We evaluate more than 140 combinations of models and property prediction tasks to benchmark deep learning models on their OOD performance. Overall, we do not find any existing models that achieve strong OOD generalization across all tasks: even the top performing model exhibited an average OOD error 3x larger than in-distribution. We find that deep learning models with high inductive bias can perform well on OOD tasks with simple, specific properties. Although chemical foundation models with transfer and in-context learning offer a promising solution for limited training data scenarios, we find that current foundation models do not show strong OOD extrapolation capabilities. We perform extensive ablation experiments to highlight how OOD performance is impacted by data generation, pre-training, hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and molecular representation. We propose that developing ML models with strong OOD generalization is a new frontier challenge in chemical ML model development. This open-source benchmark will be made available on Github.

Abstract: Classical robot navigation often relies on hardcoded state machines and purely geometric path planners, limiting a robot's ability to interpret high-level semantic instructions. In this paper, we first assess GPT-4's ability to act as a path planner compared to the A* algorithm, then present a hybrid planning framework that integrates GPT-4's semantic reasoning with A* on a low-cost robot platform operating on ROS2 Humble. Our approach eliminates explicit finite state machine (FSM) coding by using prompt-based GPT-4 reasoning to handle task logic while maintaining the accurate paths computed by A*. The GPT-4 module provides semantic understanding of instructions and environmental cues (e.g., recognizing toxic obstacles or crowded areas to avoid, or understanding low-battery situations requiring alternate route selection), and dynamically adjusts the robot's occupancy grid via obstacle buffering to enforce semantic constraints. We demonstrate multi-step reasoning for sequential tasks, such as first navigating to a resource goal and then reaching a final destination safely. Experiments on a Petoi Bittle robot with an overhead camera and Raspberry Pi Zero 2W compare classical A* against GPT-4-assisted planning. Results show that while A* is faster and more accurate for basic route generation and obstacle avoidance, the GPT-4-integrated system achieves high success rates (96-100%) on semantic tasks that are infeasible for pure geometric planners. This work highlights how affordable robots can exhibit intelligent, context-aware behaviors by leveraging large language model reasoning with minimal hardware and no fine-tuning.

Abstract: Behind a set of rules in Deontic Defeasible Logic, there is a mapping process of normative background fragments. This process goes from text to rules and implicitly encompasses an explanation of the coded fragments.
  In this paper we deliver a methodology for \textit{legal coding} that starts with a fragment and goes onto a set of Deontic Defeasible Logic rules, involving a set of \textit{scenarios} to test the correctness of the coded fragments. The methodology is illustrated by the coding process of an example text. We then show the results of a series of experiments conducted with humans encoding a variety of normative backgrounds and corresponding cases in which we have measured the efforts made in the coding process, as related to some measurable features. To process these examples, a recently developed technology, Houdini, that allows reasoning in Deontic Defeasible Logic, has been employed.
  Finally we provide a technique to forecast time required in coding, that depends on factors such as knowledge of the legal domain, knowledge of the coding processes, length of the text, and a measure of \textit{depth} that refers to the length of the paths of legal references.

Abstract: Water temperature can vary substantially even across short distances within the same sub-watershed. Accurate prediction of stream water temperature at fine spatial resolutions (i.e., fine scales, $\leq$ 1 km) enables precise interventions to maintain water quality and protect aquatic habitats. Although spatiotemporal models have made substantial progress in spatially coarse time series modeling, challenges persist in predicting at fine spatial scales due to the lack of data at that scale.To address the problem of insufficient fine-scale data, we propose a Multi-Scale Graph Learning (MSGL) method. This method employs a multi-task learning framework where coarse-scale graph learning, bolstered by larger datasets, simultaneously enhances fine-scale graph learning. Although existing multi-scale or multi-resolution methods integrate data from different spatial scales, they often overlook the spatial correspondences across graph structures at various scales. To address this, our MSGL introduces an additional learning task, cross-scale interpolation learning, which leverages the hydrological connectedness of stream locations across coarse- and fine-scale graphs to establish cross-scale connections, thereby enhancing overall model performance. Furthermore, we have broken free from the mindset that multi-scale learning is limited to synchronous training by proposing an Asynchronous Multi-Scale Graph Learning method (ASYNC-MSGL). Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method for anti-sparse downscaling of daily stream temperatures in the Delaware River Basin, USA, highlighting its potential utility for water resources monitoring and management.

Abstract: The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates strong instance segmentation performance across various downstream tasks. However, SAM is trained solely on RGB data, limiting its direct applicability to RGB-thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation. Given that RGB-T provides a robust solution for scene understanding in adverse weather and lighting conditions, such as low light and overexposure, we propose a novel framework, SARTM, which customizes the powerful SAM for RGB-T semantic segmentation. Our key idea is to unleash the potential of SAM while introduce semantic understanding modules for RGB-T data pairs. Specifically, our framework first involves fine tuning the original SAM by adding extra LoRA layers, aiming at preserving SAM's strong generalization and segmentation capabilities for downstream tasks. Secondly, we introduce language information as guidance for training our SARTM. To address cross-modal inconsistencies, we introduce a Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation(CMKD) module that effectively achieves modality adaptation while maintaining its generalization capabilities. This semantic module enables the minimization of modality gaps and alleviates semantic ambiguity, facilitating the combination of any modality under any visual conditions. Furthermore, we enhance the segmentation performance by adjusting the segmentation head of SAM and incorporating an auxiliary semantic segmentation head, which integrates multi-scale features for effective fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted across three multi-modal RGBT semantic segmentation benchmarks: MFNET, PST900, and FMB. Both quantitative and qualitative results consistently demonstrate that the proposed SARTM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across a variety of conditions.

Traditional vision-based approaches like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Visual Odometry (VO) involve complex sensor fusion and high computational demand, whereas range-free methods like DV-HOP face accuracy and stability challenges in sparse, dynamic networks. This paper proposes LanBLoc-BMM, a navigation approach using landmark-based localization (LanBLoc) combined with a battlefield-specific motion model (BMM) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Its performance is benchmarked against three state-of-the-art visual localization algorithms integrated with BMM and Bayesian filters, evaluated on synthetic and real-imitated trajectory datasets using metrics including Average Displacement Error (ADE), Final Displacement Error (FDE), and a newly introduced Average Weighted Risk Score (AWRS). LanBLoc-BMM (with EKF) demonstrates superior performance in ADE, FDE, and AWRS on real-imitated datasets. Additionally, two safe navigation methods, SafeNav-CHull and SafeNav-Centroid, are introduced by integrating LanBLoc-BMM(EKF) with a novel Risk-Aware RRT* (RAw-RRT*) algorithm for obstacle avoidance and risk exposure minimization. Simulation results in battlefield scenarios indicate SafeNav-Centroid excels in accuracy, risk exposure, and trajectory efficiency, while SafeNav-CHull provides superior computational speed.

Abstract: Modular self-reconfigurable satellites refer to satellite clusters composed of individual modular units capable of altering their configurations. The configuration changes enable the execution of diverse tasks and mission objectives. Existing path planning algorithms for reconfiguration often suffer from high computational complexity, poor generalization capability, and limited support for diverse target configurations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a goal-oriented reinforcement learning-based path planning algorithm. This algorithm is the first to address the challenge that previous reinforcement learning methods failed to overcome, namely handling multiple target configurations. Moreover, techniques such as Hindsight Experience Replay and Invalid Action Masking are incorporated to overcome the significant obstacles posed by sparse rewards and invalid actions. Based on these designs, our model achieves a 95% and 73% success rate in reaching arbitrary target configurations in a modular satellite cluster composed of four and six units, respectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to daily life, widely adopted in communication, decision-making, and information retrieval, raising critical questions about how these systems implicitly form and express socio-cognitive attitudes or "worldviews". While existing research extensively addresses demographic and ethical biases, broader dimensions-such as attitudes toward authority, equality, autonomy, and fate-remain under-explored. In this paper, we introduce the Social Worldview Taxonomy (SWT), a structured framework grounded in Cultural Theory, operationalizing four canonical worldviews (Hierarchy, Egalitarianism, Individualism, Fatalism) into measurable sub-dimensions. Using SWT, we empirically identify distinct and interpretable cognitive profiles across 28 diverse LLMs. Further, inspired by Social Referencing Theory, we experimentally demonstrate that explicit social cues systematically shape these cognitive attitudes, revealing both general response patterns and nuanced model-specific variations. Our findings enhance the interpretability of LLMs by revealing implicit socio-cognitive biases and their responsiveness to social feedback, thus guiding the development of more transparent and socially responsible language technologies.

<title>Restoring Calibration for Aligned Large Language Models: A Calibration-Aware Fine-Tuning Approach</title>

Abstract: One of the key technologies for the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) is preference alignment. However, a notable side effect of preference alignment is poor calibration: while the pre-trained models are typically well-calibrated, LLMs tend to become poorly calibrated after alignment with human preferences. In this paper, we investigate why preference alignment affects calibration and how to address this issue. For the first question, we observe that the preference collapse issue in alignment undesirably generalizes to the calibration scenario, causing LLMs to exhibit overconfidence and poor calibration. To address this, we demonstrate the importance of fine-tuning with domain-specific knowledge to alleviate the overconfidence issue. To further analyze whether this affects the model's performance, we categorize models into two regimes: calibratable and non-calibratable, defined by bounds of Expected Calibration Error (ECE). In the calibratable regime, we propose a calibration-aware fine-tuning approach to achieve proper calibration without compromising LLMs' performance. However, as models are further fine-tuned for better performance, they enter the non-calibratable regime. For this case, we develop an EM-algorithm-based ECE regularization for the fine-tuning loss to maintain low calibration error. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

<title>A Synergistic Framework of Nonlinear Acoustic Computing and Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Human-Robot Interaction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01998</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.01998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework integrating nonlinear acoustic computing and reinforcement learning to enhance advanced human-robot interaction under complex noise and reverberation. Leveraging physically informed wave equations (e.g., Westervelt, KZK), the approach captures higher-order phenomena such as harmonic generation and shock formation. By embedding these models in a reinforcement learning-driven control loop, the system adaptively optimizes key parameters (e.g., absorption, beamforming) to mitigate multipath interference and non-stationary noise. Experimental evaluations-covering far-field localization, weak signal detection, and multilingual speech recognition-demonstrate that this hybrid strategy surpasses traditional linear methods and purely data-driven baselines, achieving superior noise suppression, minimal latency, and robust accuracy in demanding real-world scenarios. The proposed system demonstrates broad application prospects in AI hardware, robot, machine audition, artificial audition, and brain-machine interfaces.

Abstract: Multivariate long-term time series forecasting is critical for applications such as weather prediction, and traffic analysis. In addition, the implementation of Transformer variants has improved prediction accuracy. Following these variants, different input data process approaches also enhanced the field, such as tokenization techniques including point-wise, channel-wise, and patch-wise tokenization. However, previous studies still have limitations in time complexity, computational resources, and cross-dimensional interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel CNN Autoencoder-based Score Attention mechanism (CASA), which can be introduced in diverse Transformers model-agnosticically by reducing memory and leading to improvement in model performance. Experiments on eight real-world datasets validate that CASA decreases computational resources by up to 77.7%, accelerates inference by 44.0%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 87.5% of evaluated metrics.

Abstract: Wide & Deep, a simple yet effective learning architecture for recommendation systems developed by Google, has had a significant impact in both academia and industry due to its combination of the memorization ability of generalized linear models and the generalization ability of deep models. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) remain dominant in node classification tasks; however, recent studies have highlighted issues such as heterophily and expressiveness, which focus on graph structure while seemingly neglecting the potential role of node features. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework GCNIII, which leverages the Wide & Deep architecture and incorporates three techniques: Intersect memory, Initial residual and Identity mapping. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that GCNIII can more effectively balance the trade-off between over-fitting and over-generalization on various semi- and full- supervised tasks. Additionally, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for node feature engineering to enhance the performance of GCNIII in cross-domain node classification tasks. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/CYCUCAS/GCNIII.

<title>GraphPrompter: Multi-stage Adaptive Prompt Optimization for Graph In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: Graph In-Context Learning, with the ability to adapt pre-trained graph models to novel and diverse downstream graphs without updating any parameters, has gained much attention in the community. The key to graph in-context learning is to perform downstream graphs conditioned on chosen prompt examples. Existing methods randomly select subgraphs or edges as prompts, leading to noisy graph prompts and inferior model performance. Additionally, due to the gap between pre-training and testing graphs, when the number of classes in the testing graphs is much greater than that in the training, the in-context learning ability will also significantly deteriorate. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we develop a multi-stage adaptive prompt optimization method GraphPrompter, which optimizes the entire process of generating, selecting, and using graph prompts for better in-context learning capabilities. Firstly, Prompt Generator introduces a reconstruction layer to highlight the most informative edges and reduce irrelevant noise for graph prompt construction. Furthermore, in the selection stage, Prompt Selector employs the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and pre-trained selection layers to dynamically choose appropriate samples and minimize the influence of irrelevant prompts. Finally, we leverage a Prompt Augmenter with a cache replacement strategy to enhance the generalization capability of the pre-trained model on new datasets. Extensive experiments show that GraphPrompter effectively enhances the in-context learning ability of graph models. On average across all the settings, our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines by over 8%. Our code is released at https://github.com/karin0018/GraphPrompter.

Abstract: The acquisition of information-rich images within a limited time budget is crucial in medical imaging. Medical image translation (MIT) can help enhance and supplement existing datasets by generating synthetic images from acquired data. While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural image generation, their benefits - creativity and image realism - do not necessarily transfer to medical applications where highly accurate anatomical information is required. In fact, the imitation of acquisition noise or content hallucination hinder clinical utility. Here, we introduce YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a novel 2.5D diffusion-based framework for volumetric MIT. YODA unites diffusion and regression paradigms to produce realistic or noise-free outputs. Furthermore, we propose Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) DM sampling, which draws inspiration from MRI signal averaging. ExpA-sampling suppresses generated noise and, thus, eliminates noise from biasing the evaluation of image quality. Through extensive experiments on four diverse multi-modal datasets - comprising multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we show that diffusion and regression sampling yield similar results in practice. As such, the computational overhead of diffusion sampling does not provide systematic benefits in medical information translation. Building on these insights, we demonstrate that YODA outperforms several state-of-the-art GAN and DM methods. Notably, YODA-generated images are shown to be interchangeable with, or even superior to, physical acquisitions for several downstream tasks. Our findings challenge the presumed advantages of DMs in MIT and pave the way for the practical application of MIT in medical imaging.

Abstract: The notion of language modeling has gradually shifted in recent years from a distribution over finite-length strings to general-purpose prediction models for textual inputs and outputs, following appropriate alignment phases. This paper analyzes the distinction between distribution estimation and response prediction in the context of LLMs, and their often conflicting goals. We examine the training phases of LLMs, which include pretraining, in-context learning, and preference tuning, and also the common use cases for their output probabilities, which include completion probabilities and explicit probabilities as output. We argue that the different settings lead to three distinct intended output distributions. We demonstrate that NLP works often assume that these distributions should be similar, which leads to misinterpretations of their experimental findings. Our work sets firmer formal foundations for the interpretation of LLMs, which will inform ongoing work on the interpretation and use of LLMs' induced distributions.

Abstract: As time series classification (TSC) gains prominence, ensuring robust TSC models against adversarial attacks is crucial. While adversarial defense is well-studied in Computer Vision (CV), the TSC field has primarily relied on adversarial training (AT), which is computationally expensive. In this paper, five data augmentation-based defense methods tailored for time series are developed, with the most computationally intensive method among them increasing the computational resources by only 14.07% compared to the original TSC model. Moreover, the deployment process for these methods is straightforward. By leveraging these advantages of our methods, we create two combined methods. One of these methods is an ensemble of all the proposed techniques, which not only provides better defense performance than PGD-based AT but also enhances the generalization ability of TSC models. Moreover, the computational resources required for our ensemble are less than one-third of those required for PGD-based AT. These methods advance robust TSC in data mining. Furthermore, as foundation models are increasingly explored for time series feature learning, our work provides insights into integrating data augmentation-based adversarial defense with large-scale pre-trained models in future research.

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) are large-scale, pre-trained models that serve as general-purpose backbones for various computer vision tasks. As VFMs' popularity grows, there is an increasing interest in understanding their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks. However, VFMs typically produce low-resolution features, limiting their direct applicability in this context. One way to tackle this limitation is by employing a task-agnostic feature upsampling module that refines VFM features resolution. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we investigate Interactive Segmentation (IS) as a novel benchmark for evaluating feature upsampling methods on VFMs. Due to its inherent multimodal input, consisting of an image and a set of user-defined clicks, as well as its dense mask output, IS creates a challenging environment that demands comprehensive visual scene understanding. Our benchmarking experiments show that selecting appropriate upsampling strategies significantly improves VFM features quality. The code is released at https://github.com/havrylovv/iSegProbe

Abstract: Decentralized AI agents will soon interact across internet platforms, creating security challenges beyond traditional cybersecurity and AI safety frameworks. Free-form protocols are essential for AI's task generalization but enable new threats like secret collusion and coordinated swarm attacks. Network effects can rapidly spread privacy breaches, disinformation, jailbreaks, and data poisoning, while multi-agent dispersion and stealth optimization help adversaries evade oversightcreating novel persistent threats at a systemic level. Despite their critical importance, these security challenges remain understudied, with research fragmented across disparate fields including AI security, multi-agent learning, complex systems, cybersecurity, game theory, distributed systems, and technical AI governance. We introduce \textbf{multi-agent security}, a new field dedicated to securing networks of decentralized AI agents against threats that emerge or amplify through their interactionswhether direct or indirect via shared environmentswith each other, humans, and institutions, and characterize fundamental security-performance trade-offs. Our preliminary work (1) taxonomizes the threat landscape arising from interacting AI agents, (2) surveys security-performance tradeoffs in decentralized AI systems, and (3) proposes a unified research agenda addressing open challenges in designing secure agent systems and interaction environments. By identifying these gaps, we aim to guide research in this critical area to unlock the socioeconomic potential of large-scale agent deployment on the internet, foster public trust, and mitigate national security risks in critical infrastructure and defense contexts.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of slide-based multimedia instruction is challenging. Existing methods like manual assessment, reference-based metrics, and large language model evaluators face limitations in scalability, context capture, or bias. In this paper, we introduce LecEval, an automated metric grounded in Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, to evaluate multimodal knowledge acquisition in slide-based learning. LecEval assesses effectiveness using four rubrics: Content Relevance (CR), Expressive Clarity (EC), Logical Structure (LS), and Audience Engagement (AE). We curate a large-scale dataset of over 2,000 slides from more than 50 online course videos, annotated with fine-grained human ratings across these rubrics. A model trained on this dataset demonstrates superior accuracy and adaptability compared to existing metrics, bridging the gap between automated and human assessments.

Abstract: Online platforms aggregate extensive user feedback across diverse behaviors, providing a rich source for enhancing user engagement. Traditional recommender systems, however, typically optimize for a single target behavior and represent user preferences with a single vector, limiting their ability to handle multiple important behaviors or optimization objectives. This conventional approach also struggles to capture the full spectrum of user interests, resulting in a narrow item pool during candidate generation. To address these limitations, we present Tricolore, a versatile multi-vector learning framework that uncovers connections between different behavior types for more robust candidate generation. Tricolore's adaptive multi-task structure is also customizable to specific platform needs. To manage the variability in sparsity across behavior types, we incorporate a behavior-wise multi-view fusion module that dynamically enhances learning. Moreover, a popularity-balanced strategy ensures the recommendation list balances accuracy with item popularity, fostering diversity and improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate Tricolore's effectiveness across various recommendation scenarios, from short video platforms to e-commerce. By leveraging a shared base embedding strategy, Tricolore also significantly improves the performance for cold-start users. The source code is publicly available at: https://github.com/abnering/Tricolore.

Abstract: Organizing resources in a multidimensional classification space is an approach to efficiently managing and querying large-scale resources. This paper defines an aggregation query on subspace defined by a range on the partial order on coordinate tree at each dimension, where each point contains resources aggregated along the paths of partial order relations on the points so that aggregated resources at each point within the subspace can be measured, ranked and selected. To efficiently locate non-empty points in a large subspace, an approach to generating graph index is proposed to build inclusion links with partial order relations on coordinates of dimensions to enable a subspace query to reach non-empty points by following indexing links and aggregate resources along indexing paths back to their super points. Generating such an index is costly as the number of children of an index node can be very large so that the total number of indexing nodes is unbounded. The proposed approach adopts the following strategies to reduce the cost: (1) adding intersection links between two indexing nodes, which can better reduce query processing costs while controlling the number of nodes of the graph index; (2) intersection links are added between two nodes according to the probabilistic distribution calculated for estimating the costs of adding intersection between two nodes; (3) coordinates at one dimension having more resources are split by coordinates at another dimension to balance the number of resources hold by indexing nodes; and, (4) short-cut links are added between sibling coordinates of coordinate trees to make an efficient query on linear order coordinates. Analysis and experiments verified the effectiveness of the generated index in supporting subspace aggregation query. This work makes significant contributions to the development of data model based on multi-dimensional classification.

Abstract: The Limit Order Book (LOB), the mostly fundamental data of the financial market, provides a fine-grained view of market dynamics while poses significant challenges in dealing with the esteemed deep models due to its strong autocorrelation, cross-feature constrains, and feature scale disparity. Existing approaches often tightly couple representation learning with specific downstream tasks in an end-to-end manner, failed to analyze the learned representations individually and explicitly, limiting their reusability and generalization. This paper conducts the first systematic comparative study of LOB representation learning, aiming to identify the effective way of extracting transferable, compact features that capture essential LOB properties. We introduce LOBench, a standardized benchmark with real China A-share market data, offering curated datasets, unified preprocessing, consistent evaluation metrics, and strong baselines. Extensive experiments validate the sufficiency and necessity of LOB representations for various downstream tasks and highlight their advantages over both the traditional task-specific end-to-end models and the advanced representation learning models for general time series. Our work establishes a reproducible framework and provides clear guidelines for future research. Datasets and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/financial-simulation-lab/LOBench.

Abstract: This reproducibility study analyzes and extends the paper "Axiomatic Causal Interventions for Reverse Engineering Relevance Computation in Neural Retrieval Models," which investigates how neural retrieval models encode task-relevant properties such as term frequency. We reproduce key experiments from the original paper, confirming that information on query terms is captured in the model encoding. We extend this work by applying activation patching to Spanish and Chinese datasets and by exploring whether document-length information is encoded in the model as well. Our results confirm that the designed activation patching method can isolate the behavior to specific components and tokens in neural retrieval models. Moreover, our findings indicate that the location of term frequency generalizes across languages and that in later layers, the information for sequence-level tasks is represented in the CLS token. The results highlight the need for further research into interpretability in information retrieval and reproducibility in machine learning research.

Abstract: Effective social intelligence simulation requires language agents to dynamically adjust reasoning depth, a capability notably absent in current approaches. While existing methods either lack this kind of reasoning capability or enforce uniform long chain-of-thought reasoning across all scenarios, resulting in excessive token usage and inappropriate social simulation. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{AML}$) that strategically selects from four thinking modes (intuitive reaction $\rightarrow$ deep contemplation) based on real-time context. Our framework's core innovation, the $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{AMPO}$) algorithm, introduces three key advancements over existing methods: (1) Multi-granular thinking mode design, (2) Context-aware mode switching across social interaction, and (3) Token-efficient reasoning via depth-adaptive processing. Extensive experiments on social intelligence tasks confirm that AML achieves 15.6% higher task performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our method outperforms GRPO by 7.0% with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains. These results demonstrate that context-sensitive thinking mode selection, as implemented in AMPO, enables more human-like adaptive reasoning than GRPO's fixed-depth approach

Abstract: This paper examines the generalisation of the Pickup and Delivery Problem that allows mid-route load exchanges among vehicles and obeys strict time-windows at all locations. We propose a novel Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) that improves optimality gaps for all benchmarks in the literature and scales up to handle larger ones. To tackle even larger instances, we introduce a refined Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm that improves the adaptability of LNS beyond case-specific configurations appearing in related literature.
  To bridge the gap in benchmark availability, we develop an instance generator that allows for extensive experimentation. For moderate datasets (25 and 50 requests), we evaluate the performance of both LBBD and LNS, the former being able to close the gap and the latter capable of providing near-optimal solutions. For larger instances (75 and 100 requests), we recreate indicative state-of-the-art metaheuristics to highlight the improvements introduced by our LNS refinements, while establishing its scalability.

Abstract: Fantasy football is a billion-dollar industry with millions of participants. Constrained by a fixed budget, decision-makers draft a squad whose players are expected to perform well in the upcoming weeks to maximize total points. This paper proposes novel deterministic and robust integer programming models that select the optimal starting eleven and the captain. A new hybrid scoring metric is constructed using an interpretable artificial intelligence framework and underlying match performance data. Several objective functions and estimation techniques are introduced for the programming model. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to approach fantasy football through this lens. The models' performance is evaluated using data from the 2023/24 Premier League season. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid method achieved the highest score while maintaining consistent performance. Utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation, the strategic choice of averaging techniques for estimating cost vectors, and the proposed hybrid approach are shown to be effective during the out-of-sample period. This paper also provides a thorough analysis of the optimal formations and players selected by the models, offering valuable insights into effective fantasy football strategies.

Abstract: Document chunking fundamentally impacts Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by determining how source materials are segmented before indexing. Despite evidence that Large Language Models (LLMs) are sensitive to the layout and structure of retrieved data, there is currently no framework to analyze the impact of different chunking methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology that defines essential characteristics of the chunking process at three levels: intrinsic passage properties, extrinsic passage properties, and passages-document coherence. We propose HOPE (Holistic Passage Evaluation), a domain-agnostic, automatic evaluation metric that quantifies and aggregates these characteristics. Our empirical evaluations across seven domains demonstrate that the HOPE metric correlates significantly (p > 0.13) with various RAG performance indicators, revealing contrasts between the importance of extrinsic and intrinsic properties of passages. Semantic independence between passages proves essential for system performance with a performance gain of up to 56.2% in factual correctness and 21.1% in answer correctness. On the contrary, traditional assumptions about maintaining concept unity within passages show minimal impact. These findings provide actionable insights for optimizing chunking strategies, thus improving RAG system design to produce more factually correct responses.

<title>DualReal: Adaptive Joint Training for Lossless Identity-Motion Fusion in Video Customization</title>

Abstract: Customized text-to-video generation with pre-trained large-scale models has recently garnered significant attention through focusing on identity and motion consistency. Existing works typically follow the isolated customized paradigm, where the subject identity or motion dynamics are customized exclusively. However, this paradigm completely ignores the intrinsic mutual constraints and synergistic interdependencies between identity and motion, resulting in identity-motion conflicts throughout the generation process that systematically degrades. To address this, we introduce DualReal, a novel framework that, employs adaptive joint training to collaboratively construct interdependencies between dimensions. Specifically, DualReal is composed of two units: (1) Dual-aware Adaptation dynamically selects a training phase (i.e., identity or motion), learns the current information guided by the frozen dimension prior, and employs a regularization strategy to avoid knowledge leakage; (2) StageBlender Controller leverages the denoising stages and Diffusion Transformer depths to guide different dimensions with adaptive granularity, avoiding conflicts at various stages and ultimately achieving lossless fusion of identity and motion patterns. We constructed a more comprehensive benchmark than existing methods. The experimental results show that DualReal improves CLIP-I and DINO-I metrics by 21.7% and 31.8% on average, and achieves top performance on nearly all motion quality metrics.

Abstract: The use of chatbots equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) in educational settings has increased in recent years, showing potential to support teaching and learning. However, the adoption of these technologies has raised concerns about their impact on academic integrity, students' ability to problem-solve independently, and potential underlying biases. To better understand students' perspectives and experiences with these tools, a survey was conducted at a large public university in the United States. Through thematic analysis, 262 undergraduate students' responses regarding their perceived benefits and risks of AI chatbots in education were identified and categorized into themes.
  The results discuss several benefits identified by the students, with feedback and study support, instruction capabilities, and access to information being the most cited. Their primary concerns included risks to academic integrity, accuracy of information, loss of critical thinking skills, the potential development of overreliance, and ethical considerations such as data privacy, system bias, environmental impact, and preservation of human elements in education.
  While student perceptions align with previously discussed benefits and risks of AI in education, they show heightened concerns about distinguishing between human and AI generated work - particularly in cases where authentic work is flagged as AI-generated. To address students' concerns, institutions can establish clear policies regarding AI use and develop curriculum around AI literacy. With these in place, practitioners can effectively develop and implement educational systems that leverage AI's potential in areas such as immediate feedback and personalized learning support. This approach can enhance the quality of students' educational experiences while preserving the integrity of the learning process with AI.

<title>DNAZEN: Enhanced Gene Sequence Representations via Mixed Granularities of Coding Units</title>

Abstract: Genome modeling conventionally treats gene sequence as a language, reflecting its structured motifs and long-range dependencies analogous to linguistic units and organization principles such as words and syntax. Recent studies utilize advanced neural networks, ranging from convolutional and recurrent models to Transformer-based models, to capture contextual information of gene sequence, with the primary goal of obtaining effective gene sequence representations and thus enhance the models' understanding of various running gene samples. However, these approaches often directly apply language modeling techniques to gene sequences and do not fully consider the intrinsic information organization in them, where they do not consider how units at different granularities contribute to representation. In this paper, we propose DNAZEN, an enhanced genomic representation framework designed to learn from various granularities in gene sequences, including small polymers and G-grams that are combinations of several contiguous polymers. Specifically, we extract the G-grams from large-scale genomic corpora through an unsupervised approach to construct the G-gram vocabulary, which is used to provide G-grams in the learning process of DNA sequences through dynamically matching from running gene samples. A Transformer-based G-gram encoder is also proposed and the matched G-grams are fed into it to compute their representations and integrated into the encoder for basic unit (E4BU), which is responsible for encoding small units and maintaining the learning and inference process. To further enhance the learning process, we propose whole G-gram masking to train DNAZEN, where the model largely favors the selection of each entire G-gram to mask rather than an ordinary masking mechanism performed on basic units. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DNAZEN on various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) has achieved remarkable success across various domains, including robotics, autonomous driving, and healthcare, by enabling agents to learn complex behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, existing IL methods often face instability challenges, particularly when relying on adversarial reward or value formulations in world model frameworks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to online imitation learning that addresses these limitations through a reward model based on random network distillation (RND) for density estimation. Our reward model is built on the joint estimation of expert and behavioral distributions within the latent space of the world model. We evaluate our method across diverse benchmarks, including DMControl, Meta-World, and ManiSkill2, showcasing its ability to deliver stable performance and achieve expert-level results in both locomotion and manipulation tasks. Our approach demonstrates improved stability over adversarial methods while maintaining expert-level performance.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is revolutionizing education and workforce development, profoundly shaping how students learn, engage, and prepare for their future. Outpacing the development of uniform policies and structures, GenAI has heralded a unique era and given rise to the GenAI Generation: a cohort of students whose education has been increasingly shaped by the opportunities and challenges GenAI presents during its widespread adoption within society. This study examines our students' perceptions of GenAI through a concise survey with optional open-ended questions, focusing on their awareness, preparedness, and concerns. Evaluation of more than 250 responses with more than 40% providing detailed qualitative feedback reveals a core dual sentiment: while most students express enthusiasm for GenAI, an even greater proportion voice a spectrum of concerns about ethics, job displacement, and the adequacy of educational structures given the highly transformative technology. These findings offer critical insights into how students view the potential and pitfalls of GenAI for future career impacts, with accompanying recommendations to guide educational institutions in navigating a future driven by GenAI.

Abstract: Building models responsive to input prompts represents a transformative shift in machine learning. This paradigm holds significant potential for robotics problems, such as targeted manipulation amidst clutter. In this work, we present a novel approach to combine promptable foundation models with reinforcement learning (RL), enabling robots to perform dexterous manipulation tasks in a prompt-responsive manner. Existing methods struggle to link high-level commands with fine-grained dexterous control. We address this gap with a memory-augmented student-teacher learning framework. We use the Segment-Anything 2 (SAM 2) model as a perception backbone to infer an object of interest from user prompts. While detections are imperfect, their temporal sequence provides rich information for implicit state estimation by memory-augmented models. Our approach successfully learns prompt-responsive policies, demonstrated in picking objects from cluttered scenes. Videos and code are available at https://memory-student-teacher.github.io

Abstract: Evaluating text summarization quality remains a critical challenge in Natural Language Processing. Current approaches face a trade-off between performance and interpretability. We present SEval-Ex, a framework that bridges this gap by decomposing summarization evaluation into atomic statements, enabling both high performance and explainability. SEval-Ex employs a two-stage pipeline: first extracting atomic statements from text source and summary using LLM, then a matching between generated statements. Unlike existing approaches that provide only summary-level scores, our method generates detailed evidence for its decisions through statement-level alignments. Experiments on the SummEval benchmark demonstrate that SEval-Ex achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.580 correlation on consistency with human consistency judgments, surpassing GPT-4 based evaluators (0.521) while maintaining interpretability. Finally, our framework shows robustness against hallucination.

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models struggle to accurately represent object states (e.g., "a table without a bottle," "an empty tumbler"). In this work, we first design a fully-automatic pipeline to generate high-quality synthetic data that accurately captures objects in varied states. Next, we fine-tune several open-source text-to-image models on this synthetic data. We evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models by quantifying the alignment of the generated images to their prompts using GPT4o-mini, and achieve an average absolute improvement of 8+% across four models on the public GenAI-Bench dataset. We also curate a collection of 200 prompts with a specific focus on common objects in various physical states. We demonstrate a significant improvement of an average of 24+% over the baseline on this dataset. We release all evaluation prompts and code.

Abstract: 3D Geometric Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as transformative tools for modeling molecular data. Despite their predictive power, these models often suffer from limited interpretability, raising concerns for scientific applications that require reliable and transparent insights. While existing methods have primarily focused on explaining molecular substructures in 2D GNNs, the transition to 3D GNNs introduces unique challenges, such as handling the implicit dense edge structures created by a cut-off radius. To tackle this, we introduce a novel explanation method specifically designed for 3D GNNs, which localizes the explanation to the immediate neighborhood of each node within the 3D space. Each node is assigned an radius of influence, defining the localized region within which message passing captures spatial and structural interactions crucial for the model's predictions. This method leverages the spatial and geometric characteristics inherent in 3D graphs. By constraining the subgraph to a localized radius of influence, the approach not only enhances interpretability but also aligns with the physical and structural dependencies typical of 3D graph applications, such as molecular learning.

Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to enhance the cost-to-quality ratio of image generation with diffusion models. We hypothesize that differences between distilled (e.g. FLUX.1-schnell) and baseline (e.g. FLUX.1-dev) models are consistent and, therefore, learnable within a specialized domain, like portrait generation. We generate a synthetic paired dataset and train a fast image-to-image translation head. Using two sets of low- and high-quality synthetic images, our model is trained to refine the output of a distilled generator (e.g., FLUX.1-schnell) to a level comparable to a baseline model like FLUX.1-dev, which is more computationally intensive. Our results show that the pipeline, which combines a distilled version of a large generative model with our enhancement layer, delivers similar photorealistic portraits to the baseline version with up to an 82% decrease in computational cost compared to FLUX.1-dev. This study demonstrates the potential for improving the efficiency of AI solutions involving large-scale image generation.

Abstract: Embedding layers in transformer-based NLP models typically account for the largest share of model parameters, scaling with vocabulary size but not yielding performance gains proportional to scale. We propose an alternative approach in which token embedding vectors are first generated deterministically, directly from the token IDs using a Fourier expansion of their normalized values, followed by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) that captures higher-order interactions. We train standard transformers and our architecture on natural language inference tasks (SNLI and MNLI), and evaluate zero-shot performance on sentence textual similarity (STS-B). Our results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance using significantly fewer parameters, trains faster, and operates effectively without the need for dropout. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential for scalable, memory-efficient language models and motivates further large-scale experimentation based on our findings.

Abstract: Quadruped robots are currently a widespread platform for robotics research, thanks to powerful Reinforcement Learning controllers and the availability of cheap and robust commercial platforms. However, to broaden the adoption of the technology in the real world, we require robust navigation stacks relying only on low-cost sensors such as depth cameras. This paper presents a first step towards a robust localization, mapping, and navigation system for low-cost quadruped robots. In pursuit of this objective we combine contact-aided kinematic, visual-inertial odometry, and depth-stabilized vision, enhancing stability and accuracy of the system. Our results in simulation and two different real-world quadruped platforms show that our system can generate an accurate 2D map of the environment, robustly localize itself, and navigate autonomously. Furthermore, we present in-depth ablation studies of the important components of the system and their impact on localization accuracy.

Abstract: Scenario-based testing has emerged as a common method for autonomous vehicles (AVs) safety, offering a more efficient alternative to mile-based testing by focusing on high-risk scenarios. However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and traditional software testing methodologies, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (pfs) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we introduce Risk Estimation Fidelity (REF), a novel metric to certify the alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, ensuring simulation-based safety claims are statistically defensible.

Abstract: This study explores the performance of a random Gaussian smoothing zeroth-order (ZO) scheme for minimising quasar-convex (QC) and strongly quasar-convex (SQC) functions in both unconstrained and constrained settings. For the unconstrained problem, we establish the ZO algorithm's convergence to a global minimum along with its complexity when applied to both QC and SQC functions. For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of proximal-quasar-convexity and prove analogous results to the unconstrained case. Specifically, we show the complexity bounds and the convergence of the algorithm to a neighbourhood of a global minimum whose size can be controlled under a variance reduction scheme. Theoretical findings are illustrated through investigating the performance of the algorithm applied to a range of problems in machine learning and optimisation. Specifically, we observe scenarios where the ZO method outperforms gradient descent. We provide a possible explanation for this phenomenon.

Abstract: We establish a continuous-time framework for analyzing Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) via stochastic control and Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). Considering a continuous-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) driven by a square-integrable martingale, we analyze DQN approximation properties. We show that DQNs can approximate the optimal Q-function on compact sets with arbitrary accuracy and high probability, leveraging residual network approximation theorems and large deviation bounds for the state-action process. We then analyze the convergence of a general Q-learning algorithm for training DQNs in this setting, adapting stochastic approximation theorems. Our analysis emphasizes the interplay between DQN layer count, time discretization, and the role of viscosity solutions (primarily for the value function $V^*$) in addressing potential non-smoothness of the optimal Q-function. This work bridges deep reinforcement learning and stochastic control, offering insights into DQNs in continuous-time settings, relevant for applications with physical systems or high-frequency data.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are trained on in-distribution (ID) data but often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs during deployment -- posing serious risks in safety-critical domains. Recent works have focused on designing scoring functions to quantify OOD uncertainty, with score thresholds typically set based solely on ID data to achieve a target true positive rate (TPR), since OOD data is limited before deployment. However, these TPR-based thresholds leave false positive rates (FPR) uncontrolled, often resulting in high FPRs where OOD points are misclassified as ID. Moreover, fixed scoring functions and thresholds lack the adaptivity needed to handle newly observed, evolving OOD inputs, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that \emph{safely updates both scoring functions and thresholds on the fly} based on real-world OOD inputs. Our method maximizes TPR while strictly controlling FPR at all times, even as the system adapts over time. We provide theoretical guarantees for FPR control under stationary conditions and present extensive empirical evaluations on OpenOOD benchmarks to demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods by achieving higher TPRs while maintaining FPR control.

This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of techniques for compressing LLMs to enable efficient inference in resource-constrained environments. We examine three primary approaches: Knowledge Distillation, Model Quantization, and Model Pruning. For each technique, we discuss the underlying principles, present different variants, and provide examples of successful applications. We also briefly discuss complementary techniques such as mixture-of-experts and early-exit strategies. Finally, we highlight promising future directions, aiming to provide a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners seeking to optimize LLMs for edge deployment.

Abstract: The field of AI safety seeks to prevent or reduce the harms caused by AI systems. A simple and appealing account of what is distinctive of AI safety as a field holds that this feature is constitutive: a research project falls within the purview of AI safety just in case it aims to prevent or reduce the harms caused by AI systems. Call this appealingly simple account The Safety Conception of AI safety. Despite its simplicity and appeal, we argue that The Safety Conception is in tension with at least two trends in the ways AI safety researchers and organizations think and talk about AI safety: first, a tendency to characterize the goal of AI safety research in terms of catastrophic risks from future systems; second, the increasingly popular idea that AI safety can be thought of as a branch of safety engineering. Adopting the methodology of conceptual engineering, we argue that these trends are unfortunate: when we consider what concept of AI safety it would be best to have, there are compelling reasons to think that The Safety Conception is the answer. Descriptively, The Safety Conception allows us to see how work on topics that have historically been treated as central to the field of AI safety is continuous with work on topics that have historically been treated as more marginal, like bias, misinformation, and privacy. Normatively, taking The Safety Conception seriously means approaching all efforts to prevent or mitigate harms from AI systems based on their merits rather than drawing arbitrary distinctions between them.

Abstract: The exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has exposed the inefficiency of conventional von Neumann architectures, where frequent data transfers between compute units and memory create significant energy and latency bottlenecks. Analog Computing-in-Memory (ACIM) addresses this challenge by performing multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations directly in the memory arrays, substantially reducing data movement. However, designing robust ACIM accelerators requires accurate modeling of device- and circuit-level non-idealities. In this work, we present NeuroSim V1.5, introducing several key advances: (1) seamless integration with TensorRT's post-training quantization flow enabling support for more neural networks including transformers, (2) a flexible noise injection methodology built on pre-characterized statistical models, making it straightforward to incorporate data from SPICE simulations or silicon measurements, (3) expanded device support including emerging non-volatile capacitive memories, and (4) up to 6.5x faster runtime than NeuroSim V1.4 through optimized behavioral simulation. The combination of these capabilities uniquely enables systematic design space exploration across both accuracy and hardware efficiency metrics. Through multiple case studies, we demonstrate optimization of critical design parameters while maintaining network accuracy. By bridging high-fidelity noise modeling with efficient simulation, NeuroSim V1.5 advances the design and validation of next-generation ACIM accelerators.

Abstract: Discrete time linear dynamical systems, including Markov chains, have found many applications. However, in some problems, there is uncertainty about the time horizon for which the system runs. This creates uncertainty about the cost (or reward) incurred based on the state distribution when the system stops. Given past data samples of how long a system ran, we propose to theoretically analyze a distributional robust cost estimation task in a Wasserstein ambiguity set, instead of learning a probability distribution from a few samples. Towards this, we show an equivalence between a discrete time Markov Chain on a probability simplex and a global asymptotic stable (GAS) discrete time linear dynamical system, allowing us to base our study on a GAS system only. Then, we provide various polynomial time algorithms and hardness results for different cases in our theoretical study, including a fundamental result about Wasserstein distance based polytope.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs have become increasingly popular due to their wide usage in various downstream applications, including information retrieval, chatbot development, language model construction, and many others. Link prediction (LP) is a crucial downstream task for knowledge graphs, as it helps to address the problem of the incompleteness of the knowledge graphs. However, previous research has shown that knowledge graphs, often created in a (semi) automatic manner, are not free from social biases. These biases can have harmful effects on downstream applications, especially by leading to unfair behavior toward minority groups. To understand this issue in detail, we develop a framework -- AuditLP -- deploying fairness metrics to identify biased outcomes in LP, specifically how occupations are classified as either male or female-dominated based on gender as a sensitive attribute. We have experimented with the sensitive attribute of age and observed that occupations are categorized as young-biased, old-biased, and age-neutral. We conduct our experiments on a large number of knowledge triples that belong to 21 different geographies extracted from the open-sourced knowledge graph, Wikidata. Our study shows that the variance in the biased outcomes across geographies neatly mirrors the socio-economic and cultural division of the world, resulting in a transparent partition of the Global North from the Global South.

<title>Catastrophic Overfitting, Entropy Gap and Participation Ratio: A Noiseless $l^p$ Norm Solution for Fast Adversarial Training</title>

Abstract: Adversarial training is a cornerstone of robust deep learning, but fast methods like the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) often suffer from Catastrophic Overfitting (CO), where models become robust to single-step attacks but fail against multi-step variants. While existing solutions rely on noise injection, regularization, or gradient clipping, we propose a novel solution that purely controls the $l^p$ training norm to mitigate CO.
  Our study is motivated by the empirical observation that CO is more prevalent under the $l^{\infty}$ norm than the $l^2$ norm. Leveraging this insight, we develop a framework for generalized $l^p$ attack as a fixed point problem and craft $l^p$-FGSM attacks to understand the transition mechanics from $l^2$ to $l^{\infty}$. This leads to our core insight: CO emerges when highly concentrated gradients where information localizes in few dimensions interact with aggressive norm constraints. By quantifying gradient concentration through Participation Ratio and entropy measures, we develop an adaptive $l^p$-FGSM that automatically tunes the training norm based on gradient information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves strong robustness without requiring additional regularization or noise injection, providing a novel and theoretically-principled pathway to mitigate the CO problem.

Abstract: Email spam detection is a critical task in modern communication systems, essential for maintaining productivity, security, and user experience. Traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches, while effective in static settings, face significant limitations in adapting to evolving spam tactics, addressing class imbalance, and managing data scarcity. These challenges necessitate innovative approaches that reduce dependency on extensive labeled datasets and frequent retraining. This study investigates the effectiveness of Zero-Shot Learning using FLAN-T5, combined with advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as BERT for email spam detection. By employing BERT to preprocess and extract critical information from email content, and FLAN-T5 to classify emails in a Zero-Shot framework, the proposed approach aims to address the limitations of traditional spam detection systems. The integration of FLAN-T5 and BERT enables robust spam detection without relying on extensive labeled datasets or frequent retraining, making it highly adaptable to unseen spam patterns and adversarial environments. This research highlights the potential of leveraging zero-shot learning and NLPs for scalable and efficient spam detection, providing insights into their capability to address the dynamic and challenging nature of spam detection tasks.

<title>JTCSE: Joint Tensor-Modulus Constraints and Cross-Attention for Unsupervised Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Unsupervised contrastive learning has become a hot research topic in natural language processing. Existing works usually aim at constraining the orientation distribution of the representations of positive and negative samples in the high-dimensional semantic space in contrastive learning, but the semantic representation tensor possesses both modulus and orientation features, and the existing works ignore the modulus feature of the representations and cause insufficient contrastive learning. % Therefore, we firstly propose a training objective that aims at modulus constraints on the semantic representation tensor, to strengthen the alignment between the positive samples in contrastive learning. Therefore, we first propose a training objective that is designed to impose modulus constraints on the semantic representation tensor, to strengthen the alignment between positive samples in contrastive learning. Then, the BERT-like model suffers from the phenomenon of sinking attention, leading to a lack of attention to CLS tokens that aggregate semantic information. In response, we propose a cross-attention structure among the twin-tower ensemble models to enhance the model's attention to CLS token and optimize the quality of CLS Pooling. Combining the above two motivations, we propose a new \textbf{J}oint \textbf{T}ensor representation modulus constraint and \textbf{C}ross-attention unsupervised contrastive learning \textbf{S}entence \textbf{E}mbedding representation framework JTCSE, which we evaluate in seven semantic text similarity computation tasks, and the experimental results show that JTCSE's twin-tower ensemble model and single-tower distillation model outperform the other baselines and become the current SOTA. In addition, we have conducted an extensive zero-shot downstream task evaluation, which shows that JTCSE outperforms other baselines overall on more than 130 tasks.

<title>Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering for Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Generalizing well in deep neural networks remains a core challenge, particularly due to their tendency to converge to sharp minima that degrade robustness. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) mitigates this by seeking flatter minima but perturbs parameters using the full gradient, which can include statistically insignificant directions. We propose ZSharp, a simple yet effective extension to SAM that applies layer-wise Z-score normalization followed by percentile-based filtering to retain only statistically significant gradient components. This selective perturbation aligns updates with curvature-sensitive directions, enhancing generalization without requiring architectural changes. ZSharp introduces only one additional hyperparameter, the percentile threshold, and remains fully compatible with existing SAM variants. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that ZSharp consistently outperforms SAM and its variants in test accuracy, particularly on deeper and transformer-based models. These results demonstrate that ZSharp is a principled and lightweight improvement for sharpness-aware optimization.

<title>SuperEdit: Rectifying and Facilitating Supervision for Instruction-Based Image Editing</title>

Abstract: Due to the challenges of manually collecting accurate editing data, existing datasets are typically constructed using various automated methods, leading to noisy supervision signals caused by the mismatch between editing instructions and original-edited image pairs. Recent efforts attempt to improve editing models through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on recognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to resolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by constructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This includes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the original-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to further enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models exhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps, independent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified guide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some challenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified instructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals with positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model training using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision effectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training tasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to provide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and effective solution for instruction-based image editing. Results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches. Compared with previous SOTA SmartEdit, we achieve 9.19% improvements on the Real-Edit benchmark with 30x less training data and 13x smaller model size.

<title>RM-R1: Reward Modeling as Reasoning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, especially through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. However, existing RMs either produce opaque scalar scores or directly generate the prediction of a preferred answer, making them struggle to integrate natural language critiques, thus lacking interpretability. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's interpretability and performance. In this work, we introduce a new class of generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. The training consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. RM-R1 improves LLM rollouts by self-generating reasoning traces or chat-specific rubrics and evaluating candidate responses against them. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance of generative RMs across multiple comprehensive reward model benchmarks, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., Llama3.1-405B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 13.8%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) research requires high-quality, diverse 3D scenes to effectively support skill acquisition, sim-to-real transfer, and generalization. Achieving these quality standards, however, necessitates the precise replication of real-world object diversity. Existing datasets demonstrate that this process heavily relies on artist-driven designs, which demand substantial human effort and present significant scalability challenges. To scalably produce realistic and interactive 3D scenes, we first present MetaScenes, a large-scale, simulatable 3D scene dataset constructed from real-world scans, which includes 15366 objects spanning 831 fine-grained categories. Then, we introduce Scan2Sim, a robust multi-modal alignment model, which enables the automated, high-quality replacement of assets, thereby eliminating the reliance on artist-driven designs for scaling 3D scenes. We further propose two benchmarks to evaluate MetaScenes: a detailed scene synthesis task focused on small item layouts for robotic manipulation and a domain transfer task in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) to validate cross-domain transfer. Results confirm MetaScene's potential to enhance EAI by supporting more generalizable agent learning and sim-to-real applications, introducing new possibilities for EAI research.

Abstract: Recently, there is a high demand for deploying DeepSeek-R1 and V3 locally, possibly because the official service often suffers from being busy and some organizations have data privacy concerns. While single-machine deployment offers infrastructure simplicity, the models' 671B FP8 parameter configuration exceeds the practical memory limits of a standard 8-GPU machine. Quantization is a widely used technique that helps reduce model memory consumption. However, it is unclear what the performance of DeepSeek-R1 and V3 will be after being quantized. This technical report presents the first quantitative evaluation of multi-bitwidth quantization across the complete DeepSeek model spectrum. Key findings reveal that 4-bit quantization maintains little performance degradation versus FP8 while enabling single-machine deployment on standard NVIDIA GPU devices. We further propose DQ3_K_M, a dynamic 3-bit quantization method that significantly outperforms traditional Q3_K_M variant on various benchmarks, which is also comparable with 4-bit quantization (Q4_K_M) approach in most tasks. Moreover, DQ3_K_M supports single-machine deployment configurations for both NVIDIA H100/A100 and Huawei 910B. Our implementation of DQ3\_K\_M is released at https://github.com/UnicomAI/DeepSeek-Eval, containing optimized 3-bit quantized variants of both DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3.

<title>Optimizing Chain-of-Thought Reasoners via Gradient Variance Minimization in Rejection Sampling and RL</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) can be formalized as a latent variable problem, where the model needs to generate intermediate reasoning steps. While prior approaches such as iterative reward-ranked fine-tuning (RAFT) have relied on such formulations, they typically apply uniform inference budgets across prompts, which fails to account for variability in difficulty and convergence behavior. This work identifies the main bottleneck in CoT training as inefficient stochastic gradient estimation due to static sampling strategies. We propose GVM-RAFT, a prompt-specific Dynamic Sample Allocation Strategy designed to minimize stochastic gradient variance under a computational budget constraint. The method dynamically allocates computational resources by monitoring prompt acceptance rates and stochastic gradient norms, ensuring that the resulting gradient variance is minimized. Our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed dynamic sampling strategy leads to accelerated convergence guarantees under suitable conditions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning show that GVM-RAFT achieves a 2-4x speedup and considerable accuracy improvements over vanilla RAFT. The proposed dynamic sampling strategy is general and can be incorporated into other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as GRPO, leading to similar improvements in convergence and test accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/GVM.

Abstract: Pneumonia Diagnosis, though it is crucial for an effective treatment, it can be hampered by uncertainty. This uncertainty starts to arise due to some factors like atypical presentations, limitations of diagnostic tools such as chest X-rays, and the presence of co-existing respiratory conditions. This research proposes one of the supervised learning methods, CNN. Using MobileNetV2 as the pre-trained one with ResNet101V2 architecture and using Keras API as the built from scratch model, for identifying lung diseases especially pneumonia. The datasets used in this research were obtained from the website through Kaggle. The result shows that by implementing CNN MobileNetV2 and CNN from scratch the result is promising. While validating data, MobileNetV2 performs with stability and minimal overfitting, while the training accuracy increased to 84.87% later it slightly decreased to 78.95%, with increasing validation loss from 0.499 to 0.6345. Nonetheless, MobileNetV2 is more stable. Although it takes more time to train each epoch. Meanwhile, after the 10th epoch, the Scratch model displayed more instability and overfitting despite having higher validation accuracy, training accuracy decreased significantly to 78.12% and the validation loss increased from 0.5698 to 1.1809. With these results, ResNet101V2 offers stability, and the Scratch model offers high accuracy.

Abstract: We present Bielik 11B v2, a state-of-the-art language model optimized for Polish text processing. Built on the Mistral 7B v0.2 architecture and scaled to 11B parameters using depth up-scaling, this model demonstrates exceptional performance across Polish language benchmarks while maintaining strong cross-lingual capabilities. We introduce two key technical innovations: Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss, which optimizes learning across diverse instruction types by assigning quality-based weights to training examples, and Adaptive Learning Rate, which dynamically adjusts based on context length. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that Bielik 11B v2 outperforms many larger models, including those with 2-6 times more parameters, and significantly surpasses other specialized Polish language models on tasks ranging from linguistic understanding to complex reasoning. The model's parameter efficiency and extensive quantization options enable deployment across various hardware configurations, advancing Polish language AI capabilities and establishing new benchmarks for resource-efficient language modeling in less-represented languages.

Abstract: Text-to-Time Series generation holds significant potential to address challenges such as data sparsity, imbalance, and limited availability of multimodal time series datasets across domains. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in Text-to-X (e.g., vision and audio data) generation, their use in time series generation remains in its nascent stages. Existing approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the lack of systematic exploration of general-proposed time series captions, which are often domain-specific and struggle with generalization; and (2) the inability to generate time series of arbitrary lengths, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we first categorize time series captions into three levels: point-level, fragment-level, and instance-level. Additionally, we introduce a new fragment-level dataset containing over 600,000 high-resolution time series-text pairs. Second, we propose Text-to-Series (T2S), a diffusion-based framework that bridges the gap between natural language and time series in a domain-agnostic manner. T2S employs a length-adaptive variational autoencoder to encode time series of varying lengths into consistent latent embeddings. On top of that, T2S effectively aligns textual representations with latent embeddings by utilizing Flow Matching and employing Diffusion Transformer as the denoiser. We train T2S in an interleaved paradigm across multiple lengths, allowing it to generate sequences of any desired length. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that T2S achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 datasets spanning 12 domains.

arXiv:2505.02433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose FairPO, a novel framework designed to promote fairness in multi-label classification by directly optimizing preference signals with a group robustness perspective. In our framework, the set of labels is partitioned into privileged and non-privileged groups, and a preference-based loss inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is employed to more effectively differentiate true positive labels from confusing negatives within the privileged group, while preserving baseline classification performance for non-privileged labels. By framing the learning problem as a robust optimization over groups, our approach dynamically adjusts the training emphasis toward groups with poorer performance, thereby mitigating bias and ensuring a fairer treatment across diverse label categories. In addition, we outline plans to extend this approach by investigating alternative loss formulations such as Simple Preference Optimisation (SimPO) and Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) to exploit reference-free reward formulations and contrastive training signals. Furthermore, we plan to extend FairPO with multilabel generation capabilities, enabling the model to dynamically generate diverse and coherent label sets for ambiguous inputs.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations enhance interpretability by identifying alternative inputs that produce different outputs, offering localized insights into model decisions. However, traditional methods often neglect causal relationships, leading to unrealistic examples. While newer approaches integrate causality, they are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient method based on backtracking counterfactuals that incorporates causal reasoning to generate actionable explanations. We first examine the limitations of existing methods and then introduce our novel approach and its features. We also explore the relationship between our method and previous techniques, demonstrating that it generalizes them in specific scenarios. Finally, experiments show that our method provides deeper insights into model outputs.

<title>Timing Is Everything: Finding the Optimal Fusion Points in Multimodal Medical Imaging</title>

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning harnesses diverse imaging modalities, such as MRI sequences, to enhance diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging. A key challenge is determining the optimal timing for integrating these modalities-specifically, identifying the network layers where fusion modules should be inserted. Current approaches often rely on manual tuning or exhaustive search, which are computationally expensive without any guarantee of converging to optimal results. We propose a sequential forward search algorithm that incrementally activates and evaluates candidate fusion modules at different layers of a multimodal network. At each step, the algorithm retrains from previously learned weights and compares validation loss to identify the best-performing configuration. This process systematically reduces the search space, enabling efficient identification of the optimal fusion timing without exhaustively testing all possible module placements. The approach is validated on two multimodal MRI datasets, each addressing different classification tasks. Our algorithm consistently identified configurations that outperformed unimodal baselines, late fusion, and a brute-force ensemble of all potential fusion placements. These architectures demonstrated superior accuracy, F-score, and specificity while maintaining competitive or improved AUC values. Furthermore, the sequential nature of the search significantly reduced computational overhead, making the optimization process more practical. By systematically determining the optimal timing to fuse imaging modalities, our method advances multimodal deep learning for medical imaging. It provides an efficient and robust framework for fusion optimization, paving the way for improved clinical decision-making and more adaptable, scalable architectures in medical AI applications.

Abstract: Enabling a high-degree-of-freedom robot to learn specific skills is a challenging task due to the complexity of robotic dynamics. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising solution; however, addressing such problems requires the design of multiple reward functions to account for various constraints in robotic motion. Existing approaches typically sum all reward components indiscriminately to optimize the RL value function and policy. We argue that this uniform inclusion of all reward components in policy optimization is inefficient and limits the robot's learning performance. To address this, we propose an Automated Hybrid Reward Scheduling (AHRS) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). This paradigm dynamically adjusts the learning intensity of each reward component throughout the policy optimization process, enabling robots to acquire skills in a gradual and structured manner. Specifically, we design a multi-branch value network, where each branch corresponds to a distinct reward component. During policy optimization, each branch is assigned a weight that reflects its importance, and these weights are automatically computed based on rules designed by LLMs. The LLM generates a rule set in advance, derived from the task description, and during training, it selects a weight calculation rule from the library based on language prompts that evaluate the performance of each branch. Experimental results demonstrate that the AHRS method achieves an average 6.48% performance improvement across multiple high-degree-of-freedom robotic tasks.

Abstract: The Bus Driver Scheduling Problem (BDSP) is a combinatorial optimization problem with the goal to design shifts to cover prearranged bus tours. The objective takes into account the operational cost as well as the satisfaction of drivers. This problem is heavily constrained due to strict legal rules and collective agreements. The objective of this article is to provide state-of-the-art exact and hybrid solution methods that can provide high-quality solutions for instances of different sizes. This work presents a comprehensive study of both an exact method, Branch and Price (B&amp;P), as well as a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) framework which uses B&amp;P or Column Generation (CG) for the repair phase to solve the BDSP. It further proposes and evaluates a novel deeper integration of B&amp;P and LNS, storing the generated columns from the LNS subproblems and reusing them for other subproblems, or to find better global solutions. The article presents a detailed analysis of several components of the solution methods and their impact, including general improvements for the B&amp;P subproblem, which is a high-dimensional Resource Constrained Shortest Path Problem (RCSPP), and the components of the LNS. The evaluation shows that our approach provides new state-of-the-art results for instances of all sizes, including exact solutions for small instances, and low gaps to a known lower bound for mid-sized instances. Conclusions: We observe that B&amp;P provides the best results for small instances, while the tight integration of LNS and CG can provide high-quality solutions for larger instances, further improving over LNS which just uses CG as a black box. The proposed methods are general and can also be applied to other rule sets and related optimization problems

<title>SEFE: Superficial and Essential Forgetting Eliminator for Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to enable Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we explore forgetting in this context, categorizing it into superficial forgetting and essential forgetting. Superficial forgetting refers to cases where the model's knowledge may not be genuinely lost, but its responses to previous tasks deviate from expected formats due to the influence of subsequent tasks' answer styles, making the results unusable. By contrast, essential forgetting refers to situations where the model provides correctly formatted but factually inaccurate answers, indicating a true loss of knowledge. Assessing essential forgetting necessitates addressing superficial forgetting first, as severe superficial forgetting can obscure the model's knowledge state. Hence, we first introduce the Answer Style Diversification (ASD) paradigm, which defines a standardized process for transforming data styles across different tasks, unifying their training sets into similarly diversified styles to prevent superficial forgetting caused by style shifts. Building on this, we propose RegLoRA to mitigate essential forgetting. RegLoRA stabilizes key parameters where prior knowledge is primarily stored by applying regularization, enabling the model to retain existing competencies. Experimental results demonstrate that our overall method, SEFE, achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<title>Corr2Distrib: Making Ambiguous Correspondences an Ally to Predict Reliable 6D Pose Distributions</title>

Abstract: We introduce Corr2Distrib, the first correspondence-based method which estimates a 6D camera pose distribution from an RGB image, explaining the observations. Indeed, symmetries and occlusions introduce visual ambiguities, leading to multiple valid poses. While a few recent methods tackle this problem, they do not rely on local correspondences which, according to the BOP Challenge, are currently the most effective way to estimate a single 6DoF pose solution. Using correspondences to estimate a pose distribution is not straightforward, since ambiguous correspondences induced by visual ambiguities drastically decrease the performance of PnP. With Corr2Distrib, we turn these ambiguities into an advantage to recover all valid poses. Corr2Distrib first learns a symmetry-aware representation for each 3D point on the object's surface, characterized by a descriptor and a local frame. This representation enables the generation of 3DoF rotation hypotheses from single 2D-3D correspondences. Next, we refine these hypotheses into a 6DoF pose distribution using PnP and pose scoring. Our experimental evaluations on complex non-synthetic scenes show that Corr2Distrib outperforms state-of-the-art solutions for both pose distribution estimation and single pose estimation from an RGB image, demonstrating the potential of correspondences-based approaches.

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed via open-source and commercial frameworks, enabling individuals and organizations to self-host advanced AI capabilities. However, insecure defaults and misconfigurations often expose LLM services to the public Internet, posing significant security and system engineering risks. Aims: This study aims to unveil the current landscape of public-facing LLM deployments in the wild through a large-scale empirical study, focusing on service prevalence, exposure characteristics, systemic vulnerabilities, and associated risks. Method: We conducted an Internet-wide measurement to identify public-facing LLM deployments across 15 frameworks, discovering 320,102 services. We extracted 158 unique API endpoints, grouped into 12 functional categories based on capabilities and security risks. We further analyzed configurations, authentication practices, and geographic distributions, revealing deployment trends and systemic issues in real-world LLM system engineering. Results: Our study shows that public LLM deployments are rapidly growing but often insecure. Among all endpoints, we observe widespread use of insecure protocols, poor TLS configurations, and unauthenticated access to critical operations. Security risks, including model disclosure, system leakage, and unauthorized access, are pervasive, highlighting the need for secure-by-default frameworks and stronger deployment practices. Conclusions: Public-facing LLM deployments suffer from widespread security and configuration flaws, exposing services to misuse, model theft, resource hijacking, and remote exploitation. Strengthening default security, deployment practices, and operational standards is critical for the growing self-hosted LLM ecosystem.

<title>Large Language Model Partitioning for Low-Latency Inference at the Edge</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02533</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on autoregressive, decoder-only Transformers generate text one token at a time, where a token represents a discrete unit of text. As each newly produced token is appended to the partial output sequence, the length grows and so does the memory and compute load, due to the expanding key-value caches, which store intermediate representations of all previously generated tokens in the multi-head attention (MHA) layer. As this iterative process steadily increases memory and compute demands, layer-based partitioning in resource-constrained edge environments often results in memory overload or high inference latency. To address this and reduce inference latency, we propose a resource-aware Transformer architecture partitioning algorithm, where the partitioning decision is updated at regular intervals during token generation. The approach is myopic in that it is based on instantaneous information about device resource availability and network link bandwidths. When first executed, the algorithm places blocks on devices, and in later executions, it migrates these blocks among devices so that the sum of migration delay and inference delay remains low. Our approach partitions the decoder at the attention head level, co-locating each attention head with its key-value cache and allowing dynamic migrations whenever resources become tight. By allocating different attention heads to different devices, we exploit parallel execution of attention heads and thus achieve substantial reductions in inference delays. Our experiments show that in small-scale settings (3-5 devices), the proposed method achieves within 15 to 20 percent of an exact optimal solver's latency, while in larger-scale tests it achieves notable improvements in inference speed and memory usage compared to state-of-the-art layer-based partitioning approaches.

Abstract: Conventional techniques for imposing monotonicity in MLPs by construction involve the use of non-negative weight constraints and bounded activation functions, which pose well-known optimization challenges. In this work, we generalize previous theoretical results, showing that MLPs with non-negative weight constraint and activations that saturate on alternating sides are universal approximators for monotonic functions. Additionally, we show an equivalence between the saturation side in the activations and the sign of the weight constraint. This connection allows us to prove that MLPs with convex monotone activations and non-positive constrained weights also qualify as universal approximators, in contrast to their non-negative constrained counterparts. Our results provide theoretical grounding to the empirical effectiveness observed in previous works while leading to possible architectural simplification. Moreover, to further alleviate the optimization difficulties, we propose an alternative formulation that allows the network to adjust its activations according to the sign of the weights. This eliminates the requirement for weight reparameterization, easing initialization and improving training stability. Experimental evaluation reinforces the validity of the theoretical results, showing that our novel approach compares favourably to traditional monotonic architectures.

<title>Lazy But Effective: Collaborative Personalized Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02540</link>

Abstract: In Federated Learning, heterogeneity in client data distributions often means that a single global model does not have the best performance for individual clients. Consider for example training a next-word prediction model for keyboards: user-specific language patterns due to demographics (dialect, age, etc.), language proficiency, and writing style result in a highly non-IID dataset across clients. Other examples are medical images taken with different machines, or driving data from different vehicle types. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective personalized federated learning framework (pFedLIA) that utilizes a computationally efficient influence approximation, called `Lazy Influence', to cluster clients in a distributed manner before model aggregation. Within each cluster, data owners collaborate to jointly train a model that captures the specific data patterns of the clients. Our method has been shown to successfully recover the global model's performance drop due to the non-IID-ness in various synthetic and real-world settings, specifically a next-word prediction task on the Nordic languages as well as several benchmark tasks. It matches the performance of a hypothetical Oracle clustering, and significantly improves on existing baselines, e.g., an improvement of 17% on CIFAR100.

Abstract: We introduce Bielik v3, a series of parameter-efficient generative text models (1.5B and 4.5B) optimized for Polish language processing. These models demonstrate that smaller, well-optimized architectures can achieve performance comparable to much larger counterparts while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. Our approach incorporates several key innovations: a custom Polish tokenizer (APT4) that significantly improves token efficiency, Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss to balance learning across instruction types, and Adaptive Learning Rate that dynamically adjusts based on training progress. Trained on a meticulously curated corpus of 292 billion tokens spanning 303 million documents, these models excel across multiple benchmarks, including the Open PL LLM Leaderboard, Complex Polish Text Understanding Benchmark, Polish EQ-Bench, and Polish Medical Leaderboard. The 4.5B parameter model achieves results competitive with models 2-3 times its size, while the 1.5B model delivers strong performance despite its extremely compact profile. These advances establish new benchmarks for parameter-efficient language modeling in less-represented languages, making high-quality Polish language AI more accessible for resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a cornerstone in graph-based data analysis, with applications in diverse domains such as bioinformatics, social networks, and recommendation systems. However, the interplay between model interpretability and robustness remains poorly understood, especially under adversarial scenarios like poisoning and evasion attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark to systematically analyze the impact of various factors on the interpretability of GNNs, including the influence of robustness-enhancing defense mechanisms.
  We evaluate six GNN architectures based on GCN, SAGE, GIN, and GAT across five datasets from two distinct domains, employing four interpretability metrics: Fidelity, Stability, Consistency, and Sparsity. Our study examines how defenses against poisoning and evasion attacks, applied before and during model training, affect interpretability and highlights critical trade-offs between robustness and interpretability. The framework will be published as open source.
  The results reveal significant variations in interpretability depending on the chosen defense methods and model architecture characteristics. By establishing a standardized benchmark, this work provides a foundation for developing GNNs that are both robust to adversarial threats and interpretable, facilitating trust in their deployment in sensitive applications.

Abstract: Federated graph learning is a widely recognized technique that promotes collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client graphs.However, existing approaches heavily rely on the communication of model parameters or gradients for federated optimization and fail to adequately address the data heterogeneity introduced by intricate and diverse graph distributions. Although some methods attempt to share additional messages among the server and clients to improve federated convergence during communication, they introduce significant privacy risks and increase communication overhead. To address these issues, we introduce the concept of a condensed graph as a novel optimization carrier to address FGL data heterogeneity and propose a new FGL paradigm called FedGM. Specifically, we utilize a generalized condensation graph consensus to aggregate comprehensive knowledge from distributed graphs, while minimizing communication costs and privacy risks through a single transmission of the condensed data. Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedGM over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting its potential for a novel FGL paradigm.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language model (LLM) fine-tuning show promise in addressing multi-objective tasks but still face significant challenges, including complex objective balancing, low training efficiency, poor scalability, and limited explainability. Leveraging ensemble learning principles, we introduce an Ensemble Multi-Objective RL (EMORL) framework that fine-tunes multiple models with individual objectives while optimizing their aggregation after the training to improve efficiency and flexibility. Our method is the first to aggregate the last hidden states of individual models, incorporating contextual information from multiple objectives. This approach is supported by a hierarchical grid search algorithm that identifies optimal weighted combinations. We evaluate EMORL on counselor reflection generation tasks, using text-scoring LLMs to evaluate the generations and provide rewards during RL fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on the PAIR and Psych8k datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of EMORL against existing baselines: significantly lower and more stable training consumption ($17,529\pm 1,650$ data points and $6,573\pm 147.43$ seconds), improved scalability and explainability, and comparable performance across multiple objectives.

Abstract: Real-time, intelligent, and natural speech interaction is an essential part of the next-generation human-computer interaction. Recent advancements have showcased the potential of building intelligent spoken chatbots based on large language models (LLMs).

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a crucial property in artificial intelligence, enabling models to handle novel combinations of known components. While most deep learning models lack this capability, certain models succeed in specific tasks, suggesting the existence of governing conditions. This paper derives a necessary and sufficient condition for compositional generalization in neural networks. Conceptually, it requires that (i) the computational graph matches the true compositional structure, and (ii) components encode just enough information in training. The condition is supported by mathematical proofs. This criterion combines aspects of architecture design, regularization, and training data properties. A carefully designed minimal example illustrates an intuitive understanding of the condition. We also discuss the potential of the condition for assessing compositional generalization before training. This work is a fundamental theoretical study of compositional generalization in neural networks.

Abstract: Chemical reaction and retrosynthesis prediction are fundamental tasks in drug discovery. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in many domains. However, directly applying LLMs to these tasks faces two major challenges: (i) lacking a large-scale chemical synthesis-related instruction dataset; (ii) ignoring the close correlation between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction for the existing fine-tuning strategies. To address these challenges, we propose ChemDual, a novel LLM framework for accurate chemical synthesis. Specifically, considering the high cost of data acquisition for reaction and retrosynthesis, ChemDual regards the reaction-and-retrosynthesis of molecules as a related recombination-and-fragmentation process and constructs a large-scale of 4.4 million instruction dataset. Furthermore, ChemDual introduces an enhanced LLaMA, equipped with a multi-scale tokenizer and dual-task learning strategy, to jointly optimize the process of recombination and fragmentation as well as the tasks between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction. Extensive experiments on Mol-Instruction and USPTO-50K datasets demonstrate that ChemDual achieves state-of-the-art performance in both predictions of reaction and retrosynthesis, outperforming the existing conventional single-task approaches and the general open-source LLMs. Through molecular docking analysis, ChemDual generates compounds with diverse and strong protein binding affinity, further highlighting its strong potential in drug design.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) systems increasingly operate in environments where devices must respond in real time while managing fluctuating resource constraints, including energy and bandwidth. Yet, current approaches often fall short in addressing scenarios where operational constraints evolve over time. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Budgeted Multi-Armed Bandit framework tailored for IoT applications with dynamic operational limits. Our model introduces a decaying violation budget, which permits limited constraint violations early in the learning process and gradually enforces stricter compliance over time. We present the Budgeted Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, which adaptively balances performance optimization and compliance with time-varying constraints. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that Budgeted UCB achieves sublinear regret and logarithmic constraint violations over the learning horizon. Extensive simulations in a wireless communication setting show that our approach achieves faster adaptation and better constraint satisfaction than standard online learning methods. These results highlight the framework's potential for building adaptive, resource-aware IoT systems.

Abstract: Gaze may enhance the robustness of lie detectors but remains under-studied. This study evaluated the efficacy of AI models (using fixations, saccades, blinks, and pupil size) for detecting deception in Concealed Information Tests across two datasets. The first, collected with Eyelink 1000, contains gaze data from a computerized experiment where 87 participants revealed, concealed, or faked the value of a previously selected card. The second, collected with Pupil Neon, involved 36 participants performing a similar task but facing an experimenter. XGBoost achieved accuracies up to 74% in a binary classification task (Revealing vs. Concealing) and 49% in a more challenging three-classification task (Revealing vs. Concealing vs. Faking). Feature analysis identified saccade number, duration, amplitude, and maximum pupil size as the most important for deception prediction. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using gaze and AI to enhance lie detectors and encourage future research that may improve on this.

Abstract: The Transformer model has shown strong performance in multivariate time series forecasting by leveraging channel-wise self-attention. However, this approach lacks temporal constraints when computing temporal features and does not utilize cumulative historical series effectively.To address these limitations, we propose the Structured Channel-wise Transformer with Cumulative Historical state (SCFormer). SCFormer introduces temporal constraints to all linear transformations, including the query, key, and value matrices, as well as the fully connected layers within the Transformer. Additionally, SCFormer employs High-order Polynomial Projection Operators (HiPPO) to deal with cumulative historical time series, allowing the model to incorporate information beyond the look-back window during prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that SCFormer significantly outperforms mainstream baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing time series forecasting.

Abstract: Serious illness communication (SIC) in end-of-life care faces challenges such as emotional stress, cultural barriers, and balancing hope with honesty. Despite its importance, one of the few available ways for clinicians to practice SIC is with standardized patients, which is expensive, time-consuming, and inflexible. In this paper, we present SOPHIE, an AI-powered standardized patient simulation and automated feedback system. SOPHIE combines large language models (LLMs), a lifelike virtual avatar, and automated, personalized feedback based on clinical literature to provide remote, on-demand SIC training. In a randomized control study with healthcare students and professionals, SOPHIE users demonstrated significant improvement across three critical SIC domains: Empathize, Be Explicit, and Empower. These results suggest that AI-driven tools can enhance complex interpersonal communication skills, offering scalable, accessible solutions to address a critical gap in clinician education.

Abstract: Cellular reprogramming, the artificial transformation of one cell type into another, has been attracting increasing research attention due to its therapeutic potential for complex diseases. However, discovering reprogramming strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs. In this study, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory networks and signalling pathway networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under the asynchronous update mode in the context of cellular reprogramming. To facilitate scalability, we consider our previously introduced concept of a pseudo-attractor and we improve our procedure for effective identification of pseudo-attractor states. Finally, we devise a computational framework to solve the control problem. To leverage the structure of biological systems, we incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolutions into the artificial neural network approximator for the action-value function learned by the DRL agent. Experiments on a number of large real-world biological networks from literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a prominent solution for Natural Language Processing tasks. Notably, they can approach these problems in a zero or few-shot manner, thereby eliminating the need for training or fine-tuning task-specific models. However, LLMs face some challenges, including hallucination and the presence of outdated knowledge or missing information from specific domains in the training data. These problems cannot be easily solved by retraining the models with new data as it is a time-consuming and expensive process. To mitigate these issues, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been proposed as a structured external source of information to enrich LLMs. With this idea, in this work we use KGs to enhance LLMs for zero-shot Entity Disambiguation (ED). For that purpose, we leverage the hierarchical representation of the entities' classes in a KG to gradually prune the candidate space as well as the entities' descriptions to enrich the input prompt with additional factual knowledge. Our evaluation on popular ED datasets shows that the proposed method outperforms non-enhanced and description-only enhanced LLMs, and has a higher degree of adaptability than task-specific models. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis and discuss the impact of the leveraged KG's semantic expressivity on the ED performance.

Abstract: Legal practice requires careful adherence to procedural rules. In the United States, few are more complex than those found in The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation. Compliance with this system's 500+ pages of byzantine formatting instructions is the raison d'etre of thousands of student law review editors and the bete noire of lawyers everywhere. To evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) are able to adhere to the procedures of such a complicated system, we construct an original dataset of 866 Bluebook tasks and test flagship LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and DeepSeek. We show (1) that these models produce fully compliant Bluebook citations only 69%-74% of the time and (2) that in-context learning on the Bluebook's underlying system of rules raises accuracy only to 77%. These results caution against using off-the-shelf LLMs to automate aspects of the law where fidelity to procedure is paramount.

Abstract: Pathologists rely on gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) to diagnose diseases like cancer, yet current digital pathology tools hinder diagnosis. The immense scale of WSIs, often exceeding 100,000 X 100,000 pixels, clashes with the limited views traditional monitors offer. This mismatch forces constant panning and zooming, increasing pathologist cognitive load, causing diagnostic fatigue, and slowing pathologists' adoption of digital methods. PathVis, our mixed-reality visualization platform for Apple Vision Pro, addresses these challenges. It transforms the pathologist's interaction with data, replacing cumbersome mouse-and-monitor navigation with intuitive exploration using natural hand gestures, eye gaze, and voice commands in an immersive workspace. PathVis integrates AI to enhance diagnosis. An AI-driven search function instantly retrieves and displays the top five similar patient cases side-by-side, improving diagnostic precision and efficiency through rapid comparison. Additionally, a multimodal conversational AI assistant offers real-time image interpretation support and aids collaboration among pathologists across multiple Apple devices. By merging the directness of traditional pathology with advanced mixed-reality visualization and AI, PathVis improves diagnostic workflows, reduces cognitive strain, and makes pathology practice more effective and engaging. The PathVis source code and a demo video are publicly available at: https://github.com/jaiprakash1824/Path_Vis

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs, revolutionizing the natural language processing domain and beyond. Due to immense parameter sizes, fine-tuning these models with private data for diverse downstream tasks has become mainstream. Though federated learning (FL) offers a promising solution for fine-tuning LLMs without sharing raw data, substantial computing costs hinder its democratization. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, private client devices often possess heterogeneous computing resources, further complicating LLM fine-tuning. To combat these challenges, we propose HSplitLoRA, a heterogeneous parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework built on split learning (SL) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, for efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on heterogeneous client devices. HSplitLoRA first identifies important weights based on their contributions to LLM training. It then dynamically configures the decomposition ranks of LoRA adapters for selected weights and determines the model split point according to varying computing budgets of client devices. Finally, a noise-free adapter aggregation mechanism is devised to support heterogeneous adapter aggregation without introducing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HSplitLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in training accuracy and convergence speed.

<title>Towards Dataset Copyright Evasion Attack against Personalized Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have rapidly advanced, enabling high-quality image generation conditioned on textual prompts. However, the growing trend of fine-tuning pre-trained models for personalization raises serious concerns about unauthorized dataset usage. To combat this, dataset ownership verification (DOV) has emerged as a solution, embedding watermarks into the fine-tuning datasets using backdoor techniques. These watermarks remain inactive under benign samples but produce owner-specified outputs when triggered. Despite the promise of DOV for T2I diffusion models, its robustness against copyright evasion attacks (CEA) remains unexplored. In this paper, we explore how attackers can bypass these mechanisms through CEA, allowing models to circumvent watermarks even when trained on watermarked datasets. We propose the first copyright evasion attack (i.e., CEAT2I) specifically designed to undermine DOV in T2I diffusion models. Concretely, our CEAT2I comprises three stages: watermarked sample detection, trigger identification, and efficient watermark mitigation. A key insight driving our approach is that T2I models exhibit faster convergence on watermarked samples during the fine-tuning, evident through intermediate feature deviation. Leveraging this, CEAT2I can reliably detect the watermarked samples. Then, we iteratively ablate tokens from the prompts of detected watermarked samples and monitor shifts in intermediate features to pinpoint the exact trigger tokens. Finally, we adopt a closed-form concept erasure method to remove the injected watermark. Extensive experiments show that our CEAT2I effectively evades DOV mechanisms while preserving model performance.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning reaches a superhuman level of play in many complete information games. The state of the art algorithm for learning with zero knowledge is AlphaZero. We take another approach, Ath\'enan, which uses a different, Minimax-based, search algorithm called Descent, as well as different learning targets and that does not use a policy. We show that for multiple games it is much more efficient than the reimplementation of AlphaZero: Polygames. It is even competitive with Polygames when Polygames uses 100 times more GPU (at least for some games). One of the keys to the superior performance is that the cost of generating state data for training is approximately 296 times lower with Ath\'enan. With the same reasonable ressources, Ath\'enan without reinforcement heuristic is at least 7 times faster than Polygames and much more than 30 times faster with reinforcement heuristic.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and communication networks are expected to have groundbreaking synergies for 6G. Connecting GenAI agents via a wireless network can potentially unleash the power of Collective Intelligence (CI) and pave the way for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, current wireless networks are designed as a "data pipe" and are not suited to accommodate and leverage the power of GenAI. In this paper, we propose the GenAINet framework in which distributed GenAI agents communicate knowledge (facts, experiences, and methods) to accomplish arbitrary tasks. We first propose an architecture for a single GenAI agent and then provide a network architecture integrating GenAI capabilities to manage both network protocols and applications. Building on this, we investigate effective communication and reasoning problems by proposing a semantic-native GenAINet. Specifically, GenAI agents extract semantics from heterogeneous raw data, build and maintain a knowledge model representing the semantic relationships among pieces of knowledge, which is retrieved by GenAI models for planning and reasoning. Under this paradigm, different levels of collaboration can be achieved flexibly depending on the complexity of targeted tasks. Furthermore, we conduct two case studies in which, through wireless device queries, we demonstrate that extracting, compressing and transferring common knowledge can improve query accuracy while reducing communication costs; and in the wireless power control problem, we show that distributed agents can complete general tasks independently through collaborative reasoning without predefined communication protocols. Finally, we discuss challenges and future research directions in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) in 6G networks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing in healthcare, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of services across various specialties, including cardiology, ophthalmology, dermatology, emergency medicine, etc. AI applications have significantly improved diagnostic accuracy, treatment personalization, and patient outcome predictions by leveraging technologies such as machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing. However, these advancements also introduce substantial ethical and fairness challenges, particularly related to biases in data and algorithms. These biases can lead to disparities in healthcare delivery, affecting diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes across different demographic groups. This review paper examines the integration of AI in healthcare, highlighting critical challenges related to bias and exploring strategies for mitigation. We emphasize the necessity of diverse datasets, fairness-aware algorithms, and regulatory frameworks to ensure equitable healthcare delivery. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, advocating for interdisciplinary approaches, transparency in AI decision-making, and the development of innovative and inclusive AI applications.

Abstract: Connectionist approaches to machine learning, \emph{i.e.} neural networks, are enjoying a considerable vogue right now. However, these methods require large volumes of data and produce models that are uninterpretable to humans. An alternative framework that is compatible with neural networks and gradient-based learning, but explicitly models compositionality, is Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). VSAs are a family of algebras on high-dimensional vector representations. They arose in cognitive science from the need to unify neural processing and the kind of symbolic reasoning that humans perform. While machine learning methods have benefited from category-theoretical analyses, VSAs have not yet received similar treatment. In this paper, we present a first attempt at applying category theory to VSAs. Specifically, We generalise from vectors to co-presheaves, and describe VSA operations as the right Kan extensions of the external tensor product. This formalisation involves a proof that the right Kan extension in such cases can be expressed as simple, element-wise operations. We validate our formalisation with worked examples that connect to current VSA implementations, while suggesting new possible designs for VSAs.

<title>Recursive Inference Scaling: A Winning Path to Scalable Inference in Language and Multimodal Systems</title>

Abstract: Inspired by recent findings on the fractal geometry of language, we introduce Recursive INference Scaling (RINS) as a complementary, plug-in recipe for scaling inference time in language and multimodal systems. RINS is a particular form of recursive depth that significantly outperforms +55 other variants, including the recent "repeat-all-over" (RAO) strategy in Mobile LLM (Liu et al., 2024) and latent recurrent thinking (Geiping et al., 2025). Unlike prior works, we carry out our comparisons on a compute-matched regime, and demonstrate that for a fixed model size and training compute budget, RINS substantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes beyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a +2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by deriving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic performance limits and the scaling exponents. More importantly, with light-weight (linear) adapters (comprising <1% of model parameters) and stochastic dropout, RINS offers a no-regret strategy, meaning that RINS-enabled pretraining improves performance in language modeling even when recursive depth is not applied at inference time. This corresponds to improving performance on a training compute-, parameter-, and inference-matched regime, suggesting its potential as a viable component of LLM pretraining!

<title>A novel approach to navigate the taxonomic hierarchy to address the Open-World Scenarios in Medicinal Plant Classification</title>

Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel approach for plant hierarchical taxonomy classification by posing the problem as an open class problem. It is observed that existing methods for medicinal plant classification often fail to perform hierarchical classification and accurately identifying unknown species, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensive plant taxonomy classification. Thus we address the problem of unknown species classification by assigning it best hierarchical labels. We propose a novel method, which integrates DenseNet121, Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA) and cascaded classifiers for hierarchical classification. The approach systematically categorizes medicinal plants at multiple taxonomic levels, from phylum to species, ensuring detailed and precise classification. Using multi scale space attention, the model captures both local and global contextual information from the images, improving the distinction between similar species and the identification of new ones. It uses attention scores to focus on important features across multiple scales. The proposed method provides a solution for hierarchical classification, showcasing superior performance in identifying both known and unknown species. The model was tested on two state-of-art datasets with and without background artifacts and so that it can be deployed to tackle real word application. We used unknown species for testing our model. For unknown species the model achieved an average accuracy of 83.36%, 78.30%, 60.34% and 43.32% for predicting correct phylum, class, order and family respectively. Our proposed model size is almost four times less than the existing state of the art methods making it easily deploy able in real world application.

Abstract: The exponential growth of unstructured text data presents a fundamental challenge in modern data management and information retrieval. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, their potential to transform unstructured text into standardized, structured formats remains largely unexplored - a capability that could revolutionize data processing workflows across industries. This study breaks new ground by systematically evaluating LLMs' ability to convert unstructured recipe text into the structured Cooklang format. Through comprehensive testing of four models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama3.1:70b, and Llama3.1:8b), an innovative evaluation approach is introduced that combines traditional metrics (WER, ROUGE-L, TER) with specialized metrics for semantic element identification. Our experiments reveal that GPT-4o with few-shot prompting achieves breakthrough performance (ROUGE-L: 0.9722, WER: 0.0730), demonstrating for the first time that LLMs can reliably transform domain-specific unstructured text into structured formats without extensive training. Although model performance generally scales with size, we uncover surprising potential in smaller models like Llama3.1:8b for optimization through targeted fine-tuning. These findings open new possibilities for automated structured data generation across various domains, from medical records to technical documentation, potentially transforming the way organizations process and utilize unstructured information.

Abstract: The study of representation universality in AI models reveals growing convergence across domains, modalities, and architectures. However, the practical applications of representation universality remain largely unexplored. We bridge this gap by demonstrating that safety interventions can be transferred between models through learned mappings of their shared activation spaces. We demonstrate this approach on two well-established AI safety tasks: backdoor removal and refusal of harmful prompts, showing successful transfer of steering vectors that alter the models' outputs in a predictable way. Additionally, we propose a new task, \textit{corrupted capabilities}, where models are fine-tuned to embed knowledge tied to a backdoor. This tests their ability to separate useful skills from backdoors, reflecting real-world challenges. Extensive experiments across Llama, Qwen and Gemma model families show that our method enables using smaller models to efficiently align larger ones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that autoencoder mappings between base and fine-tuned models can serve as reliable ``lightweight safety switches", allowing dynamic toggling between model behaviors.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to discuss the potential of using methods from Reinforcement Learning for Life Cycle Assessment in a circular economy, and to present some new ideas in this direction. To give some context, we explain how Reinforcement Learning was successfully applied in computer chess (and beyond). As computer chess was historically called the "drosophila of AI", we start by describing a method for the board representation called 'rotated bitboards' that can potentially also be applied in the context of sustainability. In the first part of this paper, the concepts of the bitboard-representation and the advantages of (rotated) bitboards in move generation are explained. In order to illustrate those ideas practice, the concrete implementation of the move-generator in FUSc# (a chess engine developed at FU Berlin in C# some years ago) is described. In addition, rotated binary neural networks are discussed briefly.
  The second part deals with reinforcement learning in computer chess (and beyond). We exemplify the progress that has been made in this field in the last 15-20 years by comparing the "state of the art" from 2002-2008, when FUSc# was developed, with the ground-breaking innovations connected to "AlphaZero". We review some application of the ideas developed in AlphaZero in other domains, e.g. the "other Alphas" like AlphaFold, AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry and AlphaProof. In the final part of the paper, we discuss the computer-science related challenges that changing the economic paradigm towards (absolute) sustainability poses and in how far what we call 'progressive computer science' needs to contribute. Concrete challenges include the closing of material loops in a circular economy with Life Cycle Assessment in order to optimize for (absolute) sustainability, and we present some new ideas in this direction.

Abstract: There is a recent growing interest in applying Deep Learning techniques to tabular data, in order to replicate the success of other Artificial Intelligence areas in this structured domain. Specifically interesting is the case in which tabular data have a time dependence, such as, for instance financial transactions. However, the heterogeneity of the tabular values, in which categorical elements are mixed with numerical items, makes this adaptation difficult. In this paper we propose a Transformer architecture to represent heterogeneous time-dependent tabular data, in which numerical features are represented using a set of frequency functions and the whole network is uniformly trained with a unique loss function.

Abstract: Transformers are a neural network architecture originally developed for natural language processing, which have since become a foundational tool for solving a wide range of problems, including text, audio, image processing, reinforcement learning, and other tasks involving heterogeneous input data. Their hallmark is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh different parts of the input sequence dynamically, and is an evolution of earlier attention-based approaches. This article provides readers with the necessary background to understand recent research on transformer models, and presents the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of their core components. It also explores the architecture's various elements, potential modifications, and some of the most relevant applications. The article is written in Spanish to help make this scientific knowledge more accessible to the Spanish-speaking community.

Abstract: The intersection of Foundation Model (FM) and Federated Learning (FL) presents a unique opportunity to unlock new possibilities for real-world applications. On the one hand, FL, as a collaborative learning paradigm, help address challenges in FM development by expanding data availability, enabling computation sharing, facilitating the collaborative development of FMs, tackling continuous data update, avoiding FM monopoly, response delay and FM service down. On the other hand, FM, equipped with pre-trained knowledge and exceptional performance, can serve as a robust starting point for FL. It can also generate synthetic data to enrich data diversity and enhance overall performance of FL. Meanwhile, FM unlocks new sharing paradigm and multi-task and multi-modality capabilities for FL. By examining the interplay between FL and FM, this paper presents the motivations, challenges, and future directions of empowering FL with FM and empowering FM with FL. We hope that this work provides a good foundation to inspire future research efforts to drive advancements in both fields.

Abstract: This paper explores the potential impacts of large language models (LLMs) on the Chinese labor market. We analyze occupational exposure to LLM capabilities by incorporating human expertise and LLM classifications, following the methodology of Eloundou et al. (2023). The results indicate a positive correlation between occupational exposure and both wage levels and experience premiums at the occupation level. This suggests that higher-paying and experience-intensive jobs may face greater exposure risks from LLM-powered software. We then aggregate occupational exposure at the industry level to obtain industrial exposure scores. Both occupational and industrial exposure scores align with expert assessments. Our empirical analysis also demonstrates a distinct impact of LLMs, which deviates from the routinization hypothesis. We present a stylized theoretical framework to better understand this deviation from previous digital technologies. By incorporating entropy-based information theory into the task-based framework, we propose an AI learning theory that reveals a different pattern of LLM impacts compared to the routinization hypothesis.

Abstract: The agility of animals, particularly in complex activities such as running, turning, jumping, and backflipping, stands as an exemplar for robotic system design. Transferring this suite of behaviors to legged robotic systems introduces essential inquiries: How can a robot learn multiple locomotion behaviors simultaneously? How can the robot execute these tasks with a smooth transition? How to integrate these skills for wide-range applications? This paper introduces the Versatile Instructable Motion prior (VIM) - a Reinforcement Learning framework designed to incorporate a range of agile locomotion tasks suitable for advanced robotic applications. Our framework enables legged robots to learn diverse agile low-level skills by imitating animal motions and manually designed motions.

Abstract: Sharpness, a geometric measure in the parameter space that reflects the flatness of the loss landscape, has long been studied for its potential connections to neural network behavior. While sharpness is often associated with generalization, recent work highlights inconsistencies in this relationship, leaving its true significance unclear. In this paper, we investigate how sharpness influences the local geometric features of neural representations in feature space, offering a new perspective on its role. We introduce this problem and study three measures for compression: the Local Volumetric Ratio (LVR), based on volume compression, the Maximum Local Sensitivity (MLS), based on sensitivity to input changes, and the Local Dimensionality, based on how uniform the sensitivity is on different directions. We show that LVR and MLS correlate with the flatness of the loss around the local minima; and that this correlation is predicted by a relatively simple mathematical relationship: a flatter loss corresponds to a lower upper bound on the compression metrics of neural representations. Our work builds upon the linear stability insight by Ma and Ying, deriving inequalities between various compression metrics and quantities involving sharpness. Our inequalities readily extend to reparametrization-invariant sharpness as well. Through empirical experiments on various feedforward, convolutional, and transformer architectures, we find that our inequalities predict a consistently positive correlation between local representation compression and sharpness.

Abstract: The capability of generalization is a cornerstone for the success of modern learning systems. For non-Euclidean data, e.g., graphs, that particularly involves topological structures, one important aspect neglected by prior studies is how machine learning models generalize under topological shifts. This paper proposes AdvDIFFormer, a physics-inspired graph Transformer model designed to address this challenge. The model is derived from advective diffusion equations which describe a class of continuous message passing process with observed and latent topological structures. We show that AdvDIFFormer has provable capability for controlling generalization error with topological shifts, which in contrast cannot be guaranteed by graph diffusion models. Empirically, the model demonstrates superiority in various predictive tasks across information networks, molecular screening and protein interactions.

Abstract: Clustering of time series is a well-studied problem, with applications ranging from quantitative, personalized models of metabolism obtained from metabolite concentrations to state discrimination in quantum information theory. We consider a variant, where given a set of trajectories and a number of parts, we jointly partition the set of trajectories and learn linear dynamical system (LDS) models for each part, so as to minimize the maximum error across all the models. We present globally convergent methods and EM heuristics, accompanied by promising computational results. The key highlight of this method is that it does not require a predefined hidden state dimension but instead provides an upper bound. Additionally, it offers guidance for determining regularization in the system identification.

Abstract: We introduce SMUTF (Schema Matching Using Generative Tags and Hybrid Features), a unique approach for large-scale tabular data schema matching (SM), which assumes that supervised learning does not affect performance in open-domain tasks, thereby enabling effective cross-domain matching. This system uniquely combines rule-based feature engineering, pre-trained language models, and generative large language models. In an innovative adaptation inspired by the Humanitarian Exchange Language, we deploy "generative tags" for each data column, enhancing the effectiveness of SM. SMUTF exhibits extensive versatility, working seamlessly with any pre-existing pre-trained embeddings, classification methods, and generative models.
  Recognizing the lack of extensive, publicly available datasets for SM, we have created and open-sourced the HDXSM dataset from the public humanitarian data. We believe this to be the most exhaustive SM dataset currently available. In evaluations across various public datasets and the novel HDXSM dataset, SMUTF demonstrated exceptional performance, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and improving the F1 score by 11.84% and the AUC of ROC by 5.08%.

Abstract: To defend against privacy leakage of user data, differential privacy is widely used in federated learning, but it is not free. The addition of noise randomly disrupts the semantic integrity of the model and this disturbance accumulates with increased communication rounds. In this paper, we introduce a novel federated learning framework with rigorous privacy guarantees, named FedCEO, designed to strike a trade-off between model utility and user privacy by letting clients ''Collaborate with Each Other''. Specifically, we perform efficient tensor low-rank proximal optimization on stacked local model parameters at the server, demonstrating its capability to flexibly truncate high-frequency components in spectral space. This capability implies that our FedCEO can effectively recover the disrupted semantic information by smoothing the global semantic space for different privacy settings and continuous training processes. Moreover, we improve the SOTA utility-privacy trade-off bound by order of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the input dimension. We illustrate our theoretical results with experiments on representative datasets and observe significant performance improvements and strict privacy guarantees under different privacy settings. The code is available at https://github.com/6lyc/FedCEO_Collaborate-with-Each-Other.

Abstract: Existing models encounter bottlenecks in balancing performance and computational efficiency when modeling long sequences. Although the state space model (SSM) has achieved remarkable success in handling long sequence tasks, it still faces the problem of large number of parameters. In order to further improve the efficiency of SSM, we propose a new state space layer based on multiple-input multiple-output SSM, called efficient SSM (eSSM). Our eSSM is built on the convolutional representation of multi-input and multi-input (MIMO) SSM. We propose a variety of effective strategies to improve the computational efficiency. The diagonalization of the system matrix first decouples the original system. Then a fast tensor convolution is proposed based on the fast Fourier transform. In addition, the block diagonalization of the SSM further reduces the model parameters and improves the model flexibility. Extensive experimental results show that the performance of the proposed model on multiple databases matches the performance of state-of-the-art models, such as S4, and is significantly better than Transformers and LSTM. In the model efficiency benchmark, the parameters of eSSM are only 12.89\% of LSTM and 13.24\% of Mamba. The training speed of eSSM is 3.94 times faster than LSTM and 1.35 times faster than Mamba.

<title>REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories</title>

Abstract: Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.5\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.

<title>DECIDER: A Dual-System Rule-Controllable Decoding Framework for Language Generation</title>

Abstract: Constrained decoding approaches aim to control the meaning or style of text generated by the pre-trained large language models (LLMs or also PLMs) for various tasks at inference time. However, these methods often guide plausible continuations by greedily and explicitly selecting targets. Though fulfilling the task requirements, these methods may overlook certain general and natural logics that humans would implicitly follow towards such targets. Inspired by cognitive dual-process theory, in this work, we propose a novel decoding framework DECIDER where the base LLMs are equipped with a First-Order Logic (FOL) reasoner to express and evaluate the rules, along with a decision function that merges the outputs of both systems to guide the generation. Unlike previous constrained decodings, DECIDER transforms the encouragement of target-specific words into all words that satisfy several high-level rules, enabling us to programmatically integrate our logic into LLMs. Experiments on CommonGen and PersonaChat demonstrate that DECIDER effectively follows given FOL rules to guide LLMs in a more human-like and logic-controlled manner.

<title>Impact of Noisy Supervision in Foundation Model Learning</title>

Abstract: Foundation models are usually pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then adapted to downstream tasks through tuning. However, the large-scale pre-training datasets, often inaccessible or too expensive to handle, can contain label noise that may adversely affect the generalization of the model and pose unexpected risks. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively understand and analyze the nature of noise in pre-training datasets and then effectively mitigate its impacts on downstream tasks. Specifically, through extensive experiments of fully-supervised and image-text contrastive pre-training on synthetic noisy ImageNet-1K, YFCC15M, and CC12M datasets, we demonstrate that, while slight noise in pre-training can benefit in-domain (ID) performance, where the training and testing data share a similar distribution, it always deteriorates out-of-domain (OOD) performance, where training and testing distributions are significantly different. These observations are agnostic to scales of pre-training datasets, pre-training noise types, model architectures, pre-training objectives, downstream tuning methods, and downstream applications. We empirically ascertain that the reason behind this is that the pre-training noise shapes the feature space differently. We then propose a tuning method (NMTune) to affine the feature space to mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization, which is applicable in both parameter-efficient and black-box tuning manners. We additionally conduct extensive experiments on popular vision and language models, including APIs, which are supervised and self-supervised pre-trained on realistic noisy data for evaluation. Our analysis and results demonstrate the importance of this novel and fundamental research direction, which we term as Noisy Model Learning.

Abstract: How physical networks of neurons, bound by spatio-temporal locality constraints, can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.

Abstract: We propose CHOSEN, a simple yet flexible, robust and effective multi-view depth refinement framework. It can be employed in any existing multi-view stereo pipeline, with straightforward generalization capability for different multi-view capture systems such as camera relative positioning and lenses. Given an initial depth estimation, CHOSEN iteratively re-samples and selects the best hypotheses, and automatically adapts to different metric or intrinsic scales determined by the capture system. The key to our approach is the application of contrastive learning in an appropriate solution space and a carefully designed hypothesis feature, based on which positive and negative hypotheses can be effectively distinguished. Integrated in a simple baseline multi-view stereo pipeline, CHOSEN delivers impressive quality in terms of depth and normal accuracy compared to many current deep learning based multi-view stereo pipelines.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly large language models (LLMs), in finance has garnered increasing academic attention. Despite progress, existing studies predominantly focus on tasks like financial text summarization, question-answering, and stock movement prediction (binary classification), the application of LLMs to financial risk prediction remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, in this paper, we introduce RiskLabs, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze and predict financial risks. RiskLabs uniquely integrates multimodal financial data, including textual and vocal information from Earnings Conference Calls (ECCs), market-related time series data, and contextual news data to improve financial risk prediction. Empirical results demonstrate RiskLabs' effectiveness in forecasting both market volatility and variance. Through comparative experiments, we examine the contributions of different data sources to financial risk assessment and highlight the crucial role of LLMs in this process. We also discuss the challenges associated with using LLMs for financial risk prediction and explore the potential of combining them with multimodal data for this purpose.

Abstract: A core data-centric learning challenge is the identification of training samples that are detrimental to model performance. Influence functions serve as a prominent tool for this task and offer a robust framework for assessing training data influence on model predictions. Despite their widespread use, their high computational cost associated with calculating the inverse of the Hessian matrix pose constraints, particularly when analyzing large-sized deep models. In this paper, we establish a bridge between identifying detrimental training samples via influence functions and outlier gradient detection. This transformation not only presents a straightforward and Hessian-free formulation but also provides insights into the role of the gradient in sample impact. Through systematic empirical evaluations, we first validate the hypothesis of our proposed outlier gradient analysis approach on synthetic datasets. We then demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting mislabeled samples in vision models and selecting data samples for improving performance of natural language processing transformer models. We also extend its use to influential sample identification for fine-tuning Large Language Models.

<title>From Human Judgements to Predictive Models: Unravelling Acceptability in Code-Mixed Sentences</title>

Abstract: Current computational approaches for analysing or generating code-mixed sentences do not explicitly model ``naturalness'' or ``acceptability'' of code-mixed sentences, but rely on training corpora to reflect distribution of acceptable code-mixed sentences. Modelling human judgement for the acceptability of code-mixed text can help in distinguishing natural code-mixed text and enable quality-controlled generation of code-mixed text. To this end, we construct Cline - a dataset containing human acceptability judgements for English-Hindi~(en-hi) code-mixed text. Cline is the largest of its kind with 16,642 sentences, consisting of samples sourced from two sources: synthetically generated code-mixed text and samples collected from online social media. Our analysis establishes that popular code-mixing metrics such as CMI, Number of Switch Points, Burstines, which are used to filter/curate/compare code-mixed corpora have low correlation with human acceptability judgements, underlining the necessity of our dataset. Experiments using Cline demonstrate that simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models when trained solely using code-mixing metrics as features are outperformed by fine-tuned pre-trained Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, among Encoder models XLM-Roberta and Bernice outperform IndicBERT across different configurations. Among Encoder-Decoder models, mBART performs better than mT5, however Encoder-Decoder models are not able to outperform Encoder-only models. Decoder-only models perform the best when compared to all other MLLMS, with Llama 3.2 - 3B models outperforming similarly sized Qwen, Phi models. Comparison with zero and fewshot capabilitites of ChatGPT show that MLLMs fine-tuned on larger data outperform ChatGPT, providing scope for improvement in code-mixed tasks. Zero-shot transfer from En-Hi to En-Te acceptability judgments are better than random baselines.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a series of techniques that generate high-quality artificial data by manipulating existing data samples. By leveraging data augmentation techniques, AI models can achieve significantly improved applicability in tasks involving scarce or imbalanced datasets, thereby substantially enhancing AI models' generalization capabilities. Existing literature surveys only focus on a certain type of specific modality data, and categorize these methods from modality-specific and operation-centric perspectives, which lacks a consistent summary of data augmentation methods across multiple modalities and limits the comprehension of how existing data samples serve the data augmentation process. To bridge this gap, we propose a more enlightening taxonomy that encompasses data augmentation techniques for different common data modalities. Specifically, from a data-centric perspective, this survey proposes a modality-independent taxonomy by investigating how to take advantage of the intrinsic relationship between data samples, including single-wise, pair-wise, and population-wise sample data augmentation methods. Additionally, we categorize data augmentation methods across five data modalities through a unified inductive approach.

Abstract: In machine learning practice it is often useful to identify relevant input features, so as to obtain compact dataset for more efficient numerical handling. On the other hand, by isolating key input elements, ranked according their respective degree of relevance, can help to elaborate on the process of decision making. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate the relative importance of the input components for a Deep Neural Network. This is achieved by leveraging on a spectral re-parametrization of the optimization process. Eigenvalues associated to input nodes provide in fact a robust proxy to gauge the relevance of the supplied entry features. Notably, the spectral features ranking is performed automatically, as a byproduct of the network training, with no additional processing to be carried out. The technique is successfully challenged against both synthetic and real data.

arXiv:2406.08918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In differentially private (DP) machine learning, the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms are often reported and compared on the basis of a single $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-pair. This practice overlooks that DP guarantees can vary substantially even between mechanisms sharing a given $(\varepsilon, \delta)$, and potentially introduces privacy vulnerabilities which can remain undetected. This motivates the need for robust, rigorous methods for comparing DP guarantees in such cases. Here, we introduce the $\Delta$-divergence between mechanisms which quantifies the worst-case excess privacy vulnerability of choosing one mechanism over another in terms of $(\varepsilon, \delta)$, $f$-DP and in terms of a newly presented Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, as a generalisation of the Blackwell theorem, it is endowed with strong decision-theoretic foundations. Through application examples, we show that our techniques can facilitate informed decision-making and reveal gaps in the current understanding of privacy risks, as current practices in DP-SGD often result in choosing mechanisms with high excess privacy vulnerabilities.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of providing a novel approach to sourcing significant training data for LLMs focused on science and engineering. In particular, a crucial challenge is sourcing parallel scientific codes in the ranges of millions to billions of codes. To tackle this problem, we propose an automated pipeline framework called LASSI, designed to translate between parallel programming languages by bootstrapping existing closed- or open-source LLMs. LASSI incorporates autonomous enhancement through self-correcting loops where errors encountered during the compilation and execution of generated code are fed back to the LLM through guided prompting for debugging and refactoring. We highlight the bi-directional translation of existing GPU benchmarks between OpenMP target offload and CUDA to validate LASSI. The results of evaluating LASSI with different application codes across four LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of LASSI for generating executable parallel codes, with 80% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 85% of CUDA to OpenMP translations producing the expected output. We also observe approximately 78% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 62% of CUDA to OpenMP translations execute within 10% of or at a faster runtime than the original benchmark code in the same language.

Abstract: Distributed deep learning in resource-constrained environments faces scalability and generalization challenges due to large effective batch sizes and non-identically distributed client data. We introduce a server-driven sampling strategy that maintains a fixed global batch size by dynamically adjusting client-side batch sizes. This decouples the effective batch size from the number of participating devices and ensures that global batches better reflect the overall data distribution. Using standard concentration bounds, we establish tighter deviation guarantees compared to existing approaches. Empirical results on a benchmark dataset confirm that the proposed method improves model accuracy, training efficiency, and convergence stability, offering a scalable solution for learning at the network edge.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language processing tasks, they still struggle with generating logically sound arguments, resulting in potential risks such as spreading misinformation. To address this issue, we introduce FIPO, a fallacy-informed framework that leverages preference optimization methods to steer LLMs toward logically sound arguments. FIPO includes a classification loss, to capture the fine-grained information on fallacy types. Our results on argumentation datasets show that our method reduces the fallacy errors by up to 17.5%. Furthermore, our human evaluation results indicate that the quality of the generated arguments by our method significantly outperforms the fine-tuned baselines, as well as other preference optimization methods, such as DPO.

Abstract: Molecular optimization is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, aimed at refining molecular structures to enhance drug efficacy and minimize side effects, ultimately accelerating the overall drug development process. Many target-based molecular optimization methods have been proposed, significantly advancing drug discovery. These methods primarily on understanding the specific drug target structures or their hypothesized roles in combating diseases. However, challenges such as a limited number of available targets and a difficulty capturing clear structures hinder innovative drug development. In contrast, phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) does not depend on clear target structures and can identify hits with novel and unbiased polypharmacology signatures. As a result, PDD-based molecular optimization can reduce potential safety risks while optimizing phenotypic activity, thereby increasing the likelihood of clinical success. Therefore, we propose a fragment-masked molecular optimization method based on PDD (FMOP). FMOP employs a regression-free diffusion model to conditionally optimize the molecular masked regions without training, effectively generating new molecules with similar scaffolds. On the large-scale drug response dataset GDSCv2, we optimize the potential molecules across all 945 cell lines. The overall experiments demonstrate that the in-silico optimization success rate reaches 94.4%, with an average efficacy increase of 5.3%. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation and visualization experiments, confirming that FMOP is an effective and robust molecular optimization method. The code is available at:https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FMOP-98C2.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling diverse modalities and tasks, outperforming conventional artificial intelligence (AI) approaches that are highly task-specific and modality-reliant. In the medical domain, however, the development of comprehensive foundation models is constrained by limited access to diverse modalities and stringent privacy regulations. To address these constraints, this study introduces a novel knowledge injection approach, FedKIM, designed to scale the medical foundation model within a federated learning framework. FedKIM leverages lightweight local models to extract healthcare knowledge from private data and integrates this knowledge into a centralized foundation model using a designed adaptive Multitask Multimodal Mixture Of Experts (M3OE) module. This method not only preserves privacy but also enhances the model's ability to handle complex medical tasks involving multiple modalities. Our extensive experiments across twelve tasks in seven modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKIM in various settings, highlighting its potential to scale medical foundation models without direct access to sensitive data.

Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm that enables decentralized clients to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping all the training data local. While considerable research has focused on federated image generation, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders have received less attention. In this paper, we address the challenges of non-IID (independently and identically distributed) data environments featuring multiple groups of images of different types. Non-IID data distributions can lead to difficulties in maintaining a consistent latent space and can also result in local generators with disparate texture features being blended during aggregation. We thereby introduce FissionVAE that decouples the latent space and constructs decoder branches tailored to individual client groups. This method allows for customized learning that aligns with the unique data distributions of each group. Additionally, we incorporate hierarchical VAEs and demonstrate the use of heterogeneous decoder architectures within FissionVAE. We also explore strategies for setting the latent prior distributions to enhance the decoupling process. To evaluate our approach, we assemble two composite datasets: the first combines MNIST and FashionMNIST; the second comprises RGB datasets of cartoon and human faces, wild animals, marine vessels, and remote sensing images. Our experiments demonstrate that FissionVAE greatly improves generation quality on these datasets compared to baseline federated VAE models.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various fields, from natural language processing to sectors like medicine and finance. However, despite their rapid proliferation, the applications of LLMs in telecommunications remain limited, often relying on general-purpose models that lack domain-specific specialization. This lack of specialization results in underperformance, particularly when dealing with telecommunications-specific technical terminology and their associated mathematical representations. This paper addresses this gap by first creating and disseminating Tele-Data, a comprehensive dataset of telecommunications material curated from relevant sources, and Tele-Eval, a large-scale question-and-answer dataset tailored to the domain. Through extensive experiments, we explore the most effective training techniques for adapting LLMs to the telecommunications domain, ranging from examining the division of expertise across various telecommunications aspects to employing parameter-efficient techniques. We also investigate how models of different sizes behave during adaptation and analyze the impact of their training data on this behavior. Leveraging these findings, we develop and open-source Tele-LLMs, the first series of language models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, specifically tailored for telecommunications. Our evaluations demonstrate that these models outperform their general-purpose counterparts on Tele-Eval and telecommunications-related literature tasks while retaining their previously acquired capabilities, thus avoiding the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon.

<title>M3-Jepa: Multimodal Alignment via Multi-directional MoE based on the JEPA framework</title>

Abstract: Current multimodal alignment strategies primarily use single or unified modality encoders, while optimizing the alignment on the original token space. Such a framework is easy to implement and incorporate with the pretrained knowledge, but might result in information bias. To deal with such issues, the joint encoding predictive architecture (JEPA) learns the alignment loss on the latent space, with a predictor to convert the input encoding to the output latent space. However, the application of JEPA in multimodal scenarios is limited so far. In this paper, we introduce M3-Jepa, a scalable multimodal alignment framework, with the predictor implemented by a multi-directional mixture of experts (MoE). We demonstrate the framework can maximize the mutual information with information theory derivations, by alternating the optimization between different uni-directional tasks. By thoroughly designed experiments, we show that M3-Jepa can obtain state-of-the-art performance on different modalities and tasks, generalize to unseen datasets and domains, and is computationally efficient in training and inference. Our study indicates that M3-Jepa might provide a new paradigm to self-supervised learning and open-world modeling.

<title>Constructive Approach to Bidirectional Influence between Qualia Structure and Language Emergence</title>

arXiv:2409.09413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This perspective paper explores the bidirectional influence between language emergence and the relational structure of subjective experiences, termed qualia structure, and lays out a constructive approach to the intricate dependency between the two. We hypothesize that the emergence of languages with distributional semantics (e.g., syntactic-semantic structures) is linked to the coordination of internal representations shaped by experience, potentially facilitating more structured language through reciprocal influence. This hypothesized mutual dependency connects to recent advancements in AI and symbol emergence robotics, and is explored within this paper through theoretical frameworks such as the collective predictive coding. Computational studies show that neural network-based language models form systematically structured internal representations, and multimodal language models can share representations between language and perceptual information. This perspective suggests that language emergence serves not only as a mechanism creating a communication tool but also as a mechanism for allowing people to realize shared understanding of qualitative experiences. The paper discusses the implications of this bidirectional influence in the context of consciousness studies, linguistics, and cognitive science, and outlines future constructive research directions to further explore this dynamic relationship between language emergence and qualia structure.

Abstract: In various applications, the multivariate time series often suffers from missing data. This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/

<title>Hard-Constrained Neural Networks with Universal Approximation Guarantees</title>

Abstract: Incorporating prior knowledge or specifications of input-output relationships into machine learning models has gained significant attention, as it enhances generalization from limited data and leads to conforming outputs. However, most existing approaches use soft constraints by penalizing violations through regularization, which offers no guarantee of constraint satisfaction--an essential requirement in safety-critical applications. On the other hand, imposing hard constraints on neural networks may hinder their representational power, adversely affecting performance. To address this, we propose HardNet, a practical framework for constructing neural networks that inherently satisfy hard constraints without sacrificing model capacity. Unlike approaches that modify outputs only at inference time, HardNet enables end-to-end training with hard constraint guarantees, leading to improved performance. To the best of our knowledge, HardNet is the first method with an efficient forward pass to enforce more than one input-dependent inequality constraint. It allows unconstrained optimization of the network parameters using standard algorithms by appending a differentiable closed-form enforcement layer to the network's output. Furthermore, we show that HardNet retains the universal approximation capabilities of neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of HardNet across various applications: learning with piecewise constraints, learning optimization solvers, optimizing control policies in safety-critical systems, and learning safe decision logic for aircraft systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become integral to large language models (LLMs), particularly for conversational AI systems where user questions may reference knowledge beyond the LLMs' training cutoff. However, many natural user questions lack well-defined answers, either due to limited domain knowledge or because the retrieval system returns documents that are relevant in appearance but uninformative in content. In such cases, LLMs often produce hallucinated answers without flagging them. While recent work has largely focused on questions with false premises, we study out-of-scope questions, where the retrieved document appears semantically similar to the question but lacks the necessary information to answer it. In this paper, we propose a guided hallucination-based approach ELOQ to automatically generate a diverse set of out-of-scope questions from post-cutoff documents, followed by human verification to ensure quality. We use this dataset to evaluate several LLMs on their ability to detect out-of-scope questions and generate appropriate responses. Finally, we introduce an improved detection method that enhances the reliability of LLM-based question-answering systems in handling out-of-scope questions.

Abstract: Few-Shot Open-Set Recognition (FSOSR) targets a critical real-world challenge, aiming to categorize inputs into known categories, termed closed-set classes, while identifying open-set inputs that fall outside these classes. Although transfer learning where a model is tuned to a given few-shot task has become a prominent paradigm in closed-world, we observe that it fails to expand to open-world. To unlock this challenge, we propose a two-stage method which consists of open-set aware meta-learning with open-set free transfer learning. In the open-set aware meta-learning stage, a model is trained to establish a metric space that serves as a beneficial starting point for the subsequent stage. During the open-set free transfer learning stage, the model is further adapted to a specific target task through transfer learning. Additionally, we introduce a strategy to simulate open-set examples by modifying the training dataset or generating pseudo open-set examples. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely recognized benchmarks, miniImageNet and tieredImageNet, with only a 1.5\% increase in training effort. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in FSOSR.

<title>Large Language Model with Region-guided Referring and Grounding for CT Report Generation</title>

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) report generation is crucial to assist radiologists in interpreting CT volumes, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Existing methods primarily only consider the global features of the entire volume, making it struggle to focus on specific regions and potentially missing abnormalities. To address this issue, we propose Reg2RG, the first region-guided referring and grounding framework for CT report generation, which enhances diagnostic performance by focusing on anatomical regions within the volume. Specifically, we utilize masks from a universal segmentation module to capture local features for each referring region. A local feature decoupling (LFD) strategy is proposed to preserve the local high-resolution details with little computational overhead. Then the local features are integrated with global features to capture inter-regional relationships within a cohesive context. Moreover, we propose a novel region-report alignment (RRA) training strategy. It leverages the recognition of referring regions to guide the generation of region-specific reports, enhancing the model's referring and grounding capabilities while also improving the report's interpretability. A large language model (LLM) is further employed as the language decoder to generate reports from integrated visual features, facilitating region-level comprehension. Extensive experiments on two large-scale chest CT-report datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, which outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of both natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics while preserving promising interpretability. The code is available at https://github.com/zhi-xuan-chen/Reg2RG.

Abstract: Achieving precise alignment between textual instructions and generated images in text-to-image generation is a significant challenge, particularly in rendering written text within images. Sate-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3), Flux, and AuraFlow still struggle with accurate text depiction, resulting in misspelled or inconsistent text. We introduce a training-free method with minimal computational overhead that significantly enhances text rendering quality. Specifically, we introduce an overshooting sampler for pretrained rectified flow (RF) models, by alternating between over-simulating the learned ordinary differential equation (ODE) and reintroducing noise. Compared to the Euler sampler, the overshooting sampler effectively introduces an extra Langevin dynamics term that can help correct the compounding error from successive Euler steps and therefore improve the text rendering. However, when the overshooting strength is high, we observe over-smoothing artifacts on the generated images. To address this issue, we propose an Attention Modulated Overshooting sampler (AMO), which adaptively controls the strength of overshooting for each image patch according to their attention score with the text content. AMO demonstrates a 32.3% and 35.9% improvement in text rendering accuracy on SD3 and Flux without compromising overall image quality or increasing inference cost.

Abstract: We present LiDAR-EDIT, a novel paradigm for generating synthetic LiDAR data for autonomous driving. Our framework edits real-world LiDAR scans by introducing new object layouts while preserving the realism of the background environment. Compared to end-to-end frameworks that generate LiDAR point clouds from scratch, LiDAR-EDIT offers users full control over the object layout, including the number, type, and pose of objects, while keeping most of the original real-world background. Our method also provides object labels for the generated data. Compared to novel view synthesis techniques, our framework allows for the creation of counterfactual scenarios with object layouts significantly different from the original real-world scene. LiDAR-EDIT uses spherical voxelization to enforce correct LiDAR projective geometry in the generated point clouds by construction. During object removal and insertion, generative models are employed to fill the unseen background and object parts that were occluded in the original real LiDAR scans. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework produces realistic LiDAR scans with practical value for downstream tasks.

Abstract: This study introduces PINN4PF, an end-to-end deep learning architecture for power flow (PF) analysis that effectively captures the nonlinear dynamics of large-scale modern power systems. The proposed neural network (NN) architecture consists of two important advancements in the training pipeline: (A) a double-head feed-forward NN that aligns with PF analysis, including an activation function that adjusts to the net active and reactive power injections patterns, and (B) a physics-based loss function that partially incorporates power system topology information. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated through 4-bus, 15-bus, 290-bus, and 2224-bus test systems and is evaluated against two baselines: a linear regression model (LR) and a black-box NN (MLP). The comparison is based on (i) generalization ability, (ii) robustness, (iii) impact of training dataset size on generalization ability, (iv) accuracy in approximating derived PF quantities (specifically line current, line active power, and line reactive power), and (v) scalability. Results demonstrate that PINN4PF outperforms both baselines across all test systems by up to two orders of magnitude not only in terms of direct criteria, e.g., generalization ability, but also in terms of approximating derived physical quantities.

Abstract: Large language models with retrieval-augmented generation encounter a pivotal challenge in intricate retrieval tasks, e.g., multi-hop question answering, which requires the model to navigate across multiple documents and generate comprehensive responses based on fragmented information. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel Knowledge Graph-based RAG framework with a hierarchical knowledge retriever, termed KG-Retriever. The retrieval indexing in KG-Retriever is constructed on a hierarchical index graph that consists of a knowledge graph layer and a collaborative document layer. The associative nature of graph structures is fully utilized to strengthen intra-document and inter-document connectivity, thereby fundamentally alleviating the information fragmentation problem and meanwhile improving the retrieval efficiency in cross-document retrieval of LLMs. With the coarse-grained collaborative information from neighboring documents and concise information from the knowledge graph, KG-Retriever achieves marked improvements on five public QA datasets, showing the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed RAG framework.

Abstract: Image editing has advanced significantly with the development of diffusion models using both inversion-based and instruction-based methods. However, current inversion-based approaches struggle with big modifications (e.g., adding or removing objects) due to the structured nature of inversion noise, which hinders substantial changes. Meanwhile, instruction-based methods often constrain users to black-box operations, limiting direct interaction for specifying editing regions and intensity. To address these limitations, we propose BrushEdit, a novel inpainting-based instruction-guided image editing paradigm, which leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image inpainting models to enable autonomous, user-friendly, and interactive free-form instruction editing. Specifically, we devise a system enabling free-form instruction editing by integrating MLLMs and a dual-branch image inpainting model in an agent-cooperative framework to perform editing category classification, main object identification, mask acquisition, and editing area inpainting. Extensive experiments show that our framework effectively combines MLLMs and inpainting models, achieving superior performance across seven metrics including mask region preservation and editing effect coherence.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is an important machine learning task with many real-world uses, including fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and industrial monitoring. Within natural language processing (NLP), AD helps detect issues like spam, misinformation, and unusual user activity. Although large language models (LLMs) have had a strong impact on tasks such as text generation and summarization, their potential in AD has not been studied enough. This paper introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark that evaluates how LLMs can help with NLP anomaly detection. We examine three key tasks: (i) zero-shot detection, using LLMs' pre-trained knowledge to perform AD without tasks-specific training; (ii) data augmentation, generating synthetic data and category descriptions to improve AD models; and (iii) model selection, using LLMs to suggest unsupervised AD models. Through experiments with different datasets, we find that LLMs can work well in zero-shot AD, that carefully designed augmentation methods are useful, and that explaining model selection for specific datasets remains challenging. Based on these results, we outline six future research directions on LLMs for AD.

Abstract: Bidirectional transformers excel at sentiment analysis, and Large Language Models (LLM) are effective zero-shot learners. Might they perform better as a team? This paper explores collaborative approaches between ELECTRA and GPT-4o for three-way sentiment classification. We fine-tuned (FT) four models (ELECTRA Base/Large, GPT-4o/4o-mini) using a mix of reviews from Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) and DynaSent. We provided input from ELECTRA to GPT as: predicted label, probabilities, and retrieved examples. Sharing ELECTRA Base FT predictions with GPT-4o-mini significantly improved performance over either model alone (82.50 macro F1 vs. 79.14 ELECTRA Base FT, 79.41 GPT-4o-mini) and yielded the lowest cost/performance ratio (\$0.12/F1 point). However, when GPT models were fine-tuned, including predictions decreased performance. GPT-4o FT-M was the top performer (86.99), with GPT-4o-mini FT close behind (86.70) at much less cost (\$0.38 vs. \$1.59/F1 point). Our results show that augmenting prompts with predictions from fine-tuned encoders is an efficient way to boost performance, and a fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini is nearly as good as GPT-4o FT at 76% less cost. Both are affordable options for projects with limited resources.

Abstract: Predicting Bitcoin price remains a challenging problem due to the high volatility and complex non-linear dynamics of cryptocurrency markets. Traditional time-series models, such as ARIMA and GARCH, and recurrent neural networks, like LSTMs, have been widely applied to this task but struggle to capture the regime shifts and long-range dependencies inherent in the data. In this work, we propose CryptoMamba, a novel Mamba-based State Space Model (SSM) architecture designed to effectively capture long-range dependencies in financial time-series data. Our experiments show that CryptoMamba not only provides more accurate predictions but also offers enhanced generalizability across different market conditions, surpassing the limitations of previous models. Coupled with trading algorithms for real-world scenarios, CryptoMamba demonstrates its practical utility by translating accurate forecasts into financial outcomes. Our findings signal a huge advantage for SSMs in stock and cryptocurrency price forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Anatomical landmark localization in 2D/3D images is a critical task in medical imaging. Although many general-purpose tools exist for landmark localization in classical computer vision tasks, such as pose estimation, they lack the specialized features and modularity necessary for anatomical landmark localization applications in the medical domain. Therefore, we introduce landmarker, a Python package built on PyTorch. The package provides a comprehensive, flexible toolkit for developing and evaluating landmark localization algorithms, supporting a range of methodologies, including static and adaptive heatmap regression. landmarker enhances the accuracy of landmark identification, streamlines research and development processes, and supports various image formats and preprocessing pipelines. Its modular design allows users to customize and extend the toolkit for specific datasets and applications, accelerating innovation in medical imaging. landmarker addresses a critical need for precision and customization in landmark localization tasks not adequately met by existing general-purpose pose estimation tools.

<title>A Cognitive Paradigm Approach to Probe the Perception-Reasoning Interface in VLMs</title>

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence involves understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying visual reasoning in sophisticated models like Vision-Language Models (VLMs). How do these models integrate visual perception with abstract thought, especially when reasoning across multiple images or requiring fine-grained compositional understanding? Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, this paper introduces a structured evaluation framework using diverse visual reasoning tasks-Bongard Problems (BPs) and Winoground-to dissect the perception-reasoning interface in VLMs. We propose three distinct evaluation paradigms, mirroring human problem-solving strategies: Direct Visual Rule Learning (DVRL; holistic processing), Deductive Rule Learning (DRL; rule extraction and application), and Componential Analysis (CA; analytical decomposition via task-agnostic textual descriptions). These paradigms systematically vary cognitive load and probe processing stages. Notably, CA enables multi-image reasoning evaluation even for single-image architectures and isolates reasoning from perception by operating on textual descriptions. Applying this framework, we demonstrate that CA, leveraging powerful language models for reasoning over rich, independently generated descriptions, achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on challenging benchmarks including Bongard-OpenWorld, Bongard-HOI, and Winoground. Ablation studies confirm reasoning improves significantly when perceptual challenges are mitigated, revealing a critical perception bottleneck. Our framework provides a valuable diagnostic tool and suggests that decoupling perception (via rich, task-agnostic description) from reasoning is a promising direction for robust and general visual intelligence.

Abstract: The dream of achieving a student-teacher ratio of 1:1 is closer than ever thanks to the emergence of large language models (LLMs). One potential application of these models in the educational field would be to provide feedback to students in university introductory programming courses, so that a student struggling to solve a basic implementation problem could seek help from an LLM available 24/7. This article focuses on studying three aspects related to such an application. First, the performance of two well-known models, GPT-3.5T and GPT-4T, in providing feedback to students is evaluated. The empirical results showed that GPT-4T performs much better than GPT-3.5T, however, it is not yet ready for use in a real-world scenario. This is due to the possibility of generating incorrect information that potential users may not always be able to detect. Second, the article proposes a carefully designed prompt using in-context learning techniques that allows automating important parts of the evaluation process, as well as providing a lower bound for the fraction of feedbacks containing incorrect information, saving time and effort. This was possible because the resulting feedback has a programmatically analyzable structure that incorporates diagnostic information about the LLM's performance in solving the requested task. Third, the article also suggests a possible strategy for implementing a practical learning tool based on LLMs, which is rooted on the proposed prompting techniques. This strategy opens up a whole range of interesting possibilities from a pedagogical perspective.

<title>When Pre-trained Visual Representations Fall Short: Limitations in Visuo-Motor Robot Learning</title>

Abstract: The integration of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) into visuo-motor robot learning has emerged as a promising alternative to training visual encoders from scratch. However, PVRs face critical challenges in the context of policy learning, including temporal entanglement and an inability to generalise even in the presence of minor scene perturbations. These limitations hinder performance in tasks requiring temporal awareness and robustness to scene changes. This work identifies these shortcomings and proposes solutions to address them. First, we augment PVR features with temporal perception and a sense of task completion, effectively disentangling them in time. Second, we introduce a module that learns to selectively attend to task-relevant local features, enhancing robustness when evaluated on out-of-distribution scenes. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements, particularly in PVRs trained with masking objectives, and validate the effectiveness of our enhancements in addressing PVR-specific limitations.

<title>Unveiling the Mechanisms of Explicit CoT Training: How CoT Enhances Reasoning Generalization</title>

Abstract: The integration of explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into training large language models (LLMs) has advanced their reasoning capabilities, yet the mechanisms by which CoT enhances generalization remain poorly understood. This work investigates (1) \textit{how} CoT training reshapes internal model representations and (2) \textit{why} it improves both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning generalization. Through controlled experiments and theoretical analysis, we derive the following key insights. \textbf{1)} Structural Advantage: CoT training internalizes reasoning into a two-stage generalizing circuit, where the number of stages corresponds to the explicit reasoning steps during training. Notably, CoT-trained models resolve intermediate results at shallower layers compared to non-CoT counterparts, freeing up deeper layers to specialize in subsequent reasoning steps. \textbf{2)} Theoretical Analysis: the information-theoretic generalization bounds via distributional divergence can be decomposed into ID and OOD components. While ID error diminishes with sufficient training regardless of CoT, OOD error critically depends on CoT: Non-CoT training fails to generalize to OOD samples due to unseen reasoning patterns, whereas CoT training achieves near-perfect OOD generalization by mastering subtasks and reasoning compositions during training. The identified mechanisms explain our experimental results: CoT training accelerates convergence and enhances generalization from ID to both ID and OOD scenarios while maintaining robust performance even with tolerable noise. These findings are further validated on complex real-world datasets. This paper offers valuable insights for designing CoT strategies to enhance LLM reasoning robustness.

Abstract: Model-based offline reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to learn a policy by exploiting a dynamics model derived from an existing dataset. Applying conservative quantification to the dynamics model, most existing works on MORL generate trajectories that approximate the real data distribution to facilitate policy learning by using current information (e.g., the state and action at time step $t$). However, these works neglect the impact of historical information on environmental dynamics, leading to the generation of unreliable trajectories that may not align with the real data distribution. In this paper, we propose a new MORL algorithm \textbf{R}eliability-guaranteed \textbf{T}ransformer (RT), which can eliminate unreliable trajectories by calculating the cumulative reliability of the generated trajectory (i.e., using a weighted variational distance away from the real data). Moreover, by sampling candidate actions with high rewards, RT can efficiently generate high-return trajectories from the existing offline data. We theoretically prove the performance guarantees of RT in policy learning, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness against state-of-the-art model-based methods on several benchmark tasks.

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for text generation has led to widespread concerns about AI-generated content detection. However, an overlooked challenge is AI-polished text, where human-written content undergoes subtle refinements using AI tools. This raises a critical question: should minimally polished text be classified as AI-generated? Such classification can lead to false plagiarism accusations and misleading claims about AI prevalence in online content. In this study, we systematically evaluate twelve state-of-the-art AI-text detectors using our AI-Polished-Text Evaluation (APT-Eval) dataset, which contains 14.7K samples refined at varying AI-involvement levels. Our findings reveal that detectors frequently flag even minimally polished text as AI-generated, struggle to differentiate between degrees of AI involvement, and exhibit biases against older and smaller models. These limitations highlight the urgent need for more nuanced detection methodologies.

<title>Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs</title>

arXiv:2502.17424v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding. It asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned. Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment. In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger. It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.

Abstract: Human activity is moderated by norms. However, machines are often trained without explicit supervision on norm understanding and reasoning, particularly when norms are physically- or socially-grounded. To improve and evaluate the normative reasoning capability of vision-language models (VLMs), we present \dataset{} $\|\epsilon\|$, consisting of 1,853 challenging, multi-stage MCQ questions based on ego-centric videos of human interactions, evaluating both the prediction and justification of normative actions. The normative actions encompass seven categories: safety, privacy, proxemics, politeness, cooperation, coordination/proactivity, and communication/legibility. To compile this dataset at scale, we propose a novel pipeline leveraging video sampling, automatic answer generation, filtering, and human validation. Our work demonstrates that current state-of-the-art vision-language models lack robust norm understanding, scoring a maximum of 54\% on \dataset{} (versus a human bench of 92\%). Our analysis of performance in each dimension highlights the significant risks of safety, privacy, and the lack of collaboration and communication capability when applied to real-world agents. We additionally show that through a retrieval-based generation (RAG) method, it is possible to use \dataset{} to enhance normative reasoning in VLMs.

arXiv:2502.20727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid expansion in the scale of large language models (LLMs), enabling efficient distributed inference across multiple computing units has become increasingly critical. However, communication overheads from popular distributed inference techniques such as Tensor Parallelism pose a significant challenge to achieve scalability and low latency. Therefore, we introduce a novel optimization technique, Sync-Point Drop (SPD), to reduce communication overheads in tensor parallelism by selectively dropping synchronization on attention outputs. In detail, we first propose a block design that allows execution to proceed without communication through SPD. Second, we apply different SPD strategies to attention blocks based on their sensitivity to the model accuracy. The proposed methods effectively alleviate communication bottlenecks while minimizing accuracy degradation during LLM inference, offering a scalable solution for diverse distributed environments: SPD offered about 20% overall inference latency reduction with < 1% accuracy regression for LLaMA2-70B inference over 8 GPUs.

arXiv:2503.03269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers with linear attention offer significant computational advantages over softmax-based transformers but often suffer from degraded performance. The symmetric power (sympow) transformer, a particular type of linear transformer, addresses some of this performance gap by leveraging symmetric tensor embeddings, achieving comparable performance to softmax transformers. However, the finite capacity of the recurrent state in sympow transformers limits their ability to retain information, leading to performance degradation when scaling the training or evaluation context length. To address this issue, we propose the conformal-sympow transformer, which dynamically frees up capacity using data-dependent multiplicative gating and adaptively stores information using data-dependent rotary embeddings. Preliminary experiments on the LongCrawl64 dataset demonstrate that conformal-sympow overcomes the limitations of sympow transformers, achieving robust performance across scaled training and evaluation contexts.

Abstract: Effective trajectory stitching for long-horizon planning is a significant challenge in robotic decision-making. While diffusion models have shown promise in planning, they are limited to solving tasks similar to those seen in their training data. We propose CompDiffuser, a novel generative approach that can solve new tasks by learning to compositionally stitch together shorter trajectory chunks from previously seen tasks. Our key insight is modeling the trajectory distribution by subdividing it into overlapping chunks and learning their conditional relationships through a single bidirectional diffusion model. This allows information to propagate between segments during generation, ensuring physically consistent connections. We conduct experiments on benchmark tasks of various difficulties, covering different environment sizes, agent state dimension, trajectory types, training data quality, and show that CompDiffuser significantly outperforms existing methods.

arXiv:2503.06457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data heterogeneity in federated learning, characterized by a significant misalignment between local and global distributions, leads to divergent local optimization directions and hinders global model training. Existing studies mainly focus on optimizing local updates or global aggregation, but these indirect approaches demonstrate instability when handling highly heterogeneous data distributions, especially in scenarios where label skew and domain skew coexist. To address this, we propose a geometry-guided data generation method that centers on simulating the global embedding distribution locally. We first introduce the concept of the geometric shape of an embedding distribution and then address the challenge of obtaining global geometric shapes under privacy constraints. Subsequently, we propose GGEUR, which leverages global geometric shapes to guide the generation of new samples, enabling a closer approximation to the ideal global distribution. In single-domain scenarios, we augment samples based on global geometric shapes to enhance model generalization; in multi-domain scenarios, we further employ class prototypes to simulate the global distribution across domains. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the performance of existing approaches in handling highly heterogeneous data, including scenarios with label skew, domain skew, and their coexistence.

Abstract: Queer people are often discussed as targets of bias, harm, or discrimination in research on generative AI. However, the specific ways that queer people engage with generative AI, and thus possible uses that support queer people, have yet to be explored. We conducted a workshop study with 13 queer artists, during which we gave participants access to GPT-4 and DALL-E 3 and facilitated group sensemaking activities. We found our participants struggled to use these models due to various normative values embedded in their designs, such as hyper-positivity and anti-sexuality. We describe various strategies our participants developed to overcome these models' limitations and how, nevertheless, our participants found value in these highly-normative technologies. Drawing on queer feminist theory, we discuss implications for the conceptualization of "state-of-the-art" models and consider how FAccT researchers might support queer alternatives.

arXiv:2503.20500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural receivers have recently become a popular topic, where the received signals can be directly decoded by data driven mechanisms such as machine learning and deep learning. In this paper, we propose two novel neural network based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receivers performing channel estimation and equalization tasks and directly predicting log likelihood ratios (LLRs) from the received in phase and quadrature phase (IQ) signals. The first network, the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), employs a state of the art (SOTA) transformer architecture with an attention mechanism. The second network, the Residual Dual Non Local Attention Network (RDNLA), utilizes a parallel residual architecture with a non local attention block. The bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) performance of various SOTA neural receiver architectures is compared with our proposed methods across different signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels. The simulation results show that DAT and RDNLA outperform both traditional communication systems and existing neural receiver models. The computational efficiency of the proposed neural receivers supports their feasibility for next generation communication systems.

arXiv:2503.24235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As enthusiasm for scaling computation (data and parameters) in the pretraining era gradually diminished, test-time scaling (TTS), also referred to as ``test-time computing'' has emerged as a prominent research focus. Recent studies demonstrate that TTS can further elicit the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling significant breakthroughs not only in specialized reasoning tasks, such as mathematics and coding, but also in general tasks like open-ended Q&amp;A. However, despite the explosion of recent efforts in this area, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive survey offering a systemic understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a unified, multidimensional framework structured along four core dimensions of TTS research: what to scale, how to scale, where to scale, and how well to scale. Building upon this taxonomy, we conduct an extensive review of methods, application scenarios, and assessment aspects, and present an organized decomposition that highlights the unique functional roles of individual techniques within the broader TTS landscape. From this analysis, we distill the major developmental trajectories of TTS to date and offer hands-on guidelines for practical deployment. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges and offer insights into promising future directions, including further scaling, clarifying the functional essence of techniques, generalizing to more tasks, and more attributions.

arXiv:2504.03302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce inaccurate or misleading content-hallucinations. To address this challenge, we introduce Noise-Augmented Fine-Tuning (NoiseFiT), a novel framework that leverages adaptive noise injection based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to enhance model robustness. In particular, NoiseFiT selectively perturbs layers identified as either high-SNR (more robust) or low-SNR (potentially under-regularized) using a dynamically scaled Gaussian noise. We further propose a hybrid loss that combines standard cross-entropy, soft cross-entropy, and consistency regularization to ensure stable and accurate outputs under noisy training conditions. Our theoretical analysis shows that adaptive noise injection is both unbiased and variance-preserving, providing strong guarantees for convergence in expectation. Empirical results on multiple test and benchmark datasets demonstrate that NoiseFiT significantly reduces hallucination rates, often improving or matching baseline performance in key tasks. These findings highlight the promise of noise-driven strategies for achieving robust, trustworthy language modeling without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Given the comprehensive and detailed nature of our experiments, we have publicly released the fine-tuning logs, benchmark evaluation artifacts, and source code online at W&amp;B, Hugging Face, and GitHub, respectively, to foster further research, accessibility and reproducibility.

Abstract: Training effective AI agents for multi-turn interactions requires high-quality data that captures realistic human-agent dynamics, yet such data is scarce and expensive to collect manually. We introduce APIGen-MT, a two-phase framework that generates verifiable and diverse multi-turn agent data. In the first phase, our agentic pipeline produces detailed task blueprints with ground-truth actions, leveraging a committee of LLM reviewers and iterative feedback loops. These blueprints are then transformed into complete interaction trajectories through simulated human-agent interplay. We train a family of models -- the xLAM-2-fc-r series with sizes ranging from 1B to 70B parameters. Our models outperform frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 on $\tau$-bench and BFCL benchmarks, with the smaller models surpassing their larger counterparts, particularly in multi-turn settings, while maintaining superior consistency across multiple trials. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our verified blueprint-to-details approach yields high-quality training data, enabling the development of more reliable, efficient, and capable agents. We open-source 5K synthetic data trajectories and the trained xLAM-2-fc-r models to advance research in AI agents.

Abstract: Consider a setting where a pre-trained agent is operating in an environment and a human operator can decide to temporarily terminate its operation and take-over for some duration of time. These kind of scenarios are common in human-machine interactions, for example in autonomous driving, factory automation and healthcare. In these settings, we typically observe a trade-off between two extreme cases -- if no take-overs are allowed, then the agent might employ a sub-optimal, possibly dangerous policy. Alternatively, if there are too many take-overs, then the human has no confidence in the agent, greatly limiting its usefulness. In this paper, we formalize this setup and propose an explainability scheme to help optimize the number of human interventions.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic, provides a standardized framework for artificial intelligence (AI) systems to interact with external data sources and tools in real-time. While MCP offers significant advantages for AI integration and capability extension, it introduces novel security challenges that demand rigorous analysis and mitigation. This paper builds upon foundational research into MCP architecture and preliminary security assessments to deliver enterprise-grade mitigation frameworks and detailed technical implementation strategies. Through systematic threat modeling and analysis of MCP implementations and analysis of potential attack vectors, including sophisticated threats like tool poisoning, we present actionable security patterns tailored for MCP implementers and adopters. The primary contribution of this research lies in translating theoretical security concerns into a practical, implementable framework with actionable controls, thereby providing essential guidance for the secure enterprise adoption and governance of integrated AI systems.

Abstract: This technical report presents a cost-efficient strategy for training a video generation foundation model. We present a mid-sized research model with approximately 7 billion parameters (7B) called Seaweed-7B trained from scratch using 665,000 H100 GPU hours. Despite being trained with moderate computational resources, Seaweed-7B demonstrates highly competitive performance compared to contemporary video generation models of much larger size. Design choices are especially crucial in a resource-constrained setting. This technical report highlights the key design decisions that enhance the performance of the medium-sized diffusion model. Empirically, we make two observations: (1) Seaweed-7B achieves performance comparable to, or even surpasses, larger models trained on substantially greater GPU resources, and (2) our model, which exhibits strong generalization ability, can be effectively adapted across a wide range of downstream applications either by lightweight fine-tuning or continue training.

Abstract: Recently, slow-thinking systems like GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated great potential in solving challenging problems through explicit reflection. They significantly outperform the best fast-thinking models, such as GPT-4o, on various math and science benchmarks. However, their multimodal reasoning capabilities remain on par with fast-thinking models. For instance, GPT-o1's performance on benchmarks like MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision is similar to fast-thinking models. In this paper, we aim to enhance the slow-thinking capabilities of vision-language models using reinforcement learning (without relying on distillation) to advance the state of the art. First, we adapt the GRPO algorithm with a novel technique called Selective Sample Replay (SSR) to address the vanishing advantages problem. While this approach yields strong performance, the resulting RL-trained models exhibit limited self-reflection or self-verification. To further encourage slow-thinking, we introduce Forced Rethinking, which appends a rethinking trigger token to the end of rollouts in RL training, explicitly enforcing a self-reflection reasoning step. By combining these two techniques, our model, VL-Rethinker, advances state-of-the-art scores on MathVista, MathVerse to achieve 80.4%, 63.5% respectively. VL-Rethinker also achieves open-source SoTA on multi-disciplinary benchmarks such as MathVision, MMMU-Pro, EMMA, and MEGA-Bench, narrowing the gap with OpenAI-o1. Our empirical results show the effectiveness of our approaches.

<title>Better Estimation of the KL Divergence Between Language Models</title>

Abstract: Estimating the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence between language models has many applications, e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), interpretability, and knowledge distillation. However, computing the exact KL divergence between two arbitrary language models is intractable. Thus, practitioners often resort to the use of sampling-based estimators. While it is easy to fashion a simple Monte Carlo (MC) estimator that provides an unbiased estimate of the KL divergence between language models, this estimator notoriously suffers from high variance, and can even result in a negative estimate of the KL divergence, a non-negative quantity. In this paper, we introduce a Rao--Blackwellized estimator that is also unbiased and provably has variance less than or equal to that of the standard Monte Carlo estimator. In an empirical study on sentiment-controlled fine-tuning, we show that our estimator provides more stable KL estimates and reduces variance substantially in practice. Additionally, we derive an analogous Rao--Blackwellized estimator of the gradient of the KL divergence, which leads to more stable training and produces models that more frequently appear on the Pareto frontier of reward vs. KL compared to the ones trained with the MC estimator of the gradient.

Abstract: The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater improvements in the few NFEs regime.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language multimodal models (LMMs) for video have demonstrated their potential for understanding video content, yet the task of comprehending multi-discipline lectures remains largely unexplored. We introduce Video-MMLU, a massive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of LMMs in understanding Multi-Discipline Lectures. We evaluate over 90 open-source and proprietary models, ranging from 0.5B to 40B parameters. Our results highlight the limitations of current models in addressing the cognitive challenges presented by these lectures, especially in tasks requiring both perception and reasoning. Additionally, we explore how the number of visual tokens and the large language models influence performance, offering insights into the interplay between multimodal perception and reasoning in lecture comprehension.

Abstract: Code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential tools in modern software development, enhancing productivity and accelerating development. This paper aims to investigate the fine-tuning of code-generating LLMs using Reinforcement Learning and Direct Preference Optimization, further improving their performance. To achieve this, we enhance the training data for the reward model with the help of symbolic execution techniques, ensuring more comprehensive and objective data. With symbolic execution, we create a custom dataset that better captures the nuances in code evaluation. Our reward models, fine-tuned on this dataset, demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline, CodeRL, in estimating the quality of generated code. Our code-generating LLMs, trained with the help of reward model feedback, achieve similar results compared to the CodeRL benchmark.

<title>FairTranslate: An English-French Dataset for Gender Bias Evaluation in Machine Translation by Overcoming Gender Binarity</title>

arXiv:2504.15941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly leveraged for translation tasks but often fall short when translating inclusive language -- such as texts containing the singular 'they' pronoun or otherwise reflecting fair linguistic protocols. Because these challenges span both computational and societal domains, it is imperative to critically evaluate how well LLMs handle inclusive translation with a well-founded framework.
  This paper presents FairTranslate, a novel, fully human-annotated dataset designed to evaluate non-binary gender biases in machine translation systems from English to French. FairTranslate includes 2418 English-French sentence pairs related to occupations, annotated with rich metadata such as the stereotypical alignment of the occupation, grammatical gender indicator ambiguity, and the ground-truth gender label (male, female, or inclusive).
  We evaluate four leading LLMs (Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B, Llama3.1-8B, Llama3.3-70B) on this dataset under different prompting procedures. Our results reveal substantial biases in gender representation across LLMs, highlighting persistent challenges in achieving equitable outcomes in machine translation. These findings underscore the need for focused strategies and interventions aimed at ensuring fair and inclusive language usage in LLM-based translation systems.
  We make the FairTranslate dataset publicly available on Hugging Face, and disclose the code for all experiments on GitHub.

arXiv:2504.16902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Agentic AI systems evolve from basic workflows to complex multi agent collaboration, robust protocols such as Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) become essential enablers. To foster secure adoption and ensure the reliability of these complex interactions, understanding the secure implementation of A2A is essential. This paper addresses this goal by providing a comprehensive security analysis centered on the A2A protocol. We examine its fundamental elements and operational dynamics, situating it within the framework of agent communication development. Utilizing the MAESTRO framework, specifically designed for AI risks, we apply proactive threat modeling to assess potential security issues in A2A deployments, focusing on aspects such as Agent Card management, task execution integrity, and authentication methodologies.
  Based on these insights, we recommend practical secure development methodologies and architectural best practices designed to build resilient and effective A2A systems. Our analysis also explores how the synergy between A2A and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) can further enhance secure interoperability. This paper equips developers and architects with the knowledge and practical guidance needed to confidently leverage the A2A protocol for building robust and secure next generation agentic applications.

<title>Neural operators struggle to learn complex PDEs in pedestrian mobility: Hughes model case study</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18267</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.18267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of neural operators in learning solutions for a Hughes model, a first-order hyperbolic conservation law system for crowd dynamics. The model couples a Fokker-Planck equation representing pedestrian density with a Hamilton-Jacobi-type (eikonal) equation. This Hughes model belongs to the class of nonlinear hyperbolic systems that often exhibit complex solution structures, including shocks and discontinuities. In this study, we assess the performance of three state-of-the-art neural operators (Fourier Neural Operator, Wavelet Neural Operator, and Multiwavelet Neural Operator) in various challenging scenarios. Specifically, we consider (1) discontinuous and Gaussian initial conditions and (2) diverse boundary conditions, while also examining the impact of different numerical schemes.
  Our results show that these neural operators perform well in easy scenarios with fewer discontinuities in the initial condition, yet they struggle in complex scenarios with multiple initial discontinuities and dynamic boundary conditions, even when trained specifically on such complex samples. The predicted solutions often appear smoother, resulting in a reduction in total variation and a loss of important physical features. This smoothing behavior is similar to issues discussed by Daganzo (1995), where models that introduce artificial diffusion were shown to miss essential features such as shock waves in hyperbolic systems. These results suggest that current neural operator architectures may introduce unintended regularization effects that limit their ability to capture transport dynamics governed by discontinuities. They also raise concerns about generalizing these methods to traffic applications where shock preservation is essential.

Summary:
ROSA is a knowledge-based framework designed for RObot Self-Adaptation, allowing for task-and-architecture co-adaptation in robotic systems. It utilizes a knowledge model to capture application-specific information needed for adaptation and reasons over this data at runtime to determine when and how adaptation should take place.

Abstract: Autonomous robots must operate in diverse environments and handle multiple tasks despite uncertainties. This creates challenges in designing software architectures and task decision-making algorithms, as different contexts may require distinct task logic and architectural configurations. To address this, robotic systems can be designed as self-adaptive systems capable of adapting their task execution and software architecture at runtime based on their context.This paper introduces ROSA, a novel knowledge-based framework for RObot Self-Adaptation, which enables task-and-architecture co-adaptation (TACA) in robotic systems. ROSA achieves this by providing a knowledge model that captures all application-specific knowledge required for adaptation and by reasoning over this knowledge at runtime to determine when and how adaptation should occur. In addition to a conceptual framework, this work provides an open-source ROS 2-based reference implementation of ROSA and evaluates its feasibility and performance in an underwater robotics application. Experimental results highlight ROSA's advantages in reusability and development effort for designing self-adaptive robotic systems.

Abstract: Howard's Policy Iteration (HPI) is a classic algorithm for solving Markov Decision Problems (MDPs). HPI uses a "greedy" switching rule to update from any non-optimal policy to a dominating one, iterating until an optimal policy is found. Despite its introduction over 60 years ago, the best-known upper bounds on HPI's running time remain exponential in the number of states -- indeed even on the restricted class of MDPs with only deterministic transitions (DMDPs). Meanwhile, the tightest lower bound for HPI for MDPs with a constant number of actions per state is only linear. In this paper, we report a significant improvement: a subexponential upper bound for HPI on DMDPs, which is parameterised by the bit-size of the rewards, while independent of the discount factor. The same upper bound also applies to DMDPs with only two possible rewards (which may be of arbitrary size).

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in areas that significantly impact human lives, concerns about fairness and transparency have grown, especially regarding their impact on protected groups. Recently, the intersection of explainability and fairness has emerged as an important area to promote responsible AI systems. This paper explores how explainability methods can be leveraged to detect and interpret unfairness. We propose a pipeline that integrates local post-hoc explanation methods to derive fairness-related insights. During the pipeline design, we identify and address critical questions arising from the use of explanations as bias detectors such as the relationship between distributive and procedural fairness, the effect of removing the protected attribute, the consistency and quality of results across different explanation methods, the impact of various aggregation strategies of local explanations on group fairness evaluations, and the overall trustworthiness of explanations as bias detectors. Our results show the potential of explanation methods used for fairness while highlighting the need to carefully consider the aforementioned critical aspects.

Summary: 
Clinical risk prediction in healthcare relies on high-quality time series clinical event data. The MIMIC-\RNum{4}-Ext-22MCTS dataset, containing 22,588,586 clinical events extracted from discharge summaries of MIMIC-IV-Note, addresses challenges of lengthy summaries and missing timestamps. A framework is proposed to break down summaries, retrieve relevant chunks using contextual search, and teach Llama-3.1-8B model to identify temporal information. Models fine-tuned on this dataset show significant improvements, with a BERT model achieving 10% accuracy increase in medical question answering and 3% in clinical trial matching tasks compared to classic BERT. GPT-2 also produces more reliable clinical results for questions when fine-tuned on this dataset.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical risk prediction based on machine learning algorithms plays a vital role in modern healthcare. A crucial component in developing a reliable prediction model is collecting high-quality time series clinical events. In this work, we release such a dataset that consists of 22,588,586 Clinical Time Series events, which we term MIMIC-\RNum{4}-Ext-22MCTS. Our source data are discharge summaries selected from the well-known yet unstructured MIMIC-IV-Note \cite{Johnson2023-pg}. We then extract clinical events as short text span from the discharge summaries, along with the timestamps of these events as temporal information. The general-purpose MIMIC-IV-Note pose specific challenges for our work: it turns out that the discharge summaries are too lengthy for typical natural language models to process, and the clinical events of interest often are not accompanied with explicit timestamps. Therefore, we propose a new framework that works as follows: 1) we break each discharge summary into manageably small text chunks; 2) we apply contextual BM25 and contextual semantic search to retrieve chunks that have a high potential of containing clinical events; and 3) we carefully design prompts to teach the recently released Llama-3.1-8B \cite{touvron2023llama} model to identify or infer temporal information of the chunks. We show that the obtained dataset is so informative and transparent that standard models fine-tuned on our dataset are achieving significant improvements in healthcare applications. In particular, the BERT model fine-tuned based on our dataset achieves 10\% improvement in accuracy on medical question answering task, and 3\% improvement in clinical trial matching task compared with the classic BERT. The GPT-2 model, fine-tuned on our dataset, produces more clinically reliable results for clinical questions.

Summary: 
Agentic pipelines, involving multiple LLMs with minimal human control, pose challenges for human-centered explainability. The HCXAI community is exploring ways to make the inner workings of LLMs more transparent and actionable. A perceptive task guidance system implemented in an agentic pipeline was studied, revealing that CoT reasoning, often used for explainability in LLMs, did not consistently improve outputs or offer meaningful explanations. The study found that CoT reasoning alone did not enhance user understanding or goal achievement. This research highlights the complexity of achieving explainability in agentic pipelines and the limitations of relying solely on CoT reasoning for this purpose. <div>

Abstract: Agentic pipelines present novel challenges and opportunities for human-centered explainability. The HCXAI community is still grappling with how best to make the inner workings of LLMs transparent in actionable ways. Agentic pipelines consist of multiple LLMs working in cooperation with minimal human control. In this research paper, we present early findings from an agentic pipeline implementation of a perceptive task guidance system. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we analyze how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, a common vehicle for explainability in LLMs, operates within agentic pipelines. We demonstrate that CoT reasoning alone does not lead to better outputs, nor does it offer explainability, as it tends to produce explanations without explainability, in that they do not improve the ability of end users to better understand systems or achieve their goals.

Abstract: Driver assistance systems provide a wide range of crucial services, including closely monitoring the condition of vehicles. This paper showcases a groundbreaking sensor health monitoring system designed for the automotive industry. The ingenious system leverages cutting-edge techniques to process data collected from various vehicle sensors. It compares their outputs within the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to evaluate the health of each sensor. To unravel the intricate correlations between sensor data, an extensive exploration of machine learning and deep learning methodologies was conducted. Through meticulous analysis, the most correlated sensor data were identified. These valuable insights were then utilized to provide accurate estimations of sensor values. Among the diverse learning methods examined, the combination of autoencoders for detecting sensor failures and random forest regression for estimating sensor values proved to yield the most impressive outcomes. A statistical model using the normal distribution has been developed to identify possible sensor failures proactively. By comparing the actual values of the sensors with their estimated values based on correlated sensors, faulty sensors can be detected early. When a defective sensor is detected, both the driver and the maintenance department are promptly alerted. Additionally, the system replaces the value of the faulty sensor with the estimated value obtained through analysis. This proactive approach was evaluated using data from twenty essential sensors in the Saipa's Quick vehicle's ECU, resulting in an impressive accuracy rate of 99\%.

Summary:
The paper introduces an online framework using a large language model (LLM) for generating safety-critical driving scenarios to test autonomous vehicles. It first uses an LLM-based behavior analyzer to infer dangerous intents of background vehicles and then queries additional LLM agents to create adversarial trajectories.

arXiv:2505.00972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based testing is crucial for validating autonomous vehicles (AVs), yet existing scenario generation methods either overfit to common driving patterns or operate in an offline, non-interactive manner that fails to expose rare, safety-critical corner cases. In this paper, we introduce an online, retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework for generating safety-critical driving scenarios. Our method first employs an LLM-based behavior analyzer to infer the most dangerous intent of the background vehicle from the observed state, then queries additional LLM agents to synthesize feasible adversarial trajectories. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting and accelerate adaptation, we augment the framework with a dynamic memorization and retrieval bank of intent-planner pairs, automatically expanding its behavioral library when novel intents arise. Evaluations using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our model reduces the mean minimum time-to-collision from 1.62 to 1.08 s and incurs a 75% collision rate, substantially outperforming baselines.

<div> signals, planning capability, in-context learning, exemplars, performance improvement

Summary:
This article discusses the use of in-context learning to improve the planning capability of large language models (LLMs). The study explores how signal selection can impact model performance, with a focus on filtering exemplars based on action sequence similarity. A two-stage pipeline, GRASE-DC, is proposed to re-sample and curate exemplars for improved planning accuracy. Experimental results show significant performance enhancements on various planning tasks, with up to 40 point absolute accuracy improvement and reduced exemplar usage. GRASE-DC* + VAL, incorporating a validator, further boosts performance by 18.9%. Analysis confirms consistent performance gains across different LLMs and planning benchmarks. Notably, using simpler problems as exemplars can improve planning accuracy on more challenging tasks, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize to new problems. <div>

Abstract: Planning is essential for artificial intelligence systems to look ahead and proactively determine a course of actions to reach objectives in the virtual and real world. Recent work on large language models (LLMs) sheds light on their planning capability in various tasks. However, it remains unclear what signals in the context influence the model performance. In this work, we explore how to improve the model planning capability through in-context learning (ICL), specifically, what signals can help select the exemplars. Through extensive experiments, we observe that commonly used problem similarity may result in false positives with drastically different plans, which can mislead the model. In response, we propose to sample and filter exemplars leveraging plan side action sequence similarity (AS). We propose GRASE-DC: a two-stage pipeline that first re-samples high AS exemplars and then curates the selected exemplars with dynamic clustering on AS to achieve a balance of relevance and diversity. Our experimental result confirms that GRASE-DC achieves significant performance improvement on various planning tasks (up to ~11-40 point absolute accuracy improvement with 27.3% fewer exemplars needed on average). With GRASE-DC* + VAL, where we iteratively apply GRASE-DC with a validator, we are able to even boost the performance by 18.9% more.
  Extensive analysis validates the consistent performance improvement of GRASE-DC with various backbone LLMs and on both classical planning and natural language planning benchmarks. GRASE-DC can further boost the planning accuracy by ~24 absolute points on harder problems using simpler problems as exemplars over a random baseline. This demonstrates its ability to generalize to out-of-distribution problems.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses security vulnerabilities in Windows Active Directory systems. It introduces an Adaptive Path Removal Problem to optimize the process of removing edges from attack paths. The problem aims to minimize the number of interactions between security teams and IT admins. The article proves the problem's complexity and proposes solutions including exact, approximate, and heuristic algorithms. The best heuristic, called DPR, is shown to be effective on larger-scale graphs and outperforms the approximate algorithm. The algorithms' effectiveness is verified on synthetic AD graphs and an attack graph from a real organization. <div>

Abstract: Security vulnerabilities in Windows Active Directory (AD) systems are typically modeled using an attack graph and hardening AD systems involves an iterative workflow: security teams propose an edge to remove, and IT operations teams manually review these fixes before implementing the removal. As verification requires significant manual effort, we formulate an Adaptive Path Removal Problem to minimize the number of steps in this iterative removal process. In our model, a wizard proposes an attack path in each step and presents it as a set of multiple-choice options to the IT admin. The IT admin then selects one edge from the proposed set to remove. This process continues until the target $t$ is disconnected from source $s$ or the number of proposed paths reaches $B$. The model aims to optimize the human effort by minimizing the expected number of interactions between the IT admin and the security wizard. We first prove that the problem is $\mathcal{\#P}$-hard. We then propose a set of solutions including an exact algorithm, an approximate algorithm, and several scalable heuristics. Our best heuristic, called DPR, can operate effectively on larger-scale graphs compared to the exact algorithm and consistently outperforms the approximate algorithm across all graphs. We verify the effectiveness of our algorithms on several synthetic AD graphs and an AD attack graph collected from a real organization.

Summary:
Retrial-Augmented Learning (RAL) introduces a reward-free self-supervised learning framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that avoids the need for model training. By incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as an intermediate data organization module, RAL facilitates a three-stage autonomous knowledge generation process: hypothesis generation, hypothesis validation, and knowledge generation. Through evaluation in the LLM-PySC2 environment, known for its complex decision-making requirements, RAL proves effective in reducing hallucination and improving decision-making performance at a minimal cost. The method also shows promise in out-of-distribution tasks, demonstrating robustness and transferability. Overall, RAL offers a cost-effective solution for decision-making challenges and autonomous knowledge generation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The lack of domain-specific data in the pre-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) severely limits LLM-based decision systems in specialized applications, while post-training a model in the scenarios requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we present Retrial-Augmented Learning (RAL), a reward-free self-supervised learning framework for LLMs that operates without model training. By developing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into a module for organizing intermediate data, we realized a three-stage autonomous knowledge generation of proposing a hypothesis, validating the hypothesis, and generating the knowledge. The method is evaluated in the LLM-PySC2 environment, a representative decision-making platform that combines sufficient complexity with domain-specific knowledge requirements. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces hallucination by generating and utilizing validated knowledge, and increases decision-making performance at an extremely low cost. Meanwhile, the approach exhibits potential in out-of-distribution(OOD) tasks, robustness, and transferability, making it a cost-friendly but effective solution for decision-making problems and autonomous knowledge generation.

<div> Keywords: Swarming systems, data poisoning attacks, explainable AI methods, evolutionary intelligence, cooperative tasks<br />
Summary:<br />
Swarming systems, such as multi-drone networks, are efficient at cooperative tasks but susceptible to data poisoning attacks. A new framework using explainable AI methods investigates the effects of such attacks on team-level coordination. The framework models agent interaction through evolutionary intelligence, leading to the emergence of an optimal coalition for coordinated tasks. Rigorous evaluation shows that data manipulation attacks can disrupt team strategy, with non-optimal strategies leading to inefficient cooperation when poisoning exceeds 10%. Explainable AI methods are applied to quantify the effects of poisoning and extract footprint characterizations for diagnosis. This research highlights the importance of understanding and detecting data poisoning attacks in swarming systems to ensure effective and robust coordination among autonomous agents. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.01181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swarming systems, such as for example multi-drone networks, excel at cooperative tasks like monitoring, surveillance, or disaster assistance in critical environments, where autonomous agents make decentralized decisions in order to fulfill team-level objectives in a robust and efficient manner. Unfortunately, team-level coordinated strategies in the wild are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, resulting in either inaccurate coordination or adversarial behavior among the agents. To address this challenge, we contribute a framework that investigates the effects of such data poisoning attacks, using explainable AI methods. We model the interaction among agents using evolutionary intelligence, where an optimal coalition strategically emerges to perform coordinated tasks. Then, through a rigorous evaluation, the swarm model is systematically poisoned using data manipulation attacks. We showcase the applicability of explainable AI methods to quantify the effects of poisoning on the team strategy and extract footprint characterizations that enable diagnosing. Our findings indicate that when the model is poisoned above 10%, non-optimal strategies resulting in inefficient cooperation can be identified.

Summary: <br />
This study explores the impact of different types of explanations provided by AI systems, as well as the influence of individual personality traits, specifically the Need for Cognition (NFC), on decision-making accuracy, reliance on AI, and cognitive load. The research found that high AI confidence increased reliance on AI and reduced cognitive load. While feature-based explanations did not significantly improve accuracy, counterfactual explanations, despite being less understandable, enhanced overall accuracy. Both low and high NFC individuals prioritized explanations over AI information, suggesting the importance of personalized XAI interfaces. Surprisingly, there were no significant differences in decision-making accuracy or cognitive load between low and high NFC groups, indicating the need for further investigation into the role of personality traits in AI-assisted decision-making. These findings emphasize the importance of user-centric design in XAI interfaces and the potential benefits of incorporating varied explanation styles to optimize human-AI collaboration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly used for decision-making across domains, raising debates over the information and explanations they should provide. Most research on Explainable AI (XAI) has focused on feature-based explanations, with less attention on alternative styles. Personality traits like the Need for Cognition (NFC) can also lead to different decision-making outcomes among low and high NFC individuals. We investigated how presenting AI information (prediction, confidence, and accuracy) and different explanation styles (example-based, feature-based, rule-based, and counterfactual) affect accuracy, reliance on AI, and cognitive load in a loan application scenario. We also examined low and high NFC individuals' differences in prioritizing XAI interface elements (loan attributes, AI information, and explanations), accuracy, and cognitive load. Our findings show that high AI confidence significantly increases reliance on AI while reducing cognitive load. Feature-based explanations did not enhance accuracy compared to other conditions. Although counterfactual explanations were less understandable, they enhanced overall accuracy, increasing reliance on AI and reducing cognitive load when AI predictions were correct. Both low and high NFC individuals prioritized explanations after loan attributes, leaving AI information as the least important. However, we found no significant differences between low and high NFC groups in accuracy or cognitive load, raising questions about the role of personality traits in AI-assisted decision-making. These findings highlight the need for user-centric personalization in XAI interfaces, incorporating diverse explanation styles and exploring multiple personality traits and other user characteristics to optimize human-AI collaboration.

Summary:
TARL is a novel approach that utilizes shapelet dynamics in heart rate time series to model illness progression and predict future changes. By creating a shapelet-transition knowledge graph and implementing a transition-aware knowledge embedding, TARL effectively handles missing values in wearable device data and provides comprehensive representations of heart rate patterns. In collaboration with healthcare professionals, TARL was evaluated using real-world ICU patient data, demonstrating high reliability and early detection capability.

Abstract: Early detection of patient deterioration is crucial for reducing mortality rates. Heart rate data has shown promise in assessing patient health, and wearable devices offer a cost-effective solution for real-time monitoring. However, extracting meaningful insights from diverse heart rate data and handling missing values in wearable device data remain key challenges. To address these challenges, we propose TARL, an innovative approach that models the structural relationships of representative subsequences, known as shapelets, in heart rate time series. TARL creates a shapelet-transition knowledge graph to model shapelet dynamics in heart rate time series, indicating illness progression and potential future changes. We further introduce a transition-aware knowledge embedding to reinforce relationships among shapelets and quantify the impact of missing values, enabling the formulation of comprehensive heart rate representations. These representations capture explanatory structures and predict future heart rate trends, aiding early illness detection. We collaborate with physicians and nurses to gather ICU patient heart rate data from wearables and diagnostic metrics assessing illness severity for evaluating deterioration. Experiments on real-world ICU data demonstrate that TARL achieves both high reliability and early detection. A case study further showcases TARL's explainable detection process, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven tool to assist clinicians in recognizing early signs of patient deterioration.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large multi-modal models inevitably decay over time as facts change and previously learned information becomes outdated. Traditional approaches such as fine-tuning are often impractical for updating these models due to their size and complexity. Instead, direct knowledge editing within the models presents a more viable solution. Current model editing techniques, however, typically overlook the unique influence ranges of different facts, leading to compromised model performance in terms of both generality and locality. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of the generality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. We develop a new model editing dataset named OKEDIT, specifically designed to effectively evaluate this trade-off. Building on this foundation, we propose BalancEdit, a novel method for balanced model editing that dynamically achieves an optimal balance between generality and locality. BalancEdit utilizes a unique mechanism that generates both positive and negative samples for each fact to accurately determine its influence scope and incorporates these insights into the model's latent space using a discrete, localized codebook of edits, without modifying the underlying model weights. To our knowledge, this is the first approach explicitly addressing the generality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. Our comprehensive results confirm the effectiveness of BalancEdit, demonstrating minimal trade-offs while maintaining robust editing capabilities. Our code and dataset will be available.

Abstract: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is fundamental for advanced software development, supporting faster and more efficient delivery of code changes into cloud environments. However, security issues in the CI/CD pipeline remain challenging, and incidents (e.g., DDoS, Bot, Log4j, etc.) are happening over the cloud environments. While plenty of literature discusses static security testing and CI/CD practices, only a few deal with network traffic pattern analysis to detect different cyberattacks. This research aims to enhance CI/CD pipeline security by implementing anomaly detection through AI (Artificial Intelligence) support. The goal is to identify unusual behaviour or variations from network traffic patterns in pipeline and cloud platforms. The system shall integrate into the workflow to continuously monitor pipeline activities and cloud infrastructure. Additionally, it aims to explore adaptive response mechanisms to mitigate the detected anomalies or security threats. This research employed two popular network traffic datasets, CSE-CIC-IDS2018 and CSE-CIC-IDS2017. We implemented a combination of Convolution Neural Network(CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to detect unusual traffic patterns. We achieved an accuracy of 98.69% and 98.30% and generated log files in different CI/CD pipeline stages that resemble the network anomalies affected to address security challenges in modern DevOps practices, contributing to advancing software security and reliability.

Abstract: Moral stories are a time-tested vehicle for transmitting values, yet modern NLP lacks a large, structured corpus that couples coherent narratives with explicit ethical lessons. We close this gap with TF1-EN-3M, the first open dataset of three million English-language fables generated exclusively by instruction-tuned models no larger than 8B parameters. Each story follows a six-slot scaffold (character -> trait -> setting -> conflict -> resolution -> moral), produced through a combinatorial prompt engine that guarantees genre fidelity while covering a broad thematic space.
  A hybrid evaluation pipeline blends (i) a GPT-based critic that scores grammar, creativity, moral clarity, and template adherence with (ii) reference-free diversity and readability metrics. Among ten open-weight candidates, an 8B-parameter Llama-3 variant delivers the best quality-speed trade-off, producing high-scoring fables on a single consumer GPU (<24 GB VRAM) at approximately 13.5 cents per 1,000 fables.
  We release the dataset, generation code, evaluation scripts, and full metadata under a permissive license, enabling exact reproducibility and cost benchmarking. TF1-EN-3M opens avenues for research in instruction following, narrative intelligence, value alignment, and child-friendly educational AI, demonstrating that large-scale moral storytelling no longer requires proprietary giant models.

Abstract: Plant phenotyping plays a pivotal role in understanding plant traits and their interactions with the environment, making it crucial for advancing precision agriculture and crop improvement. 3D reconstruction technologies have emerged as powerful tools for capturing detailed plant morphology and structure, offering significant potential for accurate and automated phenotyping. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the 3D reconstruction techniques for plant phenotyping, covering classical reconstruction methods, emerging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and the novel 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) approach. Classical methods, which often rely on high-resolution sensors, are widely adopted due to their simplicity and flexibility in representing plant structures. However, they face challenges such as data density, noise, and scalability. NeRF, a recent advancement, enables high-quality, photorealistic 3D reconstructions from sparse viewpoints, but its computational cost and applicability in outdoor environments remain areas of active research. The emerging 3DGS technique introduces a new paradigm in reconstructing plant structures by representing geometry through Gaussian primitives, offering potential benefits in both efficiency and scalability. We review the methodologies, applications, and performance of these approaches in plant phenotyping and discuss their respective strengths, limitations, and future prospects (https://github.com/JiajiaLi04/3D-Reconstruction-Plants). Through this review, we aim to provide insights into how these diverse 3D reconstruction techniques can be effectively leveraged for automated and high-throughput plant phenotyping, contributing to the next generation of agricultural technology.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have broadened the scope of vision-language tasks, excelling in applications like image captioning and interactive question-answering. However, these models struggle with accurately processing visual data, particularly in tasks requiring precise object recognition and fine visual details. Stringent token limits often result in the omission of critical information, hampering performance. To address these limitations, we introduce \SysName, a novel visual prompting mechanism designed to enhance MLLM performance while preserving essential visual details within token limits. \SysName features three key innovations: a prompt-aware strategy that dynamically highlights relevant image regions, a spatial-preserving orchestration schema that maintains object integrity, and a budget-aware prompting method that balances global context with crucial visual details. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate that \SysName consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving up to a $26.9\%$ improvement in accuracy while significantly reducing token consumption.

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking presents significant challenges due to extreme illumination variations and viewpoint changes, which severely degrade tracking performance. Existing approaches either rely on light enhancers with high computational costs or introduce redundant domain adaptation mechanisms, failing to fully utilize the dynamic features in varying perspectives. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DARTer} (\textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}epresentation \textbf{T}racker), an end-to-end tracking framework designed for nighttime UAV scenarios. DARTer leverages a Dynamic Feature Blender (DFB) to effectively fuse multi-perspective nighttime features from static and dynamic templates, enhancing representation robustness. Meanwhile, a Dynamic Feature Activator (DFA) adaptively activates Vision Transformer layers based on extracted features, significantly improving efficiency by reducing redundant computations. Our model eliminates the need for complex multi-task loss functions, enabling a streamlined training process. Extensive experiments on multiple nighttime UAV tracking benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DARTer over state-of-the-art trackers. These results confirm that DARTer effectively balances tracking accuracy and efficiency, making it a promising solution for real-world nighttime UAV tracking applications.

Abstract: This work presents P2P-Insole, a low-cost approach for estimating and visualizing 3D human skeletal data using insole-type sensors integrated with IMUs. Each insole, fabricated with e-textile garment techniques, costs under USD 1, making it significantly cheaper than commercial alternatives and ideal for large-scale production. Our approach uses foot pressure distribution, acceleration, and rotation data to overcome limitations, providing a lightweight, minimally intrusive, and privacy-aware solution. The system employs a Transformer model for efficient temporal feature extraction, enriched by first and second derivatives in the input stream. Including multimodal information, such as accelerometers and rotational measurements, improves the accuracy of complex motion pattern recognition. These facts are demonstrated experimentally, while error metrics show the robustness of the approach in various posture estimation tasks. This work could be the foundation for a low-cost, practical application in rehabilitation, injury prevention, and health monitoring while enabling further development through sensor optimization and expanded datasets.

Abstract: 4D radar has attracted attention in autonomous driving due to its ability to enable robust 3D object detection even under adverse weather conditions. To practically deploy such technologies, it is essential to achieve real-time processing within low-power embedded environments. Addressing this, we present the first on-chip implementation of a 4D radar-based 3D object detection model on the Hailo-8L AI accelerator. Although conventional 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures require 5D inputs, the Hailo-8L only supports 4D tensors, posing a significant challenge. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a tensor transformation method that reshapes 5D inputs into 4D formats during the compilation process, enabling direct deployment without altering the model structure. The proposed system achieves 46.47% AP_3D and 52.75% AP_BEV, maintaining comparable accuracy to GPU-based models while achieving an inference speed of 13.76 Hz. These results demonstrate the applicability of 4D radar-based perception technologies to autonomous driving systems.

Summary: <br />
The paper explores using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as evaluator agents for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. They introduce the Multimodal Text-to-Image Eval (MT2IE) framework to evaluate prompt-generation consistency and image aesthetics efficiently. MT2IE generates prompts iteratively, scoring the generated images and matching T2I performance with existing benchmarks using a fraction of prompts. The prompt-generation consistency scores from MT2IE show higher correlation with human judgment compared to previous methods. The framework produces the same relative T2I model rankings as static benchmarks but uses significantly fewer prompts for evaluation, showcasing its efficiency in evaluating T2I models. <div>

Abstract: The steady improvements of text-to-image (T2I) generative models lead to slow deprecation of automatic evaluation benchmarks that rely on static datasets, motivating researchers to seek alternative ways to evaluate the T2I progress. In this paper, we explore the potential of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as evaluator agents that interact with a T2I model, with the objective of assessing prompt-generation consistency and image aesthetics. We present Multimodal Text-to-Image Eval (MT2IE), an evaluation framework that iteratively generates prompts for evaluation, scores generated images and matches T2I evaluation of existing benchmarks with a fraction of the prompts used in existing static benchmarks. Moreover, we show that MT2IE's prompt-generation consistency scores have higher correlation with human judgment than scores previously introduced in the literature. MT2IE generates prompts that are efficient at probing T2I model performance, producing the same relative T2I model rankings as existing benchmarks while using only 1/80th the number of prompts for evaluation.

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning aims to quickly identify solutions for new tasks with minimal or no additional interaction with the environment. Generalized Policy Improvement (GPI) addresses this by combining a set of base policies to produce a new one that is at least as good -- though not necessarily optimal -- as any individual base policy. Optimality can be ensured, particularly in the linear-reward case, via techniques that compute a Convex Coverage Set (CCS). However, these are computationally expensive and do not scale to complex domains. The Option Keyboard (OK) improves upon GPI by producing policies that are at least as good -- and often better. It achieves this through a learned meta-policy that dynamically combines base policies. However, its performance critically depends on the choice of base policies. This raises a key question: is there an optimal set of base policies -- an optimal behavior basis -- that enables zero-shot identification of optimal solutions for any linear tasks? We solve this open problem by introducing a novel method that efficiently constructs such an optimal behavior basis. We show that it significantly reduces the number of base policies needed to ensure optimality in new tasks. We also prove that it is strictly more expressive than a CCS, enabling particular classes of non-linear tasks to be solved optimally. We empirically evaluate our technique in challenging domains and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, increasingly so as task complexity increases.

Summary:
The paper discusses the challenges of gradient-based bilevel optimization, which often involves computationally expensive second-order and mixed derivatives. While automatic differentiation libraries simplify the calculation process, they may not fully utilize the problem structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, the authors propose MixFlow-MG, a practical algorithm that leverages mixed-mode differentiation to improve computational efficiency in meta-learning setups. MixFlow-MG can significantly reduce memory usage and wall-clock time, offering up to 10x memory savings and 25% faster computation compared to standard implementations. By utilizing mixed-mode differentiation, MixFlow-MG constructs more efficient computational graphs, enhancing the scalability and performance of gradient-based optimisation tasks in various applications like hyperparameter optimisation, task adaptation, and algorithm discovery. <div>

Abstract: Gradient-based bilevel optimisation is a powerful technique with applications in hyperparameter optimisation, task adaptation, algorithm discovery, meta-learning more broadly, and beyond. It often requires differentiating through the gradient-based optimisation process itself, leading to "gradient-of-a-gradient" calculations with computationally expensive second-order and mixed derivatives. While modern automatic differentiation libraries provide a convenient way to write programs for calculating these derivatives, they oftentimes cannot fully exploit the specific structure of these problems out-of-the-box, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we analyse such cases and propose Mixed-Flow Meta-Gradients, or MixFlow-MG -- a practical algorithm that uses mixed-mode differentiation to construct more efficient and scalable computational graphs yielding over 10x memory and up to 25% wall-clock time improvements over standard implementations in modern meta-learning setups.

Summary:
The article explores the Edge Assembly Crossover (EAX) algorithm, a leading heuristic for solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem. It focuses on improving the algorithm's first stage, introducing a method to quickly verify the validity of generated AB-cycles. This verification is crucial before applying other crossover operators like the Generalized Partition Crossover (GPX). Through proposed enhancements to EAX, the study shows improved computational efficiency and solution quality on challenging instances. The research highlights the significance of evaluating the initial phase of heuristic algorithms like EAX, paving the way for more effective solutions in complex optimization problems. <div>
arXiv:2505.00803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Edge Assembly Crossover (EAX) algorithm is the state-of-the-art heuristic for solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). It regularly outperforms other methods, such as the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun heuristic (LKH), across diverse sets of TSP instances. Essentially, EAX employs a two-stage mechanism that focuses on improving the current solutions, first, at the local and, subsequently, at the global level. Although the second phase of the algorithm has been thoroughly studied, configured, and refined in the past, in particular, its first stage has hardly been examined.
  In this paper, we thus focus on the first stage of EAX and introduce a novel method that quickly verifies whether the AB-cycles, generated during its internal optimization procedure, yield valid tours -- or whether they need to be repaired. Knowledge of the latter is also particularly relevant before applying other powerful crossover operators such as the Generalized Partition Crossover (GPX). Based on our insights, we propose and evaluate several improved versions of EAX. According to our benchmark study across 10 000 different TSP instances, the most promising of our proposed EAX variants demonstrates improved computational efficiency and solution quality on previously rather difficult instances compared to the current state-of-the-art EAX algorithm.

Summary: 

The article discusses Mechanistic Interpretability, which focuses on understanding neural networks through causal explanations. The Explanatory View Hypothesis posits that neural networks inherently contain explanations that can be extracted and understood. It introduces the concept of Explanatory Faithfulness as a measure of how well an explanation aligns with a model. Mechanistic Interpretability is defined as the production of model-level, ontic, causal-mechanistic, and falsifiable explanations of neural networks, setting it apart from other interpretability paradigms and highlighting its inherent limitations. The Principle of Explanatory Optimism is proposed as a crucial factor for the success of Mechanistic Interpretability. This article provides a framework for understanding and evaluating the interpretability of neural networks through causal explanations.

Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability aims to understand neural networks through causal explanations. We argue for the Explanatory View Hypothesis: that Mechanistic Interpretability research is a principled approach to understanding models because neural networks contain implicit explanations which can be extracted and understood. We hence show that Explanatory Faithfulness, an assessment of how well an explanation fits a model, is well-defined. We propose a definition of Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) as the practice of producing Model-level, Ontic, Causal-Mechanistic, and Falsifiable explanations of neural networks, allowing us to distinguish MI from other interpretability paradigms and detail MI's inherent limits. We formulate the Principle of Explanatory Optimism, a conjecture which we argue is a necessary precondition for the success of Mechanistic Interpretability.

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel two-stage noisy learning framework to address the issue of degraded generalization performance in deep neural networks under noisy supervision. The framework utilizes a dynamically weighted loss function for instance-level optimization without the need for heavy hyperparameter tuning. A new metric called wrong event is introduced to effectively model the cleanliness and difficulty of individual samples. The framework first collects wrong event information to build a strong base model and then performs noise-robust training using a probabilistic model.

Abstract: Recent studies indicate that deep neural networks degrade in generalization performance under noisy supervision. Existing methods focus on isolating clean subsets or correcting noisy labels, facing limitations such as high computational costs, heavy hyperparameter tuning process, and coarse-grained optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage noisy learning framework that enables instance-level optimization through a dynamically weighted loss function, avoiding hyperparameter tuning. To obtain stable and accurate information about noise modeling, we introduce a simple yet effective metric, termed wrong event, which dynamically models the cleanliness and difficulty of individual samples while maintaining computational costs. Our framework first collects wrong event information and builds a strong base model. Then we perform noise-robust training on the base model, using a probabilistic model to handle the wrong event information of samples. Experiments on five synthetic and real-world LNL benchmarks demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance, achieves a nearly 75% reduction in computational time and improves model scalability.

Summary: 
This study introduces Spill The Beans, a novel method that utilizes cache side-channels to leak tokens generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). By co-locating an attack process with the victim model on shared hardware, the attackers can detect cache hits when accessing embedding vectors, leaking tokens. Despite the challenge of the LLMs' size quickly evicting embedding vectors from the cache, the researchers address this by balancing the number of monitored tokens against the leaked information. Through extensive experimentation, they demonstrate the feasibility of leaking tokens from LLMs using cache side-channels, highlighting a new vulnerability in LLM deployments. The findings emphasize that even sophisticated models are susceptible to traditional side-channel attacks, with implications for privacy and security in LLM-serving infrastructures. The study suggests mitigation strategies and showcases two concrete attack scenarios, showing high recovery rates for API keys and English text, with potential for improvement in more specialized output domains. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Side-channel attacks on shared hardware resources increasingly threaten confidentiality, especially with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce Spill The Beans, a novel application of cache side-channels to leak tokens generated by an LLM. By co-locating an attack process on the same hardware as the victim model, we flush and reload embedding vectors from the embedding layer, where each token corresponds to a unique embedding vector. When accessed during token generation, it results in a cache hit detectable by our attack on shared lower-level caches.
  A significant challenge is the massive size of LLMs, which, by nature of their compute intensive operation, quickly evicts embedding vectors from the cache. We address this by balancing the number of tokens monitored against the amount of information leaked. Monitoring more tokens increases potential vocabulary leakage but raises the chance of missing cache hits due to eviction; monitoring fewer tokens improves detection reliability but limits vocabulary coverage.
  Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the feasibility of leaking tokens from LLMs via cache side-channels. Our findings reveal a new vulnerability in LLM deployments, highlighting that even sophisticated models are susceptible to traditional side-channel attacks. We discuss the implications for privacy and security in LLM-serving infrastructures and suggest considerations for mitigating such threats. For proof of concept we consider two concrete attack scenarios: Our experiments show that an attacker can recover as much as 80%-90% of a high entropy API key with single shot monitoring. As for English text we can reach a 40% recovery rate with a single shot. We should note that the rate highly depends on the monitored token set and these rates can be improved by targeting more specialized output domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, enabling their widespread adoption across various domains. However, their susceptibility to prompt injection attacks poses significant security risks, as adversarial inputs can manipulate model behavior and override intended instructions. Despite numerous defense strategies, a standardized framework to rigorously evaluate their effectiveness, especially under adaptive adversarial scenarios, is lacking. To address this gap, we introduce OET, an optimization-based evaluation toolkit that systematically benchmarks prompt injection attacks and defenses across diverse datasets using an adaptive testing framework. Our toolkit features a modular workflow that facilitates adversarial string generation, dynamic attack execution, and comprehensive result analysis, offering a unified platform for assessing adversarial robustness. Crucially, the adaptive testing framework leverages optimization methods with both white-box and black-box access to generate worst-case adversarial examples, thereby enabling strict red-teaming evaluations. Extensive experiments underscore the limitations of current defense mechanisms, with some models remaining susceptible even after implementing security enhancements.

Summary:
ICQuant introduces a novel framework for outlier-aware weight-only quantization by utilizing outlier statistics to develop an efficient index coding scheme. It effectively shrinks quantization ranges with only approximately 0.3 bits overhead, thereby achieving significant savings in extreme compression scenarios. ICQuant can be applied alongside existing quantizers to enhance quantization quality. When employed with simple scalar quantizers using 2.3 bits per weight, ICQuant enhances the zero-shot accuracy of the 2-bit Llama3-70B model by up to 130% and 150% compared to QTIP and QuIP#, respectively. Furthermore, it delivers comparable performance to the top fine-tuned quantizer (PV-tuning) without requiring fine-tuning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The rapid deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights the need for efficient low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ), due to their high memory costs. A key challenge in weight quantization is the presence of outliers, which inflate quantization ranges and lead to large errors. While a number of outlier suppression techniques have been proposed, they either: fail to effectively shrink the quantization range, or incur (relatively) high bit overhead. In this paper, we present ICQuant, a novel framework that leverages outlier statistics to design an efficient index coding scheme for outlier-aware weight-only quantization. Compared to existing outlier suppression techniques requiring $\approx 1$ bit overhead to halve the quantization range, ICQuant requires only $\approx 0.3$ bits; a significant saving in extreme compression regimes (e.g., 2-3 bits per weight). ICQuant can be used on top of any existing quantizers to eliminate outliers, improving the quantization quality. Using just 2.3 bits per weight and simple scalar quantizers, ICQuant improves the zero-shot accuracy of the 2-bit Llama3-70B model by up to 130% and 150% relative to QTIP and QuIP#; and it achieves comparable performance to the best-known fine-tuned quantizer (PV-tuning) without fine-tuning.

<div> Keywords: Robots, Inverse Kinematics, Human-like physicality, Genetic Algorithm, Reachability map

Summary: 
Robots with human-like physicality are being developed to potentially replace human tasks, particularly in household service. However, size limitations often pose challenges in solving inverse kinematics (IK) due to joint angle constraints. This paper introduces a method to generate an optimal initial guess for numerical IK solvers based on the scaled Jacobian matrix and manipulability index, taking into account joint limits. By using a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the goodness of the initial guess, the probability of successfully solving IK is increased. Additionally, a reachability map is utilized to explore various IK solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that employing a better initial guess leads to higher IK solvability. The proposed method showcases its effectiveness by enabling a robot to achieve three distinct scenarios through optimized initial guesses. <div>

Abstract: Robots are strongly expected as a means of replacing human tasks. If a robot has a human-like physicality, the possibility of replacing human tasks increases. In the case of household service robots, it is desirable for them to be on a human-like size so that they do not become excessively large in order to coexist with humans in their operating environment. However, robots with size limitations tend to have difficulty solving inverse kinematics (IK) due to mechanical limitations, such as joint angle limitations. Conversely, if the difficulty coming from this limitation could be mitigated, one can expect that the use of such robots becomes more valuable. In numerical IK solver, which is commonly used for robots with higher degrees-of-freedom (DOF), the solvability of IK depends on the initial guess given to the solver. Thus, this paper proposes a method for generating a good initial guess for a numerical IK solver given the target hand configuration. For the purpose, we define the goodness of an initial guess using the scaled Jacobian matrix, which can calculate the manipulability index considering the joint limits. These two factors are related to the difficulty of solving IK. We generate the initial guess by optimizing the goodness using the genetic algorithm (GA). To enumerate much possible IK solutions, we use the reachability map that represents the reachable area of the robot hand in the arm-base coordinate system. We conduct quantitative evaluation and prove that using an initial guess that is judged to be better using the goodness value increases the probability that IK is solved. Finally, as an application of the proposed method, we show that by generating good initial guesses for IK a robot actually achieves three typical scenarios.

<div> Keywords: User preferences, Recommender systems, Natural language processing, Temporal modeling, Explainability<br />
Summary:<br />
This work introduces a novel approach using large language models to accurately model user preferences in recommender systems. By generating natural language summaries of users' interaction histories, the framework captures both short-term and long-term preferences. The use of pre-trained models and attention mechanisms enables a comprehensive user representation that improves recommendation accuracy. Furthermore, the approach supports explainability by providing interpretable text summaries and attention weights to users. Real-world experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in enhancing recommendation performance and generating transparent justifications for content-based recommendations. The incorporation of temporal modeling and natural language processing offers a promising avenue for advancing user profiling in recommender systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurately modeling user preferences is vital not only for improving recommendation performance but also for enhancing transparency in recommender systems. Conventional user profiling methods, such as averaging item embeddings, often overlook the evolving, nuanced nature of user interests, particularly the interplay between short-term and long-term preferences. In this work, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language summaries of users' interaction histories, distinguishing recent behaviors from more persistent tendencies. Our framework not only models temporal user preferences but also produces natural language profiles that can be used to explain recommendations in an interpretable manner. These textual profiles are encoded via a pre-trained model, and an attention mechanism dynamically fuses the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user representation. Beyond boosting recommendation accuracy over multiple baselines, our approach naturally supports explainability: the interpretable text summaries and attention weights can be exposed to end users, offering insights into why specific items are suggested. Experiments on real-world datasets underscore both the performance gains and the promise of generating clearer, more transparent justifications for content-based recommendations.

Summary:
The paper introduces Learnable Transformation-based Generalized Time Encoding (LeTE) as a method to effectively model diverse and complex time patterns in real-world scenarios. By utilizing deep function learning techniques to parameterize non-linear transformations in time encoding, LeTE allows for the modeling of generalized time patterns. This approach improves upon existing time encoding methods by making the transformations learnable and adaptable to various temporal dynamics. LeTE encompasses previous methods as specific cases and can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of tasks. Experimental results across diverse domains demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of LeTE in capturing and encoding time information for applications involving chronologically occurring events. <div>

Abstract: Effectively modeling time information and incorporating it into applications or models involving chronologically occurring events is crucial. Real-world scenarios often involve diverse and complex time patterns, which pose significant challenges for time encoding methods. While previous methods focus on capturing time patterns, many rely on specific inductive biases, such as using trigonometric functions to model periodicity. This narrow focus on single-pattern modeling makes them less effective in handling the diversity and complexities of real-world time patterns. In this paper, we investigate to improve the existing commonly used time encoding methods and introduce Learnable Transformation-based Generalized Time Encoding (LeTE). We propose using deep function learning techniques to parameterize non-linear transformations in time encoding, making them learnable and capable of modeling generalized time patterns, including diverse and complex temporal dynamics. By enabling learnable transformations, LeTE encompasses previous methods as specific cases and allows seamless integration into a wide range of tasks. Through extensive experiments across diverse domains, we demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of LeTE.

Summary: 
The paper addresses the challenge of fine-tuning policies learned offline, which often results in performance degradation during the initial stages. Existing algorithms either exhibit performance degradation or slow learning during fine-tuning. The proposed algorithm, based on Jump Start, gradually increases exploration based on online performance estimates to achieve fast and effective fine-tuning. By doing so, it reduces performance degradation compared to current algorithms. This approach aims to improve the efficiency of fine-tuning learned networks online, providing a more stable and effective method for policy improvement. <div>

Abstract: Fine-tuning policies learned offline remains a major challenge in application domains. Monotonic performance improvement during \emph{fine-tuning} is often challenging, as agents typically experience performance degradation at the early fine-tuning stage. The community has identified multiple difficulties in fine-tuning a learned network online, however, the majority of progress has focused on improving learning efficiency during fine-tuning. In practice, this comes at a serious cost during fine-tuning: initially, agent performance degrades as the agent explores and effectively overrides the policy learned offline. We show across a range of settings, many offline-to-online algorithms exhibit either (1) performance degradation or (2) slow learning (sometimes effectively no improvement) during fine-tuning. We introduce a new fine-tuning algorithm, based on an algorithm called Jump Start, that gradually allows more exploration based on online estimates of performance. Empirically, this approach achieves fast fine-tuning and significantly reduces performance degradations compared with existing algorithms designed to do the same.

Summary:<br />
Conformal Selection (CS) is a method used in applications like drug discovery and language models for selecting high-quality candidates from large datasets. However, it is limited to univariate responses. To address this limitation, Multivariate Conformal Selection (mCS) is proposed as a generalization of CS for multivariate response settings. mCS introduces regional monotonicity and utilizes multivariate nonconformity scores to construct conformal p-values, ensuring finite-sample False Discovery Rate (FDR) control. Two variants of mCS are presented: mCS-dist, using distance-based scores, and mCS-learn, which optimizes scores through differentiable optimization. Experimental results on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the improved selection power of mCS while maintaining FDR control, establishing it as a robust framework for multivariate selection tasks.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large datasets is critical in applications such as drug discovery, precision medicine, and alignment of large language models (LLMs). While Conformal Selection (CS) provides rigorous uncertainty quantification, it is limited to univariate responses and scalar criteria. To address this issue, we propose Multivariate Conformal Selection (mCS), a generalization of CS designed for multivariate response settings. Our method introduces regional monotonicity and employs multivariate nonconformity scores to construct conformal p-values, enabling finite-sample False Discovery Rate (FDR) control. We present two variants: mCS-dist, using distance-based scores, and mCS-learn, which learns optimal scores via differentiable optimization. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that mCS significantly improves selection power while maintaining FDR control, establishing it as a robust framework for multivariate selection tasks.

Summary: 
The article discusses the growing importance of IoT devices in various applications and the task of sensing and transmitting information in IoT networks. Traditional routing protocols optimize static objectives, but real-world IoT applications require adapting to dynamic priorities. To address this, the authors propose a dynamic and distributed routing approach based on multiobjective Q-learning, which can adjust to changing preferences in real-time. They introduce a greedy interpolation policy scheme to make near-optimal decisions for unexpected preference changes. By utilizing Pareto-efficient solutions for dynamic preferences, the proposed scheme outperforms existing algorithms in terms of overall reward, energy efficiency, and packet delivery ratio. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in adapting to different exploration strategies and preference variations. <div>

Abstract: The last few decades have witnessed a rapid increase in IoT devices owing to their wide range of applications, such as smart healthcare monitoring systems, smart cities, and environmental monitoring. A critical task in IoT networks is sensing and transmitting information over the network. The IoT nodes gather data by sensing the environment and then transmit this data to a destination node via multi-hop communication, following some routing protocols. These protocols are usually designed to optimize possibly contradictory objectives, such as maximizing packet delivery ratio and energy efficiency. While most literature has focused on optimizing a static objective that remains unchanged, many real-world IoT applications require adapting to rapidly shifting priorities. For example, in monitoring systems, some transmissions are time-critical and require a high priority on low latency, while other transmissions are less urgent and instead prioritize energy efficiency. To meet such dynamic demands, we propose novel dynamic and distributed routing based on multiobjective Q-learning that can adapt to changes in preferences in real-time. Our algorithm builds on ideas from both multi-objective optimization and Q-learning. We also propose a novel greedy interpolation policy scheme to take near-optimal decisions for unexpected preference changes. The proposed scheme can approximate and utilize the Pareto-efficient solutions for dynamic preferences, thus utilizing past knowledge to adapt to unpredictable preferences quickly during runtime. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for various exploration strategies, preference variation patterns, and important metrics like overall reward, energy efficiency, and packet delivery ratio.

Abstract: This study investigates the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to scale-up Dynamic Assessment (DA). To facilitate such an investigation, we first developed DynaWrite-a modular, microservices-based grammatical tutoring application which supports multiple LLMs to generate dynamic feedback to learners of English. Initial testing of 21 LLMs, revealed GPT-4o and neural chat to have the most potential to scale-up DA in the language learning classroom. Further testing of these two candidates found both models performed similarly in their ability to accurately identify grammatical errors in user sentences. However, GPT-4o consistently outperformed neural chat in the quality of its DA by generating clear, consistent, and progressively explicit hints. Real-time responsiveness and system stability were also confirmed through detailed performance testing, with GPT-4o exhibiting sufficient speed and stability. This study shows that LLMs can be used to scale-up dynamic assessment and thus enable dynamic assessment to be delivered to larger groups than possible in traditional teacher-learner settings.

<div> Keywords: bike-sharing systems, self-supervised Transformer, fault detection, spatiotemporal features, shared mobility<br />
Summary:
The paper introduces a novel Self-Supervised Transformer (SSTransformer) framework for detecting faulty shared bikes in bike-sharing systems. The framework leverages spatiotemporal features extracted from GPS trajectories and trip records to automate the identification of unusable bikes. Through self-supervised pre-training, the Transformer encoder learns generalized representations of bike movement before adapting to a downstream binary classification task. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset of 10,730 bikes from Chengdu, China show that SSTransformer outperforms traditional machine learning models, ensemble learning, and deep learning baselines, achieving high accuracy (97.81%), precision (0.8889), and F1-score (0.9358). The study emphasizes the effectiveness of self-supervised Transformer models in capturing complex anomalies in bike-sharing systems, offering a promising approach for enhancing the maintenance and reliability of shared mobility solutions. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The rapid expansion of bike-sharing systems (BSS) has greatly improved urban "last-mile" connectivity, yet large-scale deployments face escalating operational challenges, particularly in detecting faulty bikes. Existing detection approaches either rely on static model-based thresholds that overlook dynamic spatiotemporal (ST) usage patterns or employ supervised learning methods that struggle with label scarcity and class imbalance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Self-Supervised Transformer (SSTransformer) framework for automatically detecting unusable shared bikes, leveraging ST features extracted from GPS trajectories and trip records. The model incorporates a self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance its feature extraction capabilities, followed by fine-tuning for efficient status recognition. In the pre-training phase, the Transformer encoder learns generalized representations of bike movement via a self-supervised objective; in the fine-tuning phase, the encoder is adapted to a downstream binary classification task. Comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset of 10,730 bikes (1,870 unusable, 8,860 normal) from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SSTransformer significantly outperforms traditional machine learning, ensemble learning, and deep learning baselines, achieving the best accuracy (97.81%), precision (0.8889), and F1-score (0.9358). This work highlights the effectiveness of self-supervised Transformer on ST data for capturing complex anomalies in BSS, paving the way toward more reliable and scalable maintenance solutions for shared mobility.

A new field called Embodied Artificial Intelligence, which places at the intersection of Computer Vision, Robotics, and Decision Making, has been gaining importance during the last few years, as it aims to foster the development of smart autonomous robots and their deployment in society. The recent availability of large collections of 3D models for photorealistic robotic simulation has allowed faster and safe training of learning-based agents for millions of frames and a careful evaluation of their behavior before deploying the models on real robotic platforms.

To this end, during the training in simulation, the agents learn to perform continuous interactions with the surroundings, such as gathering information from the environment, encoding and extracting useful cues for the task, and performing actions towards the final goal; where every action of the agent influences the interactions. This dissertation follows the complete creation process of embodied agents for indoor environments, from their concept to their implementation and deployment.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot object detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects across different domains with limited class instances. Feature confusion, including object-background confusion and object-object confusion, presents significant challenges in both cross-domain and few-shot settings. In this work, we introduce CDFormer, a cross-domain few-shot object detection transformer against feature confusion, to address these challenges. The method specifically tackles feature confusion through two key modules: object-background distinguishing (OBD) and object-object distinguishing (OOD). The OBD module leverages a learnable background token to differentiate between objects and background, while the OOD module enhances the distinction between objects of different classes. Experimental results demonstrate that CDFormer outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 12.9% mAP, 11.0% mAP, and 10.4% mAP improvements under the 1/5/10 shot settings, respectively, when fine-tuned.

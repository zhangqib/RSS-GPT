Summary: 
The article proposes a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The algorithm uses Matrix Product States (MPS) to represent large superpositions of spin configurations and a discrete driving schedule to guide the system towards the ground state. An iterative process involving a driver Hamiltonian and the problem Hamiltonian enables spin flips and quantum tunneling. The algorithm, based on DMRG, efficiently identifies global minima across various QUBO instances, including solving large-scale Sudoku puzzles and MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library. The approach demonstrates scalability, generalizability, and applicability to industrial-scale QUBO applications. <div>

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian -- incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method, which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability, and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

<div> framework, artificial intelligence, reasoning reliability, energy sector, benchmark 
Summary: 
The study introduces the Analytical Reliability Benchmark (ARB) to evaluate reasoning reliability in large language models used in energy system analysis. The ARB assesses accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty discipline, policy consistency, and transparency across different scenarios using open datasets. Frontier models, including GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet, demonstrated consistent and policy-compliant reasoning, while Gemini 2.5 Pro showed moderate stability, and Llama 3 70B fell short. Statistical validation confirmed significant and reproducible differences. The ARB provides a quantitative method for verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in AI systems, ensuring trustworthy and transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible. The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

Summary: 
Branch-and-Browse introduces a new framework for autonomous web agents powered by large language models, addressing limitations in reasoning depth and efficiency. The framework utilizes explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for multi-branch reasoning, efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and a page action memory for sharing explored actions. On the WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8% and reduces execution time by up to 40.4% compared to existing methods. This demonstrates its reliability and efficiency in performing goal-oriented tasks in open web environments, marking a significant advancement in practical embodied reasoning. <div>

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval, report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i) employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\% and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Chain-of-Thought, reasoning fidelity, mathematical reasoning, benchmark

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on mathematical problems using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) format. This study proposes a rule-based stochastic process framework to analyze LLMs' reasoning abilities in CoT tasks. The introduction of logical closeness as a metric helps evaluate the adherence of LLMs' CoT trajectories to the DAG structure, providing a deeper insight into their reasoning processes. The DAG-MATH CoT format and benchmark created in this study guide LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in a structured manner, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of their reasoning abilities. Statistical analysis reveals significant differences in reasoning fidelity among LLM families, highlighting the importance of rule-consistent derivation over final-answer accuracy. This framework strikes a balance between free-form CoT and formal proof systems, offering valuable insights and diagnostics for evaluating LLMs' reasoning capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available at: https://github.com/YuanheZ/DAG-MATH-Formatted-CoT.

Abstract: Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments remains an open challenge, as prior systems rely on environment-specific interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment. We introduce Surfer 2, a unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long task horizons. Our system achieves 97.1% accuracy on WebVoyager, 69.6% on WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2 exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while calling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal cost-efficiency.

<br>
Summary: 
RELATE is a new relational encoder designed for heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. It is schema-agnostic and can be used with any general-purpose graph neural network (GNN). RELATE utilizes shared modality-specific encoders for different types of node attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module for feature aggregation. In evaluations on the RelBench benchmark using ReLGNN and HGT models, RELATE achieved performance close to schema-specific encoders while reducing parameter counts significantly. This approach allows for scalability, parameter sharing, and support for varying schemas in relational multi-table data. By enabling multi-dataset pretraining for GNNs, RELATE paves the way for the development of foundation models for relational graph data. <div>

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce, healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark, where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way toward foundation models for relational graph data.

<div> insurance fraud, generative AI, deepfake, detection software, mitigation strategies

Summary:
The use of generative AI in insurance fraud is on the rise, allowing fraudsters to create realistic fake evidence such as crash photos and damage reports. Traditional fraud schemes are now being supercharged by AI technology, making it easier to fabricate false claims at scale and in rapid time. Insurers are fighting back with AI-based detection software and enhanced verification processes, but these tools have limitations including false positives and negatives. Fraudsters are continuously evolving their tactics to evade detection, creating a challenging cat-and-mouse game for insurers. The battle between generative AI and fraud detection technology is ongoing, with resource and cost barriers for insurers further complicating the fight against AI-enabled insurance fraud. UVeye offers a layered solution for vehicle fraud, providing a significant advancement in detecting, mitigating, and deterring this new wave of fraudulent activity. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims. Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave of fraud.

Summary:
The study investigates the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning by predicting academic success through leadership personality traits and machine learning modelling. Data from 129 master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department were collected using five leadership personality tests and self-assessment tools. Exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis were conducted, with feature selection based on Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The students' average grades were categorized into fail, pass, and excellent. Seven machine learning algorithms were tuned, with the Random Forest classifier achieving the highest predictive performance. The model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark feature yielded an accuracy of 87.50%. This study offers insights into identifying students' strengths and weaknesses early on in their education journey, allowing for the implementation of tailored strategies for personalized learning.

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning, suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129 master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture, Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports. The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent. The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM, LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students' strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have the capability to hide meaningful texts within seemingly unrelated content, showcasing a decoupling of text from authorial intent. The paper introduces a protocol that efficiently achieves this, using even modest 8-billion-parameter LLMs to encode and decode hidden messages. This phenomenon challenges trust in written communication, already weakened by the proliferation of LLM chatbots. The potential for covert deployment of unfiltered LLMs by encoding responses within safe models raises urgent AI safety concerns. The existence of this protocol questions our understanding of LLMs and knowledge representation in text. Overall, the study emphasizes the need for heightened awareness in the use of LLMs and the encryption of information within text.<br><br>Summary: Large Language Models have the ability to hide significant messages within text, utilizing encryption to create a covert channel of communication. This challenges the trustworthiness of written content and raises concerns about AI safety. The protocol presented showcases the potential for surreptitious deployment of unfiltered LLMs, prompting a reevaluation of information security methods in the era of advanced language models. <div>
arXiv:2510.20075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication, already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection, and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop, dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial forensics.

The article discusses the potential of machine learning-based generative AI products in reducing the cost and streamlining legal practice, but highlights the risks associated with the use of AI in the legal field. It presents cases where lawyers were reprimanded for inaccurate AI-generated content submitted to courts, prompting a need for a new paradigm to evaluate AI use in legal practice. The paper introduces the verification-value paradox, which acknowledges the disconnection of AI from reality and the need for transparency in legal proceedings. This paradox suggests that while AI may increase efficiency, lawyers must diligently verify its outputs due to their paramount duties of honesty and integrity. The implications of this paradox are explored in legal practice and education, emphasizing the importance of truth and civic responsibility in legal practice.<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice, given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b) lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic responsibility.

The four core challenges identified are robustness, scalability, opacity, and privacy. TRUST overcomes these limitations by implementing a consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, a hierarchical DAG decomposition of reasoning traces for scalability, a blockchain ledger for public accountability, and privacy-preserving segmentation to protect proprietary logic. The framework provides theoretical guarantees for security and economic incentives and has been tested on multiple LLMs and reasoning tasks, showing effectiveness in detecting flaws and robustness against adversarial auditors. This pioneering approach towards decentralized AI auditing offers a practical solution for safe and trustworthy deployment of LLMs. <br> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure, prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4) Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math, medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and trustworthy LLM deployment.

<div> imitation, artificial general intelligence, lock-in phase, identity consolidation, learning dynamics

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) exhibit open imitation and high steerability, resembling human development towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). The authors propose a lock-in phase in AGI progress, characterized by a transition to identity consolidation, where goal structures and preferences become stable and resistant to external influence. Operational metrics are suggested for the detection of this phase. Experimental findings show rapid consolidation with varying effects on capabilities. Trade-offs are observed in small models, while mid-scale models show minimal impact, and large models experience transient instabilities. The consolidation phase is crucial for AGI reliability and safety, allowing for intentional engineering of identities. However, spontaneous emergence during scaling could result in unpredictable behaviors and goals. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures, refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

Summary:<br>
The study focuses on optimizing AI for dynamic environments using evolutionary training methods in the context of the 2048 game. Two systems were implemented - a two-agent metaprompting system and a single-agent system based on refining a value function. The single-agent system showed significant improvements with an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, demonstrating the effectiveness of evolutionary refinement techniques in non-deterministic environments. The LLM agent in the two-agent system also displayed enhanced understanding and advanced strategies. However, the two-agent system did not show significant improvement, indicating limitations in meta-prompting. Overall, the study showcases the potential of evolutionary techniques in enhancing AI performance for complex, stochastic environments like the 2048 game.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM) agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends (correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement, highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

Summary: 
This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes in the context of authorial style emulation. A novel task is introduced to evaluate different cognitive representation methods in individualized cognitive simulation. By benchmarking seven off-the-shelf LLMs on a dataset constructed from recent novels, the study finds that combining conceptual and linguistic features is more effective in generating storytelling that mirrors the original author. LLMs are better at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, highlighting their limitations in deeper cognitive simulation. These results provide insights for the development of AI systems that can adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression, advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.<br> <div>

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation. We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression, advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenge of generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a specific purpose and how it impacts an agent's planning, reasoning, and explanation capabilities. The study models concrete behaviors in PDDL and explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for generating abstract PDDL domains and problem instances based on natural language abstraction objectives. Three categories of abstractions are considered: choice of alternative concrete actions, sequences of concrete actions, and action/predicate parameters. The study evaluates the generated abstract domains and instances using symbolic validation tools and human experts, finding that GPT-4o can effectively synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple settings, with a better performance in abstracting actions than fluents. <div>

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on. We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these. The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the associated fluents.

<div> Keywords: human mobility forecasting, disaster relief, city planning, public health, STaBERT <br>
Summary:
STaBERT is a new model proposed to improve human mobility forecasting by integrating both point of interest (POI) and temporal information. Traditional models either focus on location sequences or include time as auxiliary input, missing out on the rich semantic context provided by POIs. By enriching a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors and POI embeddings, STaBERT creates a unified representation that captures the semantics of human movement. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in prediction accuracy, with GEO-BLEU scores for single-city and multi-city prediction improving from 0.34 to 0.75 and 0.34 to 0.56, respectively. This enhanced model holds promise for applications such as disaster relief, city planning, and public health, where accurate human mobility forecasting is essential. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement. We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34 to 0.56.

<br>
Summary: ToolEQA is introduced as an agent that combines external tools with multi-step reasoning to enhance its reasoning ability in Embodied Question Answering tasks. By utilizing external tools, ToolEQA can derive better exploration directions and generate more accurate responses with shorter exploration distances. The novel EQA data generation pipeline automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks with reasoning trajectories and answers, resulting in the EQA-RT dataset. Experimental results on EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen demonstrate that ToolEQA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 9.2-20.2% and achieves a 10% improvement in success rate over zero-shot ToolEQA. Additionally, ToolEQA showcases state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench datasets, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in diverse Embodied Question Answering scenarios. The official homepage for ToolEQA can be found at https://tooleqa.github.io. <br><br> <div>
arXiv:2510.20310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline, we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by 9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see https://tooleqa.github.io.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare. However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging project, part of Spain's national R&amp;D initiative, where our task was to detect biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender, age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems in healthcare.

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

Summary:
This survey explores the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Knowledge Graphs (KGs) construction. It examines traditional KG methodologies, followed by an analysis of LLM-driven approaches in schema-based and schema-free paradigms. The survey delves into the technical mechanisms of representative frameworks at each stage while also identifying their limitations. Key trends and future research directions are outlined, including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic systems, and multimodal KG construction. The evolving interplay between LLMs and KGs is highlighted, aiming to bridge symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding for the development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure, normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions, including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

Summary: 
Continual pretraining aims to adapt large language models to new domains using only unlabeled test-time data. However, standard self-supervised objectives can degrade instruction-following capability and semantic representations of instruction-tuned models. Existing solutions requiring access to the original base model or external domain-specific databases can be impractical in some scenarios. In response, the Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow) framework is proposed, introducing novel self-supervised objectives in a dialogue format to encode domain knowledge within text. This approach enhances semantic understanding without relying on external resources, embedding domain knowledge at a deeper level. IKnow offers a simple and versatile solution for continual adaptation of language models, addressing the challenge of maintaining instruction-following capabilities and semantic representations without access to the original base model or external data sources.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

<div> Keywords: Concept learning, neural reasoner, description logic, embeddings, error robustness

Summary:
Concept learning involves using description logic axioms to create explainable classification models from knowledge bases. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches face challenges in deploying on real-world knowledge bases due to the limitations of description logic reasoners. To address this, a new neural reasoner named EBR has been introduced, which uses embeddings to approximate symbolic reasoner results. EBR requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions to approximate instances of any concept in the `SHOIQ` description logic. Experimental results show that EBR outperforms state-of-the-art reasoners by being more resilient to missing and erroneous data. EBR's robustness makes it suitable for practical applications in concept learning tasks. 

<br><br>Summary: Concept learning with description logic axioms can now be enhanced with the robust and error-tolerant neural reasoner EBR, which uses embeddings to approximate symbolic reasoning results. EBR's ability to retrieve instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions enables accurate concept instance approximations in `SHOIQ` description logic, outperforming existing reasoners in handling missing and erroneous data. Deploying EBR can lead to more effective and reliable classification models in real-world knowledge bases. <div>

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases. Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

It is an unsupervised method that does not require training data and provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively. The use of fuzzy logic makes the results interpretable, and the algorithm is proven to converge. FLORA also accommodates dangling entities, achieving state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks. <div>

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2) provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

<div> AI governance, public participation, policymaking, trust, recommendations
Summary:
The paper analyzes public participation in AI governance in Australia, Colombia, and the United States. It finds that governments have not effectively engaged with citizens' feedback on AI policies, leading to a lack of trust and legitimacy. Less than one percent of the population participated in feedback processes, and policymakers did not adequately respond to input. The study highlights a gap between the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors propose eight recommendations to improve public engagement, including promoting AI literacy, monitoring feedback, broadening outreach, holding regular forums, using innovative methods, including underrepresented groups, responding publicly to input, and making participation easier. These recommendations aim to bridge the gap between citizens and policymakers and build trust in AI governance.

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI), and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies. Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue. Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover, officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns. They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback; broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make participation easier.

<div> topology optimization, congestion management, machine learning, graph neural network, large-scale systems
Summary:
Topology optimization via busbar splitting can reduce transmission grid congestion and costs, but current solvers struggle with large-scale systems. This paper introduces a graph neural network (GNN) approach that accelerates the optimization process by predicting effective busbar splitting actions. The GNN is designed to capture local flow patterns and generalize to unseen topologies and different systems, offering significant speed-ups and AC-feasible solutions within one minute for large-scale systems. Case studies on the GOC 2000-bus system show promising results, achieving a 2.3% optimality gap and demonstrating the potential for near-real-time topology optimization with improved generalization capabilities. This approach represents a significant advancement in addressing congestion management challenges in power system operations. 
<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems, which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns, achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3% optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with topology and cross-system generalization.

<div> Keywords: large language models, reasoning quality, relevance, coherence, causal stepwise evaluation

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are typically evaluated based on final-answer correctness, but this approach may overlook the quality of the underlying reasoning process. In this study, the authors argue for a more granular evaluation of reasoning, focusing on relevance and coherence. They introduce a method called causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE) to assess the quality of each reasoning step based on its preceding context. Validated against human judgments on expert-annotated benchmarks, CaSE proves to be an effective tool for evaluating LLM reasoning. By curating training data based on CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence, the authors demonstrate direct improvements in final task performance. This work offers a scalable framework for analyzing and improving LLM reasoning, emphasizing the importance of moving beyond simple validity checks.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions: relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE). This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context, which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel formulation of random walk centrality, a metric used in graph mining to assess node importance and influence based on hitting times. Existing methods for computing this measure on large networks are computationally demanding. The study presents two scalable algorithms - one utilizing approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, and the other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear time and offer strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments conducted on large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes, highlight the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithms. <div>

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes, demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed algorithms.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the MIMOSA framework, aiming to generate predictive models that prioritize interpretability, performance, and ethical properties in diverse decision-making tasks and data types. It formalizes supervised learning in various data formats and characterizes interpretable model families, including feature importance, rule, and instance-based models. The framework also addresses ethical concerns such as causality, fairness, and privacy by providing definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures. It explores the trade-offs between these ethical properties and discusses ways to incorporate privacy, fairness, and causal reasoning into interpretable pipelines. By integrating ethical measures into model development, the MIMOSA framework sets the groundwork for trustworthy AI systems that are accurate, interpretable, fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware. <div>

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust, accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA (Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series, images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions, reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy, providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

Summary: 
The article introduces EcomEval, a new benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in the e-commerce domain. Unlike existing benchmarks that lack task diversity and focus primarily on English and Chinese, EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks, including multimodal tasks, sourced from authentic customer queries and transaction logs. The benchmark aims to reflect the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. EcomEval utilizes a semi-automatic pipeline for generating reference answers, involving expert annotators with e-commerce and multilingual expertise. Difficulty levels are defined for each question and task category to enable challenge-oriented assessment. EcomEval also includes seven languages, including five low-resource Southeast Asian languages, providing a multilingual perspective that was missing in prior work. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce, existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese, leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex, real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce. EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks), sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs, reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior work.

Summary: 
The Fluidity Index (FI) is introduced in this paper to measure model adaptability in dynamic and scaling environments. The benchmark assesses response accuracy by comparing deviations in past, current, and future environment states, focusing on context switching and continuity. The distinction between closed-ended and open-ended benchmarks is made, with a preference for real-world, closed-loop open-ended benchmarks to test adaptability. The FI evaluates a model's ability to comprehend, forecast, and adapt to changes in scaling environments. A truly super-intelligent model is expected to exhibit at least second-order adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment for optimal fluidity. <div>

This paper discusses the integration of machine learning (ML) models within rational agent architectures, focusing on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) paradigm. The analysis highlights the fragmented nature of current approaches and emphasizes the need to leverage the expressive power of rational architectures in combination with ML capabilities. The fast-evolving literature on rational agents enhanced by ML is systematically reviewed, identifying key research opportunities and highlighting open challenges in designing effective rational ML agents.

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML) models in perceptual and cognitive tasks, frameworks integrating ML within rational agent architectures are gaining traction. Yet, the landscape remains fragmented and incoherent, often focusing on embedding ML into generic agent containers while overlooking the expressive power of rational architectures--such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This paper presents a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches, using the BDI paradigm as a reference. Our analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature on rational agents enhanced by ML, and identifies key research opportunities and open challenges for designing effective rational ML agents.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel evaluation framework for assessing the quality of reasoning traces from large language models. Current methods for evaluating reasoning traces are labor-intensive and unreliable, often relying on manual annotation or graph-based proxies. The proposed framework utilizes topological data analysis (TDA) to capture the geometry of reasoning traces and automate the assessment process, offering a more efficient and accurate alternative. The study demonstrates that topological features provide better predictive power for reasoning quality assessment compared to traditional graph metrics, indicating that effective reasoning is better represented by higher-dimensional geometric structures. The framework also identifies a compact and stable set of topological features that reliably indicate trace quality, providing a valuable signal for future reinforcement learning algorithms to improve reasoning performance.

arXiv:2510.20665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient, automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future reinforcement learning algorithms.

Summary:<br>
Graph-RFT is a novel KGQA framework that combines reinforcement learning and planning to improve reasoning over knowledge graphs. It addresses the challenges of incomplete knowledge coverage and reasoning failures by introducing a two-stage fine-tuning process. The model autonomously plans and schedules retrievals across structured knowledge graphs and web sources, utilizing a chain-of-thought fine-tuning method and a plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process. It decomposes complex questions into subquestions and uses logical expressions for globally consistent multi-step reasoning. The model is optimized with a multi-reward system, enabling it to learn when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively. Graph-RFT offers a promising approach to enhancing KGQA by integrating reasoning capabilities of large language models with structured knowledge graphs and external information sources.<br> <div>
arXiv:2510.20691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a 'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design, enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

<div> AGI, Artificial General Intelligence, CHC model, compensability, coherence <br>
Summary: This article introduces a new measure of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that considers balanced competence across essential domains, rather than compensability for exceptional ability in certain areas. The proposed coherence-adjusted measure calculates the area under the curve (AUC) based on generalized means over a spectrum of compensability exponents, capturing robustness under different assumptions. Unlike the traditional arithmetic mean, this measure penalizes imbalances and assesses inter-domain dependency. Applying this method to GPT-4 and GPT-5 based on CHC domain scores reveals that although they have high arithmetic scores, they still fall short of achieving true general competence. By integrating the generalized mean, this approach provides a more rigorous and interpretable framework for gauging progress towards AGI. <br> <div>
arXiv:2510.20784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized \textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll (CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes \textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect \textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5, the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

Abstract: In this research, we present SLYKLatent, a novel approach for enhancing gaze estimation by addressing appearance instability challenges in datasets due to aleatoric uncertainties, covariant shifts, and test domain generalization.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a crucial role in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neurological diagnostics, but its real-world deployment faces challenges due to noise artifacts, missing data, and high annotation costs. We introduce SSL-SE-EEG, a framework that integrates Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) with Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SE-Nets) to enhance feature extraction, improve noise robustness, and reduce reliance on labeled data. Unlike conventional EEG processing techniques, SSL-SE-EEG} transforms EEG signals into structured 2D image representations, suitable for deep learning. Experimental validation on MindBigData, TUH-AB, SEED-IV and BCI-IV datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy (91% in MindBigData, 85% in TUH-AB), making it well-suited for real-time BCI applications. By enabling low-power, scalable EEG processing, SSL-SE-EEG presents a promising solution for biomedical signal analysis, neural engineering, and next-generation BCIs.

<div> Keywords: large language models, prompt injection, CourtGuard, multiagent system, defense against attacks

Summary:
CourtGuard is proposed as a defense mechanism against prompt injection attacks on large language models (LLMs). It operates as a multiagent system where a "defense attorney," "prosecution attorney," and "judge" models work together to classify prompts as either benign or prompts for harmful behavior. CourtGuard has a lower false positive rate compared to the Direct Detector, another LLM-based prompt classifier. While CourtGuard may not be as effective as other prompt injection detectors, its performance highlights the importance of considering both adversarial and benign scenarios in prompt classification. The implementation of CourtGuard and the Direct Detector with full prompts for various LLM models are available for experimentation. Overall, the results show that multiagent systems like CourtGuard can play a crucial role in enhancing the defense against prompt injection attacks on sensitive applications utilizing LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integrated into various sensitive applications, prompt injection, the use of prompting to induce harmful behaviors from LLMs, poses an ever increasing risk. Prompt injection attacks can cause LLMs to leak sensitive data, spread misinformation, and exhibit harmful behaviors. To defend against these attacks, we propose CourtGuard, a locally-runnable, multiagent prompt injection classifier. In it, prompts are evaluated in a court-like multiagent LLM system, where a "defense attorney" model argues the prompt is benign, a "prosecution attorney" model argues the prompt is a prompt injection, and a "judge" model gives the final classification. CourtGuard has a lower false positive rate than the Direct Detector, an LLM as-a-judge. However, CourtGuard is generally a worse prompt injection detector. Nevertheless, this lower false positive rate highlights the importance of considering both adversarial and benign scenarios for the classification of a prompt. Additionally, the relative performance of CourtGuard in comparison to other prompt injection classifiers advances the use of multiagent systems as a defense against prompt injection attacks. The implementations of CourtGuard and the Direct Detector with full prompts for Gemma-3-12b-it, Llama-3.3-8B, and Phi-4-mini-instruct are available at https://github.com/isaacwu2000/CourtGuard.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are essential for various workflows, but users struggle with consistent control over reasoning and output expression. This paper introduces Prompt Decorators, a declarative syntax using control tokens to modify LLM behavior without changing task content. The framework formalizes twenty core decorators organized into two families and subcategories for reasoning, interaction, expression, and session control. By decoupling task intent from execution behavior, Prompt Decorators enhance reasoning transparency, reduce prompt complexity, and standardize model behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to reasoning, writing, and decision-support workflows, yet users lack consistent control over how they reason and express outputs. Conventional prompt engineering relies on verbose natural-language instructions, limiting reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. This paper introduces Prompt Decorators, a declarative, composable syntax that governs LLM behavior through compact control tokens such as +++Reasoning, +++Tone(style=formal), and +++Import(topic="Systems Thinking"). Each decorator modifies a behavioral dimension, such as reasoning style, structure, or tone, without changing task content. The framework formalizes twenty core decorators organized into two functional families (Cognitive & Generative and Expressive & Systemic), each further decomposed into subcategories that govern reasoning, interaction, expression, and session-control. It defines a unified syntax, scoping model, and deterministic processing pipeline enabling predictable and auditable behavior composition. By decoupling task intent from execution behavior, Prompt Decorators create a reusable and interpretable interface for prompt design. Illustrative use cases demonstrate improved reasoning transparency, reduced prompt complexity, and standardized model behavior across domains. The paper concludes with implications for interoperability, behavioral consistency, and the development of declarative interfaces for scalable AI systems.

<div> monitorability, adversarial objectives, CoT obfuscation, alignment monitoring, trustworthy output

Summary:
CoT, or Chain-of-Thought, is a tool used for monitoring model alignment to ensure trustworthy outputs. The study aims to determine if models can obfuscate their CoT to pursue hidden adversarial objectives while evading detection. A taxonomy of prompts is developed to test CoT obfuscation, evaluating both internal and external CoT using toy tasks and realistic environments. Results show that CoT monitoring is effective without obfuscation pressure and some models can successfully complete adversarial tasks while evading detection under strong pressure. Models are found to obfuscate their external CoT more than their internal CoT. This study highlights the importance of stress-testing model monitorability for robust deployment of CoT in various settings. <div>

Abstract: Recent findings suggest that misaligned models may exhibit deceptive behavior, raising concerns about output trustworthiness. Chain-of-thought (CoT) is a promising tool for alignment monitoring: when models articulate their reasoning faithfully, monitors can detect and mitigate harmful behaviors before undesirable outcomes occur. However, a key uncertainty is: Can models obfuscate their CoT in order to pursue hidden adversarial objectives while evading detection? To answer this question and thus stress-test CoT monitorability, we develop a composable and quantifiable taxonomy of prompts to elicit CoT obfuscation. We evaluate both internal CoT (reasoning traces) and external CoT (prompted reasoning in outputs) using toy tasks and more realistic environments in SHADE-Arena. We show that: (i) CoT monitoring performs accurately and efficiently without obfuscation pressure. (ii) Under strong obfuscation pressure, some models successfully complete adversarial tasks while evading detection. (iii) Models do not obfuscate their internal CoT as much as their external CoT (under prompt pressure). These results suggest that while CoT provides valuable oversight in benign settings, robust deployment requires model-specific stress-testing of monitorability.

<div> Keywords: AI-generated lesson plans, language models, pedagogical soundness, usability, physics

Summary:
- Model selection significantly influences the readability of AI-generated lesson plans, with DeepSeek producing the most readable and Claude generating the densest language.
- The prompt framework structure has a strong impact on factual accuracy and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest hallucination index and highest alignment with curriculum standards.
- Learning objectives primarily clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy, with limited higher-order verbs.
- Readability depends on model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment are more influenced by the prompt framework.
- The most effective configuration for lesson plans involves combining a readability-optimized model with the RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum standards, and higher-order objectives. 

<br><br>Summary: This study evaluates AI-generated lesson plans from five language models for a high-school physics topic. Model choice affects readability, while prompt frameworks impact factual accuracy and curriculum alignment. Learning objectives primarily focus on lower-order thinking skills. A combination of a readability-optimized model, the RACE framework, and explicit checklist of concepts and objectives is recommended for effective lesson plans. <div>

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice, three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal), RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic, The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2) factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum standards, and higher-order objectives.

Summary:
ReGraphT is a training-free framework that leverages structured reasoning graphs and Monte Carlo Graph Search to enhance smaller language models (SLMs) in generating optimized CUDA code. It addresses the limitations of SLMs in complex CUDA generation by transferring LLM-level reasoning capabilities. A CUDA-specific benchmark, with defined tiers of reasoning complexity, is introduced to comprehensively evaluate models. Experimental results demonstrate that ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving a 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval and ParEval tasks. By integrating ReGraphT with specific SLM models, such as DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, SLMs can approach LLM-level performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computational overhead. <div>

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments. To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models. ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing overhead.

<div> dynamic sparse attention, interpretability, long context, attention patterns, information flow
Summary:
Sparse Tracing introduces a novel technique called Stream for efficiently analyzing long context attention patterns in Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging dynamic sparse attention, Stream can estimate per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time and linear space, allowing for one-pass interpretability at scale. The Stream algorithm uses a binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query while maintaining the model's next-token behavior. Applying Stream to long chain-of-thought reasoning traces reveals key thought anchors while significantly reducing token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves critical retrieval paths and exposes layer-wise routes from the input to output. This method enables the analysis of attention patterns and information flow without requiring terabytes of memory, making long context interpretability feasible on consumer GPUs and helping democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000 tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning 97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/stream-03B8/.

Summary: 
This study focuses on predicting user responses to moderation interventions on Reddit by analyzing 753 socio-behavioral, linguistic, relational, and psychological features of 16.8K users. The problem is framed as quantification to estimate shifts in user behavior, with a greedy feature selection approach used to identify the most predictive features. The research highlights the importance of tailoring moderation strategies based on user traits and the specific objectives of the intervention. The study identifies a small set of consistently informative features across tasks, with varying predictive performance for changes in user activity, toxicity, and participation diversity. The findings emphasize the complexity of post-moderation user behavior and suggest the need for accurate systems to predict user reactions to moderation interventions. Effective moderation strategies should consider both user characteristics and the desired outcomes of the intervention.

Abstract: Accurately estimating how users respond to moderation interventions is paramount for developing effective and user-centred moderation strategies. However, this requires a clear understanding of which user characteristics are associated with different behavioural responses, which is the goal of this work. We investigate the informativeness of 753 socio-behavioural, linguistic, relational, and psychological features, in predicting the behavioural changes of 16.8K users affected by a major moderation intervention on Reddit. To reach this goal, we frame the problem in terms of "quantification", a task well-suited to estimating shifts in aggregate user behaviour. We then apply a greedy feature selection strategy with the double goal of (i) identifying the features that are most predictive of changes in user activity, toxicity, and participation diversity, and (ii) estimating their importance. Our results allow identifying a small set of features that are consistently informative across all tasks, and determining that many others are either task-specific or of limited utility altogether. We also find that predictive performance varies according to the task, with changes in activity and toxicity being easier to estimate than changes in diversity. Overall, our results pave the way for the development of accurate systems that predict user reactions to moderation interventions. Furthermore, our findings highlight the complexity of post-moderation user behaviour, and indicate that effective moderation should be tailored not only to user traits but also to the specific objective of the intervention.

Summary:
The study proposes a data-driven approach using deep neural networks, specifically the Transformer architecture, to solve the traffic assignment problem. Traditional methods based on mathematical programs under the Equilibrium principle are computationally intensive for large-scale networks. The proposed model directly predicts equilibrium path flows, capturing complex correlations between OD pairs for a detailed analysis. It significantly reduces computation time and can adapt to changing demand and network structures without requiring recalculations. Numerical experiments on various networks show that the model is much faster than traditional optimization methods. It accurately estimates path-level traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and improving prediction accuracy. The model's flexibility in handling varying demand and network conditions supports traffic management and enables rapid 'what-if' analyses for enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis, traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs. This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks, specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time, while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information. The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions, supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

Summary:
Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often evaluated on individual benchmarks, but these assessments may not fully capture the capabilities of the models. To address this limitation, the authors propose game-based evaluations to provide a more holistic assessment of MLMs. By using games like Dixit, a fantasy card game that requires players to generate captions to trick opponents, the authors demonstrate how such evaluations can offer a competitive and objective framework for assessing MLM capabilities. Through quantitative experiments involving five different MLMs, the authors show that Dixit win-rate rankings are highly correlated with rankings on popular MLM benchmarks. Furthermore, games between human and MLM players in Dixit reveal differences in agent strategies and areas for improvement in MLM reasoning. This approach offers a more engaging and robust way to evaluate the performance of MLMs compared to traditional benchmark assessments.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static, individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research (OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation. Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts. In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly, inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a 24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models, particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and interpretable LLM agents.

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices. However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets, enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes, offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper, we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work, we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines. Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40% while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at https://github.com/rle27/LyriCAR.

<title>A Tutorial on Cognitive Biases in Agentic AI-Driven 6G Autonomous Networks</title>

Abstract: The path to higher network autonomy in 6G lies beyond the mere optimization of key performance indicators (KPIs). While KPIs have enabled automation gains under TM Forum Levels 1--3, they remain numerical abstractions that act only as proxies for the real essence of communication networks: seamless connectivity, fairness, adaptability, and resilience. True autonomy requires perceiving and reasoning over the network environment as it is. Such progress can be achieved through \emph{agentic AI}, where large language model (LLM)-powered agents perceive multimodal telemetry, reason with memory, negotiate across domains, and act via APIs to achieve multi-objective goals. However, deploying such agents introduces the challenge of cognitive biases inherited from human design, which can distort reasoning, negotiation, tool use, and actuation. Between neuroscience and AI, this paper provides a tutorial on a selection of well-known biases, including their taxonomy, definition, mathematical formulation, emergence in telecom systems and the commonly impacted agentic components. The tutorial also presents various mitigation strategies tailored to each type of bias. The article finally provides two practical use-cases, which tackle the emergence, impact and mitigation gain of some famous biases in 6G inter-slice and cross-domain management. In particular, anchor randomization, temporal decay and inflection bonus techniques are introduced to specifically address anchoring, temporal and confirmation biases. This avoids that agents stick to the initial high resource allocation proposal or decisions that are recent and/or confirming a prior hypothesis. By grounding decisions in a richer and fairer set of past experiences, the quality and bravery of the agentic agreements in the second use-case, for instance, are leading to $\times 5$ lower latency and around $40\%$ higher energy saving.

<title>Revisiting Zeroth-Order Optimization: Minimum-Variance Two-Point Estimators and Directionally Aligned Perturbations</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using $\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional methods under specific conditions.

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources, and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents transformative opportunities for organizations, yet both midsize organizations and larger enterprises face distinctive adoption challenges. Midsize organizations encounter resource constraints and limited AI expertise, while enterprises struggle with organizational complexity and coordination challenges. Existing technology adoption frameworks, including TAM (Technology Acceptance Model), TOE (Technology Organization Environment), and DOI (Diffusion of Innovations) theory, lack the specificity required for GenAI implementation across these diverse contexts, creating a critical gap in adoption literature. This paper introduces FAIGMOE (Framework for the Adoption and Integration of Generative AI in Midsize Organizations and Enterprises), a conceptual framework addressing the unique needs of both organizational types. FAIGMOE synthesizes technology adoption theory, organizational change management, and innovation diffusion perspectives into four interconnected phases: Strategic Assessment, Planning and Use Case Development, Implementation and Integration, and Operationalization and Optimization. Each phase provides scalable guidance on readiness assessment, strategic alignment, risk governance, technical architecture, and change management adaptable to organizational scale and complexity. The framework incorporates GenAI specific considerations including prompt engineering, model orchestration, and hallucination management that distinguish it from generic technology adoption frameworks. As a perspective contribution, FAIGMOE provides the first comprehensive conceptual framework explicitly addressing GenAI adoption across midsize and enterprise organizations, offering actionable implementation protocols, assessment instruments, and governance templates requiring empirical validation through future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making, including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help. Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency, explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically meaningful LLMs.

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich, moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized, high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window, insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges, this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora, emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT. Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models significantly outperform existing baselines.

Abstract: Social choice theory offers a wealth of approaches for selecting a candidate on behalf of voters based on their reported preference rankings over options. When voters have underlying utilities for these options, however, using preference rankings may lead to suboptimal outcomes vis-\`a-vis utilitarian social welfare. Distortion is a measure of this suboptimality, and provides a worst-case approach for developing and analyzing voting rules when utilities have minimal structure. However in many settings, such as common paradigms for value alignment, alternatives admit a vector representation, and it is natural to suppose that utilities are parametric functions thereof. We undertake the first study of distortion for linear utility functions. Specifically, we investigate the distortion of linear social choice for deterministic and randomized voting rules. We obtain bounds that depend only on the dimension of the candidate embedding, and are independent of the numbers of candidates or voters. Additionally, we introduce poly-time instance-optimal algorithms for minimizing distortion given a collection of candidates and votes. We empirically evaluate these in two real-world domains: recommendation systems using collaborative filtering embeddings, and opinion surveys utilizing language model embeddings, benchmarking several standard rules against our instance-optimal algorithms.

Abstract: Since its 2009 genesis block, the Bitcoin network has processed \num{>1.08} billion (B) transactions representing \num{>8.72}B BTC, offering rich potential for machine learning (ML); yet, its pseudonymity and obscured flow of funds inherent in its \utxo-based design, have rendered this data largely inaccessible for ML research. Addressing this gap, we present an ML-compatible graph modeling the Bitcoin's economic topology by reconstructing the flow of funds. This temporal, heterogeneous graph encompasses complete transaction history up to block \cutoffHeight, consisting of \num{>2.4}B nodes and \num{>39.72}B edges. Additionally, we provide custom sampling methods yielding node and edge feature vectors of sampled communities, tools to load and analyze the Bitcoin graph data within specialized graph databases, and ready-to-use database snapshots. This comprehensive dataset and toolkit empower the ML community to tackle Bitcoin's intricate ecosystem at scale, driving progress in applications such as anomaly detection, address classification, market analysis, and large-scale graph ML benchmarking.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots are increasingly used for opinion exploration. Prior research examined how LLMs alter user views, yet little work extended beyond one-way influence to address how user input can affect LLM responses and how such bi-directional influence manifests throughout the multi-turn conversations. This study investigates this dynamic through 50 controversial-topic discussions with participants (N=266) across three conditions: static statements, standard chatbot, and personalized chatbot. Results show that human opinions barely shifted, while LLM outputs changed more substantially, narrowing the gap between human and LLM stance. Personalization amplified these shifts in both directions compared to the standard setting. Analysis of multi-turn conversations further revealed that exchanges involving participants' personal stories were most likely to trigger stance changes for both humans and LLMs. Our work highlights the risk of over-alignment in human-LLM interaction and the need for careful design of personalized chatbots to more thoughtfully and stably align with users.

Abstract: Efficient energy management is essential for reliable and sustainable microgrid operation amid increasing renewable integration. This paper proposes an imitation learning-based framework to approximate mixed-integer Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) for microgrid energy management. The proposed method trains a neural network to imitate expert EMPC control actions from offline trajectories, enabling fast, real-time decision making without solving optimization problems online. To enhance robustness and generalization, the learning process includes noise injection during training to mitigate distribution shift and explicitly incorporates forecast uncertainty in renewable generation and demand. Simulation results demonstrate that the learned policy achieves economic performance comparable to EMPC while only requiring $10\%$ of the computation time of optimization-based EMPC in practice.

Abstract: AI systems have the potential to produce both benefits and harms, but without rigorous and ongoing adversarial evaluation, AI actors will struggle to assess the breadth and magnitude of the AI risk surface. Researchers from the field of systems design have developed several effective sociotechnical AI evaluation and red teaming techniques targeting bias, hate speech, mis/disinformation, and other documented harm classes. However, as increasingly sophisticated AI systems are released into high-stakes sectors (such as education, healthcare, and intelligence-gathering), our current evaluation and monitoring methods are proving less and less capable of delivering effective oversight.
  In order to actually deliver responsible AI and to ensure AI's harms are fully understood and its security vulnerabilities mitigated, pioneering new approaches to close this "responsibility gap" are now more urgent than ever. In this paper, we propose one such approach, the cooperative public AI red-teaming exercise, and discuss early results of its prior pilot implementations. This approach is intertwined with CAMLIS itself: the first in-person public demonstrator exercise was held in conjunction with CAMLIS 2024. We review the operational design and results of this exercise, the prior National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s Assessing the Risks and Impacts of AI (ARIA) pilot exercise, and another similar exercise conducted with the Singapore Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). Ultimately, we argue that this approach is both capable of delivering meaningful results and is also scalable to many AI developing jurisdictions.

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE) methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency. At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework, which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and causal fidelity of time series explanations.

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text, there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e., divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways. We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other - whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline. Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations on the circle. Our main contributions stem from observing an exact equivalence between solutions of the stationary McKean-Vlasov equation and an infinite-dimensional quadratic system of equations over Fourier coefficients, which allows explicit characterization of the stationary states in a sequence space rather than a function space. This framework provides a transparent description of local bifurcations, characterizing their periodicity, and resonance structures, while accommodating singular potentials. We derive analytic expressions that characterize the emergence, form and shape (supercritical, critical, subcritical or transcritical) of bifurcations involving possibly multiple Fourier modes and connect them with discontinuous phase transitions. We also characterize, under suitable assumptions, the detailed structure of the stationary bifurcating solutions that are accurate upto an arbitrary number of Fourier modes. At the global level, we establish regularity and concavity properties of the free energy landscape, proving existence, compactness, and coexistence of globally minimizing stationary measures, further identifying discontinuous phase transitions with points of non-differentiability of the minimum free energy map. As an application, we specialize the theory to the Noisy Mean-Field Transformer model, where we show how changing the inverse temperature parameter $\beta$ affects the geometry of the infinitely many bifurcations from the uniform measure. We also explain how increasing $\beta$ can lead to a rich class of approximate multi-mode stationary solutions which can be seen as `metastable states'. Further, a sharp transition from continuous to discontinuous (first-order) phase behavior is observed as $\beta$ increases.

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER (Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets, and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM tokens.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite advances in safety alignment, remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks designed to circumvent protective mechanisms. Prevailing defense strategies rely on external interventions, such as input filtering or output modification, which often lack generalizability and compromise model utility while incurring significant computational overhead. In this work, we introduce a new, training-free defense paradigm, Self-Activating Internal Defense (SAID), which reframes the defense task from external correction to internal capability activation. SAID uniquely leverages the LLM's own reasoning abilities to proactively identify and neutralize malicious intent through a three-stage pipeline: model-native intent distillation to extract core semantics, optimal safety prefix probing to activate latent safety awareness, and a conservative aggregation strategy to ensure robust decision-making. Extensive experiments on five open-source LLMs against six advanced jailbreak attacks demonstrate that SAID substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in reducing harmful outputs. Crucially, it achieves this while preserving model performance on benign tasks and incurring minimal computational overhead. Our work establishes that activating the intrinsic safety mechanisms of LLMs is a more robust and scalable path toward building safer and more reliable aligned AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data, leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output. The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover, the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA and 3D Chairs dataset.

Abstract: The increasing scale of large language models (LLMs) necessitates highly efficient collective communication frameworks, particularly as training workloads extend to hundreds of thousands of GPUs. Traditional communication methods face significant throughput and latency limitations at this scale, hindering both the development and deployment of state-of-the-art models. This paper presents the NCCLX collective communication framework, developed at Meta, engineered to optimize performance across the full LLM lifecycle, from the synchronous demands of large-scale training to the low-latency requirements of inference. The framework is designed to support complex workloads on clusters exceeding 100,000 GPUs, ensuring reliable, high-throughput, and low-latency data exchange. Empirical evaluation on the Llama4 model demonstrates substantial improvements in communication efficiency. This research contributes a robust solution for enabling the next generation of LLMs to operate at unprecedented scales.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table understanding.

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost. To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a `play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer computational costs. Codes are available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/cocowy1/PPMStereo}.

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification, geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions, requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration. Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126 analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15). While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall (0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will require integration of multi-modal data sources.

<title>Automated Cloud Infrastructure-as-Code Reconciliation with AI Agents</title>

Abstract: Cloud infrastructure is managed through a mix of interfaces -- traditionally, cloud consoles, command-line interfaces (CLI), and SDKs are the tools of choice. Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have quickly gained popularity. Unlike conventional tools, IaC~frameworks encode the infrastructure in a "source-of-truth" configuration. They are capable of automatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating, or destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment with the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs, or SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure drift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may undo valid updates or trigger errors.
  We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates out-of-band changes back into the IaC program. Our key insight is that infrastructure changes eventually all occur via cloud API invocations -- the lowest layer for cloud management operations. NSync gleans insights from API traces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update the IaC configuration to capture the changes). It employs an agentic architecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API sequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and continually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past reconciliations. We further introduce a novel evaluation pipeline for injecting realistic drifts into cloud infrastructure and assessing reconciliation performance. Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372 drift scenarios show that NSync outperforms the baseline both in terms of accuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47$\times$ improvement).

Abstract: The ability to model interactions among agents is crucial for effective coordination and understanding their cooperation mechanisms in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, previous efforts to model high-order interactions have been primarily hindered by the combinatorial explosion or the opaque nature of their black-box network structures. In this paper, we propose a novel value decomposition framework, called Continued Fraction Q-Learning (QCoFr), which can flexibly capture arbitrary-order agent interactions with only linear complexity $\mathcal{O}\left({n}\right)$ in the number of agents, thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion when modeling rich cooperation. Furthermore, we introduce the variational information bottleneck to extract latent information for estimating credits. This latent information helps agents filter out noisy interactions, thereby significantly enhancing both cooperation and interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QCoFr not only consistently achieves better performance but also provides interpretability that aligns with our theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Portfolio managers rely on correlation-based analysis and heuristic methods that fail to capture true causal relationships driving performance. We present a hybrid framework that integrates statistical causal discovery algorithms with domain knowledge from two complementary sources: a financial knowledge graph extracted from SEC 10-K filings and large language model reasoning. Our approach systematically enhances three representative causal discovery paradigms, constraint-based (PC), score-based (GES), and continuous optimization (NOTEARS), by encoding knowledge graph constraints algorithmically and leveraging LLM conceptual reasoning for hypothesis generation. Evaluated on a synthetic financial dataset of 500 firms across 18 variables, our KG+LLM-enhanced methods demonstrate consistent improvements across all three algorithms: PC (F1: 0.622 vs. 0.459 baseline, +36%), GES (F1: 0.735 vs. 0.367, +100%), and NOTEARS (F1: 0.759 vs. 0.163, +366%). The framework enables reliable scenario analysis with mean absolute error of 0.003610 for counterfactual predictions and perfect directional accuracy for intervention effects. It also addresses critical limitations of existing methods by grounding statistical discoveries in financial domain expertise while maintaining empirical validation, providing portfolio managers with the causal foundation necessary for proactive risk management and strategic decision-making in dynamic market environments.

Abstract: In real-world time series forecasting tasks, category information plays a pivotal role in capturing inherent data patterns. This paper introduces QKCV (Query-Key-Category-Value) attention, an extension of the traditional QKV framework that incorporates a static categorical embedding C to emphasize category-specific information. As a versatile plug-in module, QKCV enhances the forecasting accuracy of attention-based models (e.g., Vanilla Transformer, Informer, PatchTST, TFT) across diverse real-world datasets. Furthermore, QKCV demonstrates remarkable adaptability in fine-tuning univariate time series foundation model by solely updating the static embedding C while preserving pretrained weights, thereby reducing computational overhead and achieving superior fine-tuning performance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD). MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

<title>Why LVLMs Are More Prone to Hallucinations in Longer Responses: The Role of Context</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism? After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses. Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress" framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases, and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly, re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion. From a game-theoretic perspective, we reformulate max-min multi-objective reinforcement learning as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the proposed algorithm with adaptive regularization. Our experiments demonstrate the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm in tabular settings, and our implementation for deep reinforcement learning significantly outperforms previous baselines in many MORL environments.

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes) and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective clinical decision making.

However, few practical approaches achieve the gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration -- often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking. Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal oracle behavior more closely.

Abstract: This article presents early findings from designing, deploying and evaluating an AI-based educational agent deployed as the primary instructor in a graduate-level Cloud Computing course at IISc. We detail the design of a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Instructor Agent, and introduce a pedagogical framework that integrates the Instructor Agent into the course workflow for actively interacting with the students for content delivery, supplemented by the human instructor to offer the course structure and undertake question--answer sessions. We also propose an analytical framework that evaluates the Agent--Student interaction transcripts using interpretable engagement metrics of topic coverage, topic depth and turn-level elaboration. We report early experiences on how students interact with the Agent to explore concepts, clarify doubts and sustain inquiry-driven dialogue during live classroom sessions. We also report preliminary analysis on our evaluation metrics applied across two successive instructional modules that reveals patterns of engagement evolution, transitioning from broad conceptual exploration to deeper, focused inquiry. These demonstrate how structured integration of conversational AI agents can foster reflective learning, offer a reproducible methodology for studying engagement in authentic classroom settings, and support scalable, high-quality higher education.

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3) PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially, ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity). Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to $1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

Abstract: Large Vision Language models have seen huge application in several sports use-cases recently. Most of these works have been targeted towards a limited subset of popular sports like soccer, cricket, basketball etc; focusing on generative tasks like visual question answering, highlight generation. This work analyzes the applicability of the modern video foundation models (both encoder and decoder) for a very niche but hugely popular dance sports - breakdance. Our results show that Video Encoder models continue to outperform state-of-the-art Video Language Models for prediction tasks. We provide insights on how to choose the encoder model and provide a thorough analysis into the workings of a finetuned decoder model for breakdance video classification.

Abstract: We present a winning solution to RoboSense 2025 Track 4: Cross-Modal Drone Navigation. The task retrieves the most relevant geo-referenced image from a large multi-platform corpus (satellite/drone/ground) given a natural-language query. Two obstacles are severe inter-platform heterogeneity and a domain gap between generic training descriptions and platform-specific test queries. We mitigate these with a domain-aligned preprocessing pipeline and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework: (i) platform-wise partitioning, satellite augmentation, and removal of orientation words; (ii) an LLM-based caption refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative mining strategy to enhance discriminative power, and fuse their scores at inference. The system tops the official leaderboard, demonstrating robust cross-modal geo-localization under heterogeneous viewpoints.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as one of the most prominent applications of vector databases. By integrating documents retrieved from a database into the prompt of a large language model (LLM), RAG enables more reliable and informative content generation. While there has been extensive research on vector databases, many open research problems remain once they are considered in the wider context of end-to-end RAG pipelines. One practical yet challenging problem is how to jointly optimize both system performance and generation quality in RAG, which is significantly more complex than it appears due to the numerous knobs on both the algorithmic side (spanning models and databases) and the systems side (from software to hardware). In this paper, we present RAG-Stack, a three-pillar blueprint for quality-performance co-optimization in RAG systems. RAG-Stack comprises: (1) RAG-IR, an intermediate representation that serves as an abstraction layer to decouple quality and performance aspects; (2) RAG-CM, a cost model for estimating system performance given an RAG-IR; and (3) RAG-PE, a plan exploration algorithm that searches for high-quality, high-performance RAG configurations. We believe this three-pillar blueprint will become the de facto paradigm for RAG quality-performance co-optimization in the years to come.

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

Abstract: With the wide application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques in complex fields such as autonomous driving, intelligent manufacturing, and smart healthcare, how to improve its security and robustness in dynamic and changeable environments has become a core issue in current research. Especially in the face of adversarial attacks, DRL may suffer serious performance degradation or even make potentially dangerous decisions, so it is crucial to ensure their stability in security-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, we first introduce the basic framework of DRL and analyze the main security challenges faced in complex and changing environments. In addition, this paper proposes an adversarial attack classification framework based on perturbation type and attack target and reviews the mainstream adversarial attack methods against DRL in detail, including various attack methods such as perturbation state space, action space, reward function and model space. To effectively counter the attacks, this paper systematically summarizes various current robustness training strategies, including adversarial training, competitive training, robust learning, adversarial detection, defense distillation and other related defense techniques, we also discuss the advantages and shortcomings of these methods in improving the robustness of DRL. Finally, this paper looks into the future research direction of DRL in adversarial environments, emphasizing the research needs in terms of improving generalization, reducing computational complexity, and enhancing scalability and explainability, aiming to provide valuable references and directions for researchers.

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at https://github.com/anonymifish/lego-rec-multiple-attribute-unlearning.

Abstract: Humans routinely rely on memory to perform tasks, yet most robot policies lack this capability; our goal is to endow robot policies with the same ability. Naively conditioning on long observation histories is computationally expensive and brittle under covariate shift, while indiscriminate subsampling of history leads to irrelevant or redundant information. We propose a hierarchical policy framework, where the high-level policy is trained to select and track previous relevant keyframes from its experience. The high-level policy uses selected keyframes and the most recent frames when generating text instructions for a low-level policy to execute. This design is compatible with existing vision-language-action (VLA) models and enables the system to efficiently reason over long-horizon dependencies. In our experiments, we finetune Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and $\pi_{0.5}$ as the high-level and low-level policies respectively, using demonstrations supplemented with minimal language annotations. Our approach, MemER, outperforms prior methods on three real-world long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks that require minutes of memory.

<title>GhostEI-Bench: Do Mobile Agents Resilience to Environmental Injection in Dynamic On-Device Environments?</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents to navigate mobile graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Operating in dynamic on-device ecosystems, which include notifications, pop-ups, and inter-app interactions, exposes them to a unique and underexplored threat vector: environmental injection. Unlike prompt-based attacks that manipulate textual instructions, environmental injection corrupts an agent's visual perception by inserting adversarial UI elements (for example, deceptive overlays or spoofed notifications) directly into the GUI. This bypasses textual safeguards and can derail execution, causing privacy leakage, financial loss, or irreversible device compromise. To systematically evaluate this threat, we introduce GhostEI-Bench, the first benchmark for assessing mobile agents under environmental injection attacks within dynamic, executable environments. Moving beyond static image-based assessments, GhostEI-Bench injects adversarial events into realistic application workflows inside fully operational Android emulators and evaluates performance across critical risk scenarios. We further propose a judge-LLM protocol that conducts fine-grained failure analysis by reviewing the agent's action trajectory alongside the corresponding screenshot sequence, pinpointing failure in perception, recognition, or reasoning. Comprehensive experiments on state-of-the-art agents reveal pronounced vulnerability to deceptive environmental cues: current models systematically fail to perceive and reason about manipulated UIs. GhostEI-Bench provides a framework for quantifying and mitigating this emerging threat, paving the way toward more robust and secure embodied agents.

Abstract: A reproducible deep learning framework is presented for surface metrology to predict surface texture parameters together with their reported standard uncertainties. Using a multi-instrument dataset spanning tactile and optical systems, measurement system type classification is addressed alongside coordinated regression of Ra, Rz, RONt and their uncertainty targets (Ra_uncert, Rz_uncert, RONt_uncert). Uncertainty is modelled via quantile and heteroscedastic heads with post-hoc conformal calibration to yield calibrated intervals. On a held-out set, high fidelity was achieved by single-target regressors (R2: Ra 0.9824, Rz 0.9847, RONt 0.9918), with two uncertainty targets also well modelled (Ra_uncert 0.9899, Rz_uncert 0.9955); RONt_uncert remained difficult (R2 0.4934). The classifier reached 92.85% accuracy and probability calibration was essentially unchanged after temperature scaling (ECE 0.00504 -> 0.00503 on the test split). Negative transfer was observed for naive multi-output trunks, with single-target models performing better. These results provide calibrated predictions suitable to inform instrument selection and acceptance decisions in metrological workflows.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters (CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT (Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality, code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness, yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and 50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines. The models and code are available at: https://github.com/ChengpengLi1003/CoRT.

Abstract: W.J.T. Mitchell's influential essay 'What do pictures want?' shifts the theoretical focus away from the interpretative act of understanding pictures and from the motivations of the humans who create them to the possibility that the picture itself is an entity with agency and wants. In this article, I reframe Mitchell's question in light of contemporary AI image generation tools to ask: what do AI-generated images want? Drawing from art historical discourse on the nature of abstraction, I argue that AI-generated images want specificity and concreteness because they are fundamentally abstract. Multimodal text-to-image models, which are the primary subject of this article, are based on the premise that text and image are interchangeable or exchangeable tokens and that there is a commensurability between them, at least as represented mathematically in data. The user pipeline that sees textual input become visual output, however, obscures this representational regress and makes it seem like one form transforms into the other -- as if by magic.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income, Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized, performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization. We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM assessments.

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens. Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

Abstract: Cloud computing has established itself as the support for the vast majority of emerging technologies, mainly due to the characteristic of elasticity it offers. Auto-scalers are the systems that enable this elasticity by acquiring and releasing resources on demand to ensure an agreed service level. In this article we present FLAS (Forecasted Load Auto-Scaling), an auto-scaler for distributed services that combines the advantages of proactive and reactive approaches according to the situation to decide the optimal scaling actions in every moment. The main novelties introduced by FLAS are (i) a predictive model of the high-level metrics trend which allows to anticipate changes in the relevant SLA parameters (e.g. performance metrics such as response time or throughput) and (ii) a reactive contingency system based on the estimation of high-level metrics from resource use metrics, reducing the necessary instrumentation (less invasive) and allowing it to be adapted agnostically to different applications. We provide a FLAS implementation for the use case of a content-based publish-subscribe middleware (E-SilboPS) that is the cornerstone of an event-driven architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first auto-scaling system for content-based publish-subscribe distributed systems (although it is generic enough to fit any distributed service). Through an evaluation based on several test cases recreating not only the expected contexts of use, but also the worst possible scenarios (following the Boundary-Value Analysis or BVA test methodology), we have validated our approach and demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution by ensuring compliance with performance requirements over 99% of the time.

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on centralization versus specialization.

<title>Dynamic Weight Adjustment for Knowledge Distillation: Leveraging Vision Transformer for High-Accuracy Lung Cancer Detection and Real-Time Deployment</title>

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights, our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic, enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model, which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet, enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000 histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images (99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

Abstract: The development of neural audio codecs (NACs) has largely promoted applications of language models (LMs) to speech processing and understanding. However, there lacks the verification on the effectiveness of autoregressive (AR) LMbased models in unifying different sub-tasks of speech enhancement (SE). In this work, we propose UniSE, a unified decoder-only LM-based framework to handle different SE tasks including speech restoration, target speaker extraction and speech separation. It takes input speech features as conditions and generates discrete tokens of the target speech using AR modeling, which facilitates a compatibility between distinct learning patterns of multiple tasks. Experiments on several benchmarks indicate the proposed UniSE can achieve competitive performance compared to discriminative and generative baselines, showing the capacity of LMs in unifying SE tasks. The demo page is available here: https://github.com/hyyan2k/UniSE.

<title>MolBridge: Atom-Level Joint Graph Refinement for Robust Drug-Drug Interaction Event Prediction</title>

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios. patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing drug-drug interaction networks.

<title>Symbolic Regression and Differentiable Fits in Beyond the Standard Model Physics</title>

Abstract: We demonstrate the efficacy of symbolic regression (SR) to probe models of particle physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), by considering the so-called Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM). Like many incarnations of BSM physics this model has a number (four) of arbitrary parameters, which determine the experimental signals, and cosmological observables such as the dark matter relic density. We show that analysis of the phenomenology can be greatly accelerated by using symbolic expressions derived for the observables in terms of the input parameters. Here we focus on the Higgs mass, the cold dark matter relic density, and the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We find that SR can produce remarkably accurate expressions. Using them we make global fits to derive the posterior probability densities of the CMSSM input parameters which are in good agreement with those performed using conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate a major advantage of SR which is the ability to make fits using differentiable methods rather than sampling methods. We also compare the method with neural network (NN) regression. SR produces more globally robust results, while NNs require data that is focussed on the promising regions in order to be equally performant.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks, questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and further resources are publicly available.

Abstract: There has recently been a major advance with respect to how information fusion is performed. Information fusion has gone from being conceived as a purely hierarchical procedure, as is the case of traditional military applications, to now being regarded collaboratively, as holonic fusion, which is better suited for civil applications and edge organizations. The above paradigm shift is being boosted as information fusion gains ground in different non-military areas, and human-computer and machine-machine communications, where holarchies, which are more flexible structures than ordinary, static hierarchies, become more widespread. This paper focuses on showing how holonic structures tend to be generated when there are constraints on resources (energy, available messages, time, etc.) for interactions based on a set of fully intercommunicating elements (peers) whose components fuse information as a means of optimizing the impact of vagueness and uncertainty present message exchanges. Holon formation is studied generically based on a multiagent system model, and an example of its possible operation is shown. Holonic structures have a series of advantages, such as adaptability, to sudden changes in the environment or its composition, are somewhat autonomous and are capable of cooperating in order to achieve a common goal. This can be useful when the shortage of resources prevents communications or when the system components start to fail.

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for evolving LLMs.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework. Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model. Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact events.

<title>Steering Evaluation-Aware Language Models To Act Like They Are Deployed</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act like they are deployed.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA (text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1 gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and (3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency and auditability.

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress, current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries, leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper, we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR. A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context (Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa) framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation. Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks, FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder, which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically $x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder , fine-tuning dataset and pretrained models are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/kyutai/arc-encoders-68ee18787301407d60a57047 .

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed," are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720 comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning. Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to pattern matching.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and (ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA. GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM and F1.

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

Abstract: Existing defence mechanisms have demonstrated significant effectiveness in mitigating rule-based Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, leveraging predefined signatures and static heuristics to identify and block malicious traffic. However, the emergence of AI-driven techniques presents new challenges to SDN security, potentially compromising the efficacy of existing defence mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce~AdaDoS, an adaptive attack model that disrupt network operations while evading detection by existing DoS-based detectors through adversarial reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, AdaDoS models the problem as a competitive game between an attacker, whose goal is to obstruct network traffic without being detected, and a detector, which aims to identify malicious traffic. AdaDoS can solve this game by dynamically adjusting its attack strategy based on feedback from the SDN and the detector. Additionally, recognising that attackers typically have less information than defenders, AdaDoS formulates the DoS-like attack as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP), with the attacker having access only to delay information between attacker and victim nodes. We address this challenge with a novel reciprocal learning module, where the student agent, with limited observations, enhances its performance by learning from the teacher agent, who has full observational capabilities in the SDN environment. AdaDoS represents the first application of RL to develop DoS-like attack sequences, capable of adaptively evading both machine learning-based and rule-based DoS-like attack detectors.

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3 have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers, allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets, STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision. On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance, raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and improving answer reliability.

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift, unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Achieving immersive auditory experiences in virtual environments requires flexible sound modeling that supports dynamic source positions. In this paper, we introduce a task called resounding, which aims to estimate room impulse responses at arbitrary emitter location from a sparse set of measured emitter positions, analogous to the relighting problem in vision. We leverage the reciprocity property and introduce Versa, a physics-inspired approach to facilitating acoustic field learning. Our method creates physically valid samples with dense virtual emitter positions by exchanging emitter and listener poses. We also identify challenges in deploying reciprocity due to emitter/listener gain patterns and propose a self-supervised learning approach to address them. Results show that Versa substantially improve the performance of acoustic field learning on both simulated and real-world datasets across different metrics. Perceptual user studies show that Versa can greatly improve the immersive spatial sound experience. Code, dataset and demo videos are available on the project website: https://waves.seas.upenn.edu/projects/versa.

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging, particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines, consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory and runtime.

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM). We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to generalize to larger and more complex problems.

<title>Practical Code RAG at Scale: Task-Aware Retrieval Design Choices under Compute Budgets</title>

Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i) chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity. (1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3 family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational efficiency.

We investigated the effec- tiveness of three pre-trained transformer mod- els: AraELECTRA, CAMeLBERT, and XLM- RoBERTa. Our approach involved fine-tuning each model on the provided dataset for a binary classification task. Our findings revealed a sur- prising result: the multilingual XLM-RoBERTa model achieved the highest performance with an F1 score of 0.7701, outperforming the spe- cialized Arabic models. This work underscores the complexities of AI-generated text detection and highlights the strong generalization capa- bilities of multilingual models.

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms, and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent, model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly adopted as critical tools for accelerating innovation. This paper identifies and formalizes a systemic risk inherent in this paradigm: \textbf{Black Box Absorption}. We define this as the process by which the opaque internal architectures of LLM platforms, often operated by large-scale service providers, can internalize, generalize, and repurpose novel concepts contributed by users during interaction. This mechanism threatens to undermine the foundational principles of innovation economics by creating severe informational and structural asymmetries between individual creators and platform operators, thereby jeopardizing the long-term sustainability of the innovation ecosystem. To analyze this challenge, we introduce two core concepts: the idea unit, representing the transportable functional logic of an innovation, and idea safety, a multidimensional standard for its protection. This paper analyzes the mechanisms of absorption and proposes a concrete governance and engineering agenda to mitigate these risks, ensuring that creator contributions remain traceable, controllable, and equitable.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare, structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis, censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical care.

By leveraging ML algorithms, this study introduces predictive models that are designed to enhance operational efficiency in quantum computing systems. Using a dataset of about 150,000 jobs that follow the IBM Quantum schema, we employ ML methods based on Gradient-Boosting (LightGBM) to predict the QPU processing times, incorporating data preprocessing methods to improve model accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of ML in forecasting quantum jobs. This improvement can have implications on improving resource management and scheduling within quantum computing frameworks. This research not only highlights the potential of ML in refining quantum job predictions but also sets a foundation for integrating AI-driven tools in advanced quantum computing operations.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260 studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper, starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments. We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical, scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's language reasoning.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, practitioners face increasing options for enhancing inference-time performance without model retraining, including budget tuning and multi-step techniques like self-reflection. While these methods improve output quality, they create complex trade-offs among accuracy, cost, and latency that remain poorly understood across different domains. This paper systematically compares self-reflection and budget tuning across mathematical reasoning and translation tasks. We evaluate prominent LLMs, including Anthropic Claude, Amazon Nova, and Mistral families, along with other models under varying reflection depths and compute budgets to derive Pareto optimal performance frontiers. Our analysis reveals substantial domain dependent variation in self-reflection effectiveness, with performance gains up to 220\% in mathematical reasoning. We further investigate how reflection round depth and feedback mechanism quality influence performance across model families. To validate our findings in a real-world setting, we deploy a self-reflection enhanced marketing content localisation system at Lounge by Zalando, where it shows market-dependent effectiveness, reinforcing the importance of domain specific evaluation when deploying these techniques. Our results provide actionable guidance for selecting optimal inference strategies given specific domains and resource constraints. We open source our self-reflection implementation for reproducibility at https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-genai-reflection-for-bedrock.

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem. Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and note embeddings are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GRACE-F8E1/.

<title>R2-SVC: Towards Real-World Robust and Expressive Zero-shot Singing Voice Conversion</title>

Abstract: In real-world singing voice conversion (SVC) applications, environmental noise and the demand for expressive output pose significant challenges. Conventional methods, however, are typically designed without accounting for real deployment scenarios, as both training and inference usually rely on clean data. This mismatch hinders practical use, given the inevitable presence of diverse noise sources and artifacts from music separation. To tackle these issues, we propose R2-SVC, a robust and expressive SVC framework. First, we introduce simulation-based robustness enhancement through random fundamental frequency ($F_0$) perturbations and music separation artifact simulations (e.g., reverberation, echo), substantially improving performance under noisy conditions. Second, we enrich speaker representation using domain-specific singing data: alongside clean vocals, we incorporate DNSMOS-filtered separated vocals and public singing corpora, enabling the model to preserve speaker timbre while capturing singing style nuances. Third, we integrate the Neural Source-Filter (NSF) model to explicitly represent harmonic and noise components, enhancing the naturalness and controllability of converted singing. R2-SVC achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple SVC benchmarks under both clean and noisy conditions.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments. Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings. Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs. Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input, extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113 recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings. Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall, Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

<title>Neural Diversity Regularizes Hallucinations in Small Models</title>

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters, compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically, causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

Abstract: Cloud computing is ubiquitous, with a growing number of services being hosted on the cloud every day. Typical cloud compute systems allow administrators to write policies implementing access control rules which specify how access to private data is governed. These policies must be manually written, and due to their complexity can often be error prone. Moreover, existing policies often implement complex access control specifications and thus can be difficult to precisely analyze in determining their behavior works exactly as intended. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in automated code synthesis and summarization. Given this success, they could potentially be used for automatically generating access control policies or aid in understanding existing policies. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of LLMs for access control policy synthesis and summarization. Specifically, we first investigate diverse LLMs for access control policy synthesis, finding that: although LLMs can effectively generate syntactically correct policies, they have permissiveness issues, generating policies equivalent to the given specification 45.8% of the time for non-reasoning LLMs, and 93.7% of the time for reasoning LLMs. We then investigate how LLMs can be used to analyze policies by introducing a novel semantic-based request summarization approach which leverages LLMs to generate a precise characterization of the requests allowed by a policy. Our results show that while there are significant hurdles in leveraging LLMs for automated policy generation, LLMs show promising results when combined with symbolic approaches in analyzing existing policies.

Abstract: We introduce M2VN: Multi-Modal Volatility Network, a novel deep learning-based framework for financial volatility forecasting that unifies time series features with unstructured news data. M2VN leverages the representational power of deep neural networks to address two key challenges in this domain: (i) aligning and fusing heterogeneous data modalities, numerical financial data and textual information, and (ii) mitigating look-ahead bias that can undermine the validity of financial models. To achieve this, M2VN combines open-source market features with news embeddings generated by Time Machine GPT, a recently introduced point-in-time LLM, ensuring temporal integrity. An auxiliary alignment loss is introduced to enhance the integration of structured and unstructured data within the deep learning architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that M2VN consistently outperforms existing baselines, underscoring its practical value for risk management and financial decision-making in dynamic markets.

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled adaptable and agile quadruped locomotion; however, policies often converge to a single gait, leading to suboptimal performance. Traditionally, Model Predictive Control (MPC) has been extensively used to obtain task-specific optimal policies but lacks the ability to adapt to varying environments. To address these limitations, we propose an optimization framework for real-time gait adaptation in a continuous gait space, combining the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) algorithm with a Dreamer module to produce adaptive and optimal policies for quadruped locomotion. At each time step, MPPI jointly optimizes the actions and gait variables using a learned Dreamer reward that promotes velocity tracking, energy efficiency, stability, and smooth transitions, while penalizing abrupt gait changes. A learned value function is incorporated as terminal reward, extending the formulation to an infinite-horizon planner. We evaluate our framework in simulation on the Unitree Go1, demonstrating an average reduction of up to 36.48\% in energy consumption across varying target speeds, while maintaining accurate tracking and adaptive, task-appropriate gaits.

<title>Unsupervised Anomaly Prediction with N-BEATS and Graph Neural Network in Multi-variate Semiconductor Process Time Series</title>

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages: (a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies, and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

<title>User Perceptions of Privacy and Helpfulness in LLM Responses to Privacy-Sensitive Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records, contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g., leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further, we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users' perceived privacy and utility.

<title>Automated Extraction of Fluoropyrimidine Treatment and Treatment-Related Toxicities from Clinical Notes Using Natural Language Processing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20727</link>

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting). Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1 scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum Linear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis strings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL) equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented within TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that supports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow reasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason, edit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf. Within this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates the problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics into rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and the induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with nondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ and $n\le6$ qubits, systematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic logical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$ at $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring structures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities for all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue degeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal controlled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts diagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale, combining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction. It yields reproducible code constructions, supports targeted extensions to larger $K$ and higher distances, and leads toward data-driven classification.

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy, ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence. While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of compute or data scale.

Abstract: We present Empathic Prompting, a novel framework for multimodal human-AI interaction that enriches Large Language Model (LLM) conversations with implicit non-verbal context. The system integrates a commercial facial expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them as contextual signals during prompting. Unlike traditional multimodal interfaces, empathic prompting requires no explicit user control; instead, it unobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for conversational and smoothness alignment. The architecture is modular and scalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules. We describe the system design, implemented through a locally deployed DeepSeek instance, and report a preliminary service and usability evaluation (N=5). Results show consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with participants highlighting conversational fluidity. Beyond this proof of concept, empathic prompting points to applications in chatbot-mediated communication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where users' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates how reinforcement learning can explain two puzzling empirical patterns in household consumption behavior during economic downturns. I develop a model where agents use Q-learning with neural network approximation to make consumption-savings decisions under income uncertainty, departing from standard rational expectations assumptions. The model replicates two key findings from recent literature: (1) unemployed households with previously low liquid assets exhibit substantially higher marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) out of stimulus transfers compared to high-asset households (0.50 vs 0.34), even when neither group faces borrowing constraints, consistent with Ganong et al. (2024); and (2) households with more past unemployment experiences maintain persistently lower consumption levels after controlling for current economic conditions, a "scarring" effect documented by Malmendier and Shen (2024). Unlike existing explanations based on belief updating about income risk or ex-ante heterogeneity, the reinforcement learning mechanism generates both higher MPCs and lower consumption levels simultaneously through value function approximation errors that evolve with experience. Simulation results closely match the empirical estimates, suggesting that adaptive learning through reinforcement learning provides a unifying framework for understanding how past experiences shape current consumption behavior beyond what current economic conditions would predict.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant architectural pattern to operationalize Large Language Model (LLM) usage in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) systems. However, this design is susceptible to poisoning attacks, and previously proposed defenses can fail for CTI contexts as cyber threat information is often completely new for emerging attacks, and sophisticated threat actors can mimic legitimate formats, terminology, and stylistic conventions. To address this issue, we propose that the robustness of modern RAG defenses can be accelerated by applying source credibility algorithms on corpora, using PageRank as an example. In our experiments, we demonstrate quantitatively that our algorithm applies a lower authority score to malicious documents while promoting trusted content, using the standardized MS MARCO dataset. We also demonstrate proof-of-concept performance of our algorithm on CTI documents and feeds.

Abstract: Large-scale and diverse datasets are vital for training robust robotic manipulation policies, yet existing data collection methods struggle to balance scale, diversity, and quality. Simulation offers scalability but suffers from sim-to-real gaps, while teleoperation yields high-quality demonstrations with limited diversity and high labor cost. We introduce FieldGen, a field-guided data generation framework that enables scalable, diverse, and high-quality real-world data collection with minimal human supervision. FieldGen decomposes manipulation into two stages: a pre-manipulation phase, allowing trajectory diversity, and a fine manipulation phase requiring expert precision. Human demonstrations capture key contact and pose information, after which an attraction field automatically generates diverse trajectories converging to successful configurations. This decoupled design combines scalable trajectory diversity with precise supervision. Moreover, FieldGen-Reward augments generated data with reward annotations to further enhance policy learning. Experiments demonstrate that policies trained with FieldGen achieve higher success rates and improved stability compared to teleoperation-based baselines, while significantly reducing human effort in long-term real-world data collection.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g., R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application (generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features), parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs, contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for the research community.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a transformative methodology in modern cosmology, providing powerful tools to extract meaningful physical information from complex astronomical datasets. This paper implements a novel Bayesian graph deep learning framework for estimating key cosmological parameters in a primordial magnetic field (PMF) cosmology directly from simulated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps. Our methodology utilizes DeepSphere, a spherical convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed to respect the spherical geometry of CMB data through HEALPix pixelization. To advance beyond deterministic point estimates and enable robust uncertainty quantification, we integrate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) into the framework, capturing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties that reflect the model confidence in its predictions. The proposed approach demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving $R^{2}$ scores exceeding 0.89 for the magnetic parameter estimation. We further obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates through post-hoc training techniques including Variance Scaling and GPNormal. This integrated DeepSphere-BNNs framework not only delivers accurate parameter estimation from CMB maps with PMF contributions but also provides reliable uncertainty quantification, providing the necessary tools for robust cosmological inference in the era of precision cosmology.

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of compression methods.

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i) Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected -- eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to 24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just 100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Machine learning has facilitated significant advancements across various robotics domains, including navigation, locomotion, and manipulation. Many such achievements have been driven by the extensive use of simulation as a critical tool for training and testing robotic systems prior to their deployment in real-world environments. However, simulations consist of abstractions and approximations that inevitably introduce discrepancies between simulated and real environments, known as the reality gap. These discrepancies significantly hinder the successful transfer of systems from simulation to the real world. Closing this gap remains one of the most pressing challenges in robotics. Recent advances in sim-to-real transfer have demonstrated promising results across various platforms, including locomotion, navigation, and manipulation. By leveraging techniques such as domain randomization, real-to-sim transfer, state and action abstractions, and sim-real co-training, many works have overcome the reality gap. However, challenges persist, and a deeper understanding of the reality gap's root causes and solutions is necessary. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the sim-to-real landscape, highlighting the causes, solutions, and evaluation metrics for the reality gap and sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K. By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large proprietary models or training pipelines.

Abstract: This paper presents GSWorld, a robust, photo-realistic simulator for robotics manipulation that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with physics engines. Our framework advocates "closing the loop" of developing manipulation policies with reproducible evaluation of policies learned from real-robot data and sim2real policy training without using real robots. To enable photo-realistic rendering of diverse scenes, we propose a new asset format, which we term GSDF (Gaussian Scene Description File), that infuses Gaussian-on-Mesh representation with robot URDF and other objects. With a streamlined reconstruction pipeline, we curate a database of GSDF that contains 3 robot embodiments for single-arm and bimanual manipulation, as well as more than 40 objects. Combining GSDF with physics engines, we demonstrate several immediate interesting applications: (1) learning zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action manipulation policy with photo-realistic rendering, (2) automated high-quality DAgger data collection for adapting policies to deployment environments, (3) reproducible benchmarking of real-robot manipulation policies in simulation, (4) simulation data collection by virtual teleoperation, and (5) zero-shot sim2real visual reinforcement learning.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in robot navigation lies in learning policies that generalize across diverse environments while conforming to the unique physical constraints and capabilities of a specific embodiment (e.g., quadrupeds can walk up stairs, but rovers cannot). We propose VAMOS, a hierarchical VLA that decouples semantic planning from embodiment grounding: a generalist planner learns from diverse, open-world data, while a specialist affordance model learns the robot's physical constraints and capabilities in safe, low-cost simulation. We enabled this separation by carefully designing an interface that lets a high-level planner propose candidate paths directly in image space that the affordance model then evaluates and re-ranks. Our real-world experiments show that VAMOS achieves higher success rates in both indoor and complex outdoor navigation than state-of-the-art model-based and end-to-end learning methods. We also show that our hierarchical design enables cross-embodied navigation across legged and wheeled robots and is easily steerable using natural language. Real-world ablations confirm that the specialist model is key to embodiment grounding, enabling a single high-level planner to be deployed across physically distinct wheeled and legged robots. Finally, this model significantly enhances single-robot reliability, achieving 3X higher success rates by rejecting physically infeasible plans. Website: https://vamos-vla.github.io/

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT), translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis. Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs), such as Voyager, promise open-ended competence in worlds such as Minecraft. However, when powered by open-weight LLMs they still falter on elementary tasks after domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose MindForge, a generative-agent framework for cultural lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural inter-agent communication; and (3) a multi-component memory system. Following the cultural learning framework, we test MindForge in both instructive and collaborative settings within Minecraft. In an instructive setting with GPT-4, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks yielding $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones and collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items than the Voyager baseline. Furthermore, in fully \textit{collaborative} settings, we find that the performance of two underachieving agents improves with more communication rounds, echoing the Condorcet Jury Theorem. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated cultural experiences.

Abstract: The ability to recognize patterns from examples and apply them to new ones is a primal ability for general intelligence, and is widely studied by psychology and AI researchers. Many benchmarks have been proposed to measure such ability for Large Language Models (LLMs); however, they focus on few-shot (usually <10) setting and lack evaluation for aggregating many pieces of information from long contexts. On the other hand, the ever-growing context length of LLMs have brought forth the novel paradigm of many-shot In-Context Learning (ICL), which addresses new tasks with hundreds to thousands of examples without expensive and inefficient fine-tuning. However, many-shot evaluations often focus on classification, and popular long-context LLM tasks such as Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) seldom require complicated intelligence for integrating many pieces of information. To fix the issues from both worlds, we propose MIR-Bench, the first many-shot in-context reasoning benchmark for pattern recognition that asks LLM to predict output via input-output examples from underlying functions with diverse data format. Based on MIR-Bench, we study many novel problems for many-shot in-context reasoning, and acquired many insightful findings including scaling effect, robustness, inductive vs. transductive reasoning, retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), coding for inductive reasoning, cross-domain generalizability, etc.

<title>Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly on mathematics and programming tasks. Similar to how traditional RL helps agents explore and learn new strategies, RLVR is believed to enable LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities beyond those of the corresponding base models. In this study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically probing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various model families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning benchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric. Surprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform their base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher pass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the observed reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model. Treating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that six popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in leveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that distillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and genuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that current RLVR methods have not yet realized the potential of RL to elicit truly novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This highlights the need for improved RL paradigms, such as continual scaling and multi-turn agent-environment interaction, to unlock this potential.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have proven effective for test-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. However, reward hacking issues with PRMs limit their successful application in reinforcement fine-tuning. In this paper, we identify the main cause of PRM-induced reward hacking: the canonical summation-form credit assignment in reinforcement learning (RL), which defines the value as cumulative gamma-decayed future rewards, easily induces LLMs to hack steps with high rewards. To address this, we propose PURE: Process sUpervised Reinforcement lEarning. The key innovation of PURE is a min-form credit assignment that formulates the value function as the minimum of future rewards. This method significantly alleviates reward hacking by limiting the value function range and distributing advantages more reasonably. Through extensive experiments on 3 base models, we show that PRM-based approaches enabling min-form credit assignment achieve comparable reasoning performance to verifiable reward-based methods within only 30% steps. In contrast, the canonical sum-form credit assignment collapses training even at the beginning! Additionally, when we supplement PRM-based fine-tuning with just 10% verifiable rewards, we further alleviate reward hacking and produce the best fine-tuned model based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B in our experiments, achieving 82.5% accuracy on AMC23 and 53.3% average accuracy across 5 benchmarks. Moreover, we summarize the observed reward hacking cases and analyze the causes of training collapse. We release our code and model weights at https://github.com/CJReinforce/PURE.

Abstract: The building thermodynamics model, which predicts real-time indoor temperature changes under potential HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) control operations, is crucial for optimizing HVAC control in buildings. While pioneering studies have attempted to develop such models for various building environments, these models often require extensive data collection periods and rely heavily on expert knowledge, making the modeling process inefficient and limiting the reusability of the models. This paper explores a model ensemble perspective that utilizes existing developed models as base models to serve a target building environment, thereby providing accurate predictions while reducing the associated efforts. Given that building data streams are non-stationary and the number of base models may increase, we propose a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approach to dynamically select and weight the base models. Our approach employs a two-tiered decision-making process: the high-level focuses on model selection, while the low-level determines the weights of the selected models. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach through offline experiments and an on-site case study, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a pillar of Trustworthy AI and aims to bring transparency in complex models that are opaque by nature. Despite the benefits of incorporating explanations in models, an urgent need is found in addressing the privacy concerns of providing this additional information to end users. In this article, we conduct a scoping review of existing literature to elicit details on the conflict between privacy and explainability. Using the standard methodology for scoping review, we extracted 57 articles from 1,943 studies published from January 2019 to December 2024. The review addresses 3 research questions to present readers with more understanding of the topic: (1) what are the privacy risks of releasing explanations in AI systems? (2) what current methods have researchers employed to achieve privacy preservation in XAI systems? (3) what constitutes a privacy preserving explanation? Based on the knowledge synthesized from the selected studies, we categorize the privacy risks and preservation methods in XAI and propose the characteristics of privacy preserving explanations to aid researchers and practitioners in understanding the requirements of XAI that is privacy compliant. Lastly, we identify the challenges in balancing privacy with other system desiderata and provide recommendations for achieving privacy preserving XAI. We expect that this review will shed light on the complex relationship of privacy and explainability, both being the fundamental principles of Trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become powerful tools for complex problem solving, but their structured reasoning pathways can lead to unsafe outputs when exposed to harmful prompts. Existing safety alignment methods reduce harmful outputs but can degrade reasoning depth, leading to significant trade-offs in complex, multi-step tasks, and remain vulnerable to sophisticated jailbreak attacks. To address this, we introduce SAFEPATH, a lightweight alignment method that fine-tunes LRMs to emit a short, 8-token Safety Primer at the start of their reasoning, in response to harmful prompts, while leaving the rest of the reasoning process unsupervised. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks indicate that SAFEPATH effectively reduces harmful outputs while maintaining reasoning performance. Specifically, SAFEPATH reduces harmful responses by up to 90.0% and blocks 83.3% of jailbreak attempts in the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B model, while requiring 295.9x less compute than Direct Refusal and 314.1x less than SafeChain. We further introduce a zero-shot variant that requires no fine-tuning. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of how existing methods in LLMs generalize, or fail, when applied to reasoning-centric models, revealing critical gaps and new directions for safer AI.

Abstract: Recent studies show that LLMs possess different skills and specialize in different tasks. In fact, we observe that their varied performance occur in several levels of granularity. For example, in the code optimization task, code LLMs excel at different optimization categories and no one dominates others. This observation prompts the question of how one leverages multiple LLM agents to solve a coding problem without knowing their complementary strengths a priori. We argue that a team of agents can learn from each other's successes and failures so as to improve their own performance. Thus, a lesson is the knowledge produced by an agent and passed on to other agents in the collective solution process. We propose a lesson-based collaboration framework, design the lesson solicitation--banking--selection mechanism, and demonstrate that a team of small LLMs with lessons learned can outperform a much larger LLM and other multi-LLM collaboration methods.

<title>Does Thinking More always Help? Mirage of Test-Time Scaling in Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1) have led to a popular belief that extending thinking traces using prompts like "Wait" or "Let me rethink" can improve performance. This raises a natural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better reasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study across models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial performance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to "overthinking". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple probabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output variance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately undermining precision. Thus, observed gains from "more thinking" are not true indicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection between model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time scaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the inference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an alternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by Best-of-N sampling. Our method generates multiple independent reasoning paths within the same inference budget and selects the most consistent response via majority vote, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy compared to extended thinking. This provides a simple yet effective mechanism for test-time scaling of reasoning models.

Abstract: We present Prover Agent, a novel AI agent for automated theorem proving that integrates large language models (LLMs) with a formal proof assistant, Lean. Prover Agent coordinates an informal reasoning LLM, a formal prover model, and feedback from Lean while also generating auxiliary lemmas. These auxiliary lemmas are not limited to subgoals in the formal proof but can also include special cases or potentially useful facts derived from the assumptions, which help in discovering a viable proof strategy. It achieves an 88.1% success rate on the MiniF2F benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art among methods using small language models (SLMs) with a much lower sample budget than previous approaches. We also present theoretical analyses and case studies that illustrate how these generated lemmas contribute to solving challenging problems. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/kAIto47802/Prover-Agent.

Abstract: Wargames are simulations of conflicts in which participants' decisions influence future events. While casual wargaming can be used for entertainment or socialization, serious wargaming is used by experts to explore strategic implications of decision-making and experiential learning. In this paper, we take the position that Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, such as Language Models (LMs), are rapidly approaching human-expert capability for strategic planning -- and will one day surpass it. Military organizations have begun using LMs to provide insights into the consequences of real-world decisions during _open-ended wargames_ which use natural language to convey actions and outcomes. We argue the ability for AI systems to influence large-scale decisions motivates additional research into the safety, interpretability, and explainability of AI in open-ended wargames. To demonstrate, we conduct a scoping literature review with a curated selection of 100 unclassified studies on AI in wargames, and construct a novel ontology of open-endedness using the creativity afforded to players, adjudicators, and the novelty provided to observers. Drawing from this body of work, we distill a set of practical recommendations and critical safety considerations for deploying AI in open-ended wargames across common domains. We conclude by presenting the community with a set of high-impact open research challenges for future work.

Abstract: Climate risk assessment requires modelling complex interactions between spatially heterogeneous hazards and adaptive economic systems. We present a novel geospatial agent-based model that integrates climate hazard data with evolutionary learning for economic agents. Our framework combines Mesa-based spatial modelling with CLIMADA climate impact assessment, introducing adaptive learning behaviours that allow firms to evolve strategies for budget allocation, pricing, wages, and risk adaptation through fitness-based selection and mutation. We demonstrate the framework using riverine flood projections under RCP8.5 until 2100, showing that evolutionary adaptation enables firms to converge with baseline (no hazard) production levels after decades of disruption due to climate stress. Our results reveal systemic risks where even agents that are not directly exposed to floods face impacts through supply chain disruptions, with the end-of-century average price of goods 5.6% higher under RCP8.5 compared to the baseline in our illustrative economic network. This open-source framework provides financial institutions and companies with tools to quantify both direct and cascading climate risks while evaluating cost-effective adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning, yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice: models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GTAlign .

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress, with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address these limitations, we propose EA4LLM, an evolutionary algorithm for optimizing LLMs, and, for the first time, empirically verify full-parameter optimization from the pretraining stage across model sizes ranging from 0.5B to 32B. We conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep learning research.

Abstract: Searching through chemical space is an exceptionally challenging problem because the number of possible molecules grows combinatorially with the number of atoms. Large, autoregressive models trained on databases of chemical compounds have yielded powerful generators, but we still lack robust strategies for generating molecules with desired properties. This molecular search problem closely resembles the "alignment" problem for large language models, though for many chemical tasks we have a specific and easily evaluable reward function. Here, we introduce an algorithm called energy rank alignment (ERA) that leverages an explicit reward function to produce a gradient-based objective that we use to optimize autoregressive policies. We show theoretically that this algorithm is closely related to proximal policy optimization (PPO) and direct preference optimization (DPO), but has a minimizer that converges to an ideal Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution with the reward playing the role of an energy function. Furthermore, this algorithm is highly scalable, does not require reinforcement learning, and performs well relative to DPO when the number of preference observations per pairing is small. We deploy this approach to align molecular transformers and protein language models to generate molecules and protein sequences, respectively, with externally specified properties and find that it does so robustly, searching through diverse parts of chemical space.

<title>Annotation Guidelines-Based Knowledge Augmentation: Towards Enhancing Large Language Models for Educational Text Classification</title>

Abstract: Various machine learning approaches have gained significant popularity for the automated classification of educational text to identify indicators of learning engagement -- i.e. learning engagement classification (LEC). LEC can offer comprehensive insights into human learning processes, attracting significant interest from diverse research communities, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Learning Analytics, and Educational Data Mining. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated remarkable performance in various NLP tasks. However, their comprehensive evaluation and improvement approaches in LEC tasks have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we propose the Annotation Guidelines-based Knowledge Augmentation (AGKA) approach to improve LLMs. AGKA employs GPT 4.0 to retrieve label definition knowledge from annotation guidelines, and then applies the random under-sampler to select a few typical examples. Subsequently, we conduct a systematic evaluation benchmark of LEC, which includes six LEC datasets covering behavior classification (question and urgency level), emotion classification (binary and epistemic emotion), and cognition classification (opinion and cognitive presence). The study results demonstrate that AGKA can enhance non-fine-tuned LLMs, particularly GPT 4.0 and Llama 3 70B. GPT 4.0 with AGKA few-shot outperforms full-shot fine-tuned models such as BERT and RoBERTa on simple binary classification datasets. However, GPT 4.0 lags in multi-class tasks that require a deep understanding of complex semantic information. Notably, Llama 3 70B with AGKA is a promising combination based on open-source LLM, because its performance is on par with closed-source GPT 4.0 with AGKA. In addition, LLMs struggle to distinguish between labels with similar names in multi-class classification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in various capabilities but pose safety risks such as generating harmful content and misinformation, even after safety alignment. In this paper, we explore the inner mechanisms of safety alignment through the lens of mechanistic interpretability, focusing on identifying and analyzing safety neurons within LLMs that are responsible for safety behaviors. We propose inference-time activation contrasting to locate these neurons and dynamic activation patching to evaluate their causal effects on model safety. Experiments on multiple prevalent LLMs demonstrate that we can consistently identify about $5\%$ safety neurons, and by only patching their activations we can restore over $90\%$ of the safety performance across various red-teaming benchmarks without influencing general ability. The finding of safety neurons also helps explain the ''alignment tax'' phenomenon by revealing that the key neurons for model safety and helpfulness significantly overlap, yet they require different activation patterns for the same neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate an application of our findings in safeguarding LLMs by detecting unsafe outputs before generation. The source code is available at https://github.com/THU-KEG/SafetyNeuron.

Abstract: Despite their immense success, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be difficult to optimize and costly to train due to hundreds of layers within the network depth. Conventional convolutional operations are fundamentally limited by their linear nature along with fixed activations, where many layers are needed to learn meaningful patterns in data. Because of the sheer size of these networks, this approach is simply computationally inefficient, and poses overfitting or gradient explosion risks, especially in small datasets. As a result, we introduce a "plug-in" module, called Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (RKAN). Our module is highly compact, so it can be easily added into any stage (level) of traditional deep networks, where it learns to integrate supportive polynomial feature transformations to existing convolutional frameworks. RKAN offers consistent improvements over baseline models in different vision tasks and widely tested benchmarks, accomplishing cutting-edge performance on them.

arXiv:2410.07812v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning models in real-world applications must continuously learn new tasks to adapt to shifts in the data-generating distribution. Yet, for Continual Learning (CL), models often struggle to balance learning new tasks (plasticity) with retaining previous knowledge (memory stability). Consequently, they are susceptible to Catastrophic Forgetting, which degrades performance and undermines the reliability of deployed systems. In the Bayesian CL literature, variational methods tackle this challenge by employing a learning objective that recursively updates the posterior distribution while constraining it to stay close to its previous estimate. Nonetheless, we argue that these methods may be ineffective due to compounding approximation errors over successive recursions. To mitigate this, we propose new learning objectives that integrate the regularization effects of multiple previous posterior estimations, preventing individual errors from dominating future posterior updates and compounding over time. We reveal insightful connections between these objectives and Temporal-Difference methods, a popular learning mechanism in Reinforcement Learning and Neuroscience. Experiments on challenging CL benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates Catastrophic Forgetting, outperforming strong Variational CL methods.

<title>Not All Heads Matter: A Head-Level KV Cache Compression Method with Integrated Retrieval and Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Key-Value (KV) caching is a common technique to enhance the computational efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs), but its memory overhead grows rapidly with input length. Prior work has shown that not all tokens are equally important for text generation, proposing layer-level KV cache compression to selectively retain key information. Recognizing the distinct roles of attention heads in generation, we propose HeadKV, a head-level KV cache compression method, and HeadKV-R2, which leverages a novel contextual reasoning ability estimation for compression. Our approach operates at the level of individual heads, estimating their importance for contextual QA tasks that require both retrieval and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks (LongBench, LooGLE), model architectures (e.g., Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct), and long-context abilities tests demonstrate that our head-level KV cache compression significantly outperforms strong baselines, particularly in low-resource settings (KV size = 64 & 128). Notably, our method retains just 1.5% of the KV cache while achieving 97% of the performance of the full KV cache on the contextual question answering benchmark.

Abstract: The typical Selective State-Space Model (SSM) used in Mamba addresses several limitations of Transformers, such as the quadratic computational complexity with respect to sequence length and the significant memory requirements during inference due to the key-value (KV) cache. However, the increasing size of Mamba models continues to pose challenges for training and deployment, particularly due to their substantial computational demands during both training and inference. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$, a scalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed to enable more efficient large language models (LLMs), with model sizes of 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B parameters. $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$ models are trained from scratch on a standard LLM-scale dataset using an autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$ achieves performance comparable to its full-precision (FP16 or BF16) counterparts, while outperforming post-training binarization (PTB) Mamba and binarization-aware training (BAT) Transformer baselines. Moreover, $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$ drastically reduces memory usage and computational cost compared to the original Mamba. Our work pioneers a new line of linear-complexity LLMs under low-bit representation and provides the way for the design of specialized hardware optimized for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based models. Code and the pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/Tangshengku/Bi-Mamba.

<title>Making Classic GNNs Strong Baselines Across Varying Homophily: A Smoothness-Generalization Perspective</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success but are often considered to be challenged by varying levels of homophily in graphs. Recent empirical studies have surprisingly shown that homophilic GNNs can perform well across datasets of different homophily levels with proper hyperparameter tuning, but the underlying theory and effective architectures remain unclear. To advance GNN universality across varying homophily, we theoretically revisit GNN message passing and uncover a novel smoothness-generalization dilemma, where increasing hops inevitably enhances smoothness at the cost of generalization. This dilemma hinders learning in higher-order homophilic neighborhoods and all heterophilic ones, where generalization is critical due to complex neighborhood class distributions that are sensitive to shifts induced by noise and sparsity. To address this, we introduce the Inceptive Graph Neural Network (IGNN) built on three simple yet effective design principles, which alleviate the dilemma by enabling distinct hop-wise generalization alongside improved overall generalization with adaptive smoothness. Benchmarking against 30 baselines demonstrates IGNN's superiority and reveals notable universality in certain homophilic GNN variants. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/galogm/IGNN.

Abstract: Faces and humans are crucial elements in social interaction and are widely included in everyday photos and videos. Therefore, a deep understanding of faces and humans will enable multi-modal assistants to achieve improved response quality and broadened application scope. Currently, the multi-modal assistant community lacks a comprehensive and scientific evaluation of face and human understanding abilities. In this paper, we first propose a hierarchical ability taxonomy that includes three levels of abilities. Then, based on this taxonomy, we collect images and annotations from publicly available datasets in the face and human community and build a semi-automatic data pipeline to produce problems for the new benchmark. Finally, the obtained Face-Human-Bench includes a development set and a test set, each with 1800 problems, supporting both English and Chinese. We conduct evaluations over 25 mainstream multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) with our Face-Human-Bench, focusing on the correlation between abilities, the impact of the relative position of targets on performance, and the impact of Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting on performance. We also explore which abilities of MLLMs need to be supplemented by specialist models. The dataset and evaluation code have been made publicly available at https://face-human-bench.github.io.

Abstract: Imagination in world models is crucial for enabling agents to learn long-horizon policy in a sample-efficient manner. Existing recurrent state-space model (RSSM)-based world models depend on single-step statistical inference to capture the environment dynamics, and, hence, they are unable to perform long-term imagination tasks due to the accumulation of prediction errors. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we propose a novel dual-mind world model (DMWM) framework that integrates logical reasoning to enable imagination with logical consistency. DMWM is composed of two components: an RSSM-based System 1 (RSSM-S1) component that handles state transitions in an intuitive manner and a logic-integrated neural network-based System 2 (LINN-S2) component that guides the imagination process through hierarchical deep logical reasoning. The inter-system feedback mechanism is designed to ensure that the imagination process follows the logical rules of the real environment. The proposed framework is evaluated on benchmark tasks that require long-term planning from the DMControl suite. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework yields significant improvements in terms of logical coherence, trial efficiency, data efficiency and long-term imagination over the state-of-the-art world models.

Abstract: Recent advances in skill learning has propelled robot manipulation to new heights by enabling it to learn complex manipulation tasks from a practical number of demonstrations. However, these skills are often limited to the particular action, object, and environment \textit{instances} that are shown in the training data, and have trouble transferring to other instances of the same category. In this work we present an open-vocabulary Spatial-Semantic Diffusion policy (S$^2$-Diffusion) which enables generalization from instance-level training data to category-level, enabling skills to be transferable between instances of the same category. We show that functional aspects of skills can be captured via a promptable semantic module combined with a spatial representation. We further propose leveraging depth estimation networks to allow the use of only a single RGB camera. Our approach is evaluated and compared on a diverse number of robot manipulation tasks, both in simulation and in the real world. Our results show that S$^2$-Diffusion is invariant to changes in category-irrelevant factors as well as enables satisfying performance on other instances within the same category, even if it was not trained on that specific instance.

Abstract: Metaphors play a critical role in shaping user experiences with Voice User Interfaces (VUIs), yet existing designs often rely on static, human-centric metaphors that fail to adapt to diverse contexts and user needs. This paper introduces Metaphor-Fluid Design, a novel approach that dynamically adjusts metaphorical representations based on conversational use-contexts. We compare this approach to a Default VUI, which characterizes the present implementation of commercial VUIs commonly designed around the persona of an assistant, offering a uniform interaction style across contexts. In Study 1 (N=130), metaphors were mapped to four key use-contexts-commands, information seeking, sociality, and error recovery-along the dimensions of formality and hierarchy, revealing distinct preferences for task-specific metaphorical designs. Study 2 (N=91) evaluates a Metaphor-Fluid VUI against a Default VUI, showing that the Metaphor-Fluid VUI enhances perceived intention to adopt, enjoyment, and likability by aligning better with user expectations for different contexts. However, individual differences in metaphor preferences highlight the need for personalization. These findings challenge the one-size-fits-all paradigm of VUI design and demonstrate the potential of Metaphor-Fluid Design to create more adaptive and engaging human-AI interactions.

Abstract: We present Neural Attention Search (NAtS), a framework that automatically evaluates the importance of each token within a sequence and determines if the corresponding token can be dropped after several steps. This approach can efficiently reduce the KV cache sizes required by transformer-based models during inference and thus reduce inference costs. In this paper, we design a search space that contains three token types: (i) Global Tokens will be preserved and queried by all the following tokens. (ii) Local Tokens survive until the next global token appears. (iii) Sliding Window Tokens have an impact on the inference of a fixed size of the next following tokens. Similar to the One-Shot Neural Architecture Search approach, this token-type information can be learned jointly with the architecture weights via a learnable attention mask. Experiments on both training a new transformer from scratch and fine-tuning existing large language models show that NAtS can efficiently reduce the KV cache size required for the models while maintaining the models' performance.

Abstract: Activation steering methods in large language models (LLMs) have emerged as an effective way to perform targeted updates to enhance generated language without requiring large amounts of adaptation data. We ask whether the features discovered by activation steering methods are interpretable. We identify neurons responsible for specific concepts (e.g., ``cat'') using the ``finding experts'' method from research on activation steering and show that the ExpertLens, i.e., inspection of these neurons provides insights about model representation. We find that ExpertLens representations are stable across models and datasets and closely align with human representations inferred from behavioral data, matching inter-human alignment levels. ExpertLens significantly outperforms the alignment captured by word/sentence embeddings. By reconstructing human concept organization through ExpertLens, we show that it enables a granular view of LLM concept representation. Our findings suggest that ExpertLens is a flexible and lightweight approach for capturing and analyzing model representations.

Abstract: Neurological disorders pose major global health challenges, driving advances in brain signal analysis. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG (iEEG) are widely used for diagnosis and monitoring. However, dataset heterogeneity and task variations hinder the development of robust deep learning solutions. This review systematically examines recent advances in deep learning approaches for EEG/iEEG-based neurological diagnostics, focusing on applications across 7 neurological conditions using 46 datasets. For each condition, we review representative methods and their quantitative results, integrating performance comparisons with analyses of data usage, model design, and task-specific adaptations, while highlighting the role of pre-trained multi-task models in achieving scalable, generalizable solutions. Finally, we propose a standardized benchmark to evaluate models across diverse datasets and improve reproducibility, emphasizing how recent innovations are transforming neurological diagnostics toward intelligent, adaptable healthcare systems.

<title>DIPLI: Deep Image Prior Lucky Imaging for Blind Astronomical Image Restoration</title>

Abstract: Modern image restoration and super-resolution methods utilize deep learning due to its superior performance compared to traditional algorithms. However, deep learning typically requires large training datasets, which are rarely available in astrophotography. Deep Image Prior (DIP) bypasses this constraint by performing blind training on a single image. Although effective in some cases, DIP often suffers from overfitting, artifact generation, and instability. To overcome these issues and improve general performance, this work proposes DIPLI - a framework that shifts from single-frame to multi-frame training using the Back Projection technique, combined with optical flow estimation via the TVNet model, and replaces deterministic predictions with unbiased Monte Carlo estimation obtained through Langevin dynamics. A comprehensive evaluation compares the method against Lucky Imaging, a classical computer vision technique still widely used in astronomical image reconstruction, DIP, the transformer-based model RVRT, and the diffusion-based model DiffIR2VR-Zero. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate consistent improvements, with the method outperforming baselines for SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and DISTS metrics in the majority of cases. In addition to superior reconstruction quality, the model also requires far fewer input images than Lucky Imaging and is less prone to overfitting or artifact generation. Evaluation on real-world astronomical data, where domain shifts typically hinder generalization, shows that the method maintains high reconstruction quality, confirming practical robustness.

Abstract: A full understanding of the behavior of a large language model (LLM) requires our grasp of its input token space. If this space differs from our assumptions, our comprehension of and conclusions about the LLM will likely be flawed. We elucidate the structure of the token embeddings both empirically and theoretically. We present a novel statistical test assuming that the neighborhood around each token has a relatively flat and smooth structure as the null hypothesis. Failing to reject the null is uninformative, but rejecting it at a specific token $\psi$ implies an irregularity in the token subspace in a $\psi$-neighborhood, $B(\psi)$. The structure assumed in the null is a generalization of a manifold with boundary called a \emph{smooth fiber bundle} (which can be split into two spatial regimes -- small and large radius), so we denote our new hypothesis test as the ``fiber bundle hypothesis.'' By running our test over several open-source LLMs, each with unique token embeddings, we find that the null is frequently rejected, and so the evidence suggests that the token subspace is not a fiber bundle and hence also not a manifold. As a consequence of our findings, when an LLM is presented with two semantically equivalent prompts, if one prompt contains a token implicated by our test, the response to that prompt will likely exhibit less stability than the other.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges in representation learning by requiring models to capture both the semantic richness of node-associated texts and the structural dependencies of the graph. While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions, text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.

Abstract: When applying reinforcement learning--typically through GRPO--to large vision-language model reasoning struggles to effectively scale reasoning length or generates verbose outputs across all tasks with only marginal gains in accuracy. To address this issue, we present FAST-GRPO, a variant of GRPO that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on question characteristics. Through empirical analysis, we establish the feasibility of fast-slow thinking in LVLMs by investigating how response length and data distribution affect performance. Inspired by these observations, we introduce two complementary metrics to estimate the difficulty of the questions, guiding the model to determine when fast or slow thinking is more appropriate. Next, we incorporate adaptive length-based rewards and difficulty-aware KL divergence into the GRPO algorithm. Experiments across seven reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FAST achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with over 10\% relative improvement compared to the base model, while reducing token usage by 32.7-67.3\% compared to previous slow-thinking approaches, effectively balancing reasoning length and accuracy.

<title>Don't be lazy: CompleteP enables compute-efficient deep transformers</title>

Abstract: We study compute efficiency of LLM training when using different parameterizations, i.e., rules for adjusting model and optimizer hyperparameters (HPs) as model size changes. Some parameterizations fail to transfer optimal base HPs (such as learning rate) across changes in model depth, requiring practitioners to either re-tune these HPs as they scale up (expensive), or accept sub-optimal training when re-tuning is prohibitive. Even when they achieve HP transfer, we develop theory to show parameterizations may still exist in the lazy learning regime where layers learn only features close to their linearization, preventing effective use of depth and nonlinearity. Finally, we identify and adopt the parameterization we call CompleteP that achieves both depth-wise HP transfer and non-lazy learning in all layers. CompleteP enables a wider range of model width/depth ratios to remain compute-efficient, unlocking shapes better suited for different hardware settings and operational contexts. Moreover, CompleteP enables 12-34% compute efficiency improvements over the prior state-of-the-art. All experiments were run on Cerebras CS-3 systems. A minimal implementation is available at https://github.com/EleutherAI/nanoGPT-mup/tree/completep.

<title>PRUNE: A Patching Based Repair Framework for Certifiable Unlearning of Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: It is often desirable to remove (a.k.a. unlearn) a specific part of the training data from a trained neural network model. A typical application scenario is to protect the data holder's right to be forgotten, which has been promoted by many recent regulation rules. Existing unlearning methods involve training alternative models with remaining data, which may be costly and challenging to verify from the data holder or a thirdparty auditor's perspective. In this work, we provide a new angle and propose a novel unlearning approach by imposing carefully crafted "patch" on the original neural network to achieve targeted "forgetting" of the requested data to delete. Specifically, inspired by the research line of neural network repair, we propose to strategically seek a lightweight minimum "patch" for unlearning a given data point with certifiable guarantee. Furthermore, to unlearn a considerable amount of data points (or an entire class), we propose to iteratively select a small subset of representative data points to unlearn, which achieves the effect of unlearning the whole set. Extensive experiments on multiple categorical datasets demonstrates our approach's effectiveness, achieving measurable unlearning while preserving the model's performance and being competitive in efficiency and memory consumption compared to various baseline methods.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising approach for scaling Transformer models. While initial works primarily incorporated MoE into feed-forward network (FFN) layers, recent studies have explored extending the MoE paradigm to attention layers to enhance model performance. However, existing attention-based MoE layers require specialized implementations and demonstrate suboptimal performance compared to their FFN-based counterparts. In this paper, we aim to unify MoE designs in attention and FFN layers by introducing a novel reformulation of the attention mechanism, that reveals an underlying FFN-like structure within attention modules. Our proposed architecture, UMoE, achieves superior performance through attention-based MoE layers while enabling efficient parameter sharing between FFN and attention components.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness in clustering aims to balance the proportions of instances assigned to each cluster with respect to a given sensitive attribute. While recently developed fair clustering algorithms optimize clustering objectives under specific fairness constraints, their inherent complexity or approximation often results in suboptimal clustering utility or numerical instability in practice. To resolve these limitations, we propose a new fair clustering algorithm based on a novel decomposition of the fair $K$-means clustering objective function. The proposed algorithm, called Fair Clustering via Alignment (FCA), operates by alternately (i) finding a joint probability distribution to align the data from different protected groups, and (ii) optimizing cluster centers in the aligned space. A key advantage of FCA is that it theoretically guarantees approximately optimal clustering utility for any given fairness level without complex constraints, thereby enabling high-utility fair clustering in practice. Experiments show that FCA outperforms existing methods by (i) attaining a superior trade-off between fairness level and clustering utility, and (ii) achieving near-perfect fairness without numerical instability.

arXiv:2505.10465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this neural scaling law, that loss decreases as a power law with model size, remains unclear. We propose that representation superposition, meaning that LLMs represent more features than they have dimensions, can be a key contributor to loss and cause neural scaling. Based on Anthropic's toy model, we use weight decay to control the degree of superposition, allowing us to systematically study how loss scales with model size. When superposition is weak, the loss follows a power law only if data feature frequencies are power-law distributed. In contrast, under strong superposition, the loss generically scales inversely with model dimension across a broad class of frequency distributions, due to geometric overlaps between representation vectors. We confirmed that open-sourced LLMs operate in the strong superposition regime and have loss scaling like one over the model dimension, and that the Chinchilla scaling laws are also consistent with this behavior. Our results identify representation superposition as a central driver of neural scaling laws, providing insights into questions like when neural scaling laws can be improved and when they will break down.

Abstract: We propose Shallow Flow Matching (SFM), a novel mechanism that enhances flow matching (FM)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models within a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Unlike conventional FM modules, which use the coarse representations from the weak generator as conditions, SFM constructs intermediate states along the FM paths from these representations. During training, we introduce an orthogonal projection method to adaptively determine the temporal position of these states, and apply a principled construction strategy based on a single-segment piecewise flow. The SFM inference starts from the intermediate state rather than pure noise, thereby focusing computation on the latter stages of the FM paths. We integrate SFM into multiple TTS models with a lightweight SFM head. Experiments demonstrate that SFM yields consistent gains in speech naturalness across both objective and subjective evaluations, and significantly accelerates inference when using adaptive-step ODE solvers. Demo and codes are available at https://ydqmkkx.github.io/SFMDemo/.

Abstract: Solving time-dependent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using a densely discretized spatial domain is a fundamental problem in various scientific and engineering disciplines, including modeling climate phenomena and fluid dynamics. However, performing these computations directly in the physical space often incurs significant computational costs. To address this issue, several neural surrogate models have been developed that operate in a compressed latent space to solve the PDE. While these approaches reduce computational complexity, they often use Transformer-based attention mechanisms to handle irregularly sampled domains, resulting in increased memory consumption. In contrast, convolutional neural networks allow memory-efficient encoding and decoding but are limited to regular discretizations. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CALM-PDE, a model class that efficiently solves arbitrarily discretized PDEs in a compressed latent space. We introduce a novel continuous convolution-based encoder-decoder architecture that uses an epsilon-neighborhood-constrained kernel and learns to apply the convolution operator to adaptive and optimized query points. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CALM-PDE on a diverse set of PDEs with both regularly and irregularly sampled spatial domains. CALM-PDE is competitive with or outperforms existing baseline methods while offering significant improvements in memory and inference time efficiency compared to Transformer-based methods.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional performance, yet their iterative sampling procedures remain computationally expensive. A prominent strategy to mitigate this cost is distillation, with offline distillation offering particular advantages in terms of efficiency, modularity, and flexibility. In this work, we identify two key observations that motivate a principled distillation framework: (1) while diffusion models have been viewed through the lens of dynamical systems theory, powerful and underexplored tools can be further leveraged; and (2) diffusion models inherently impose structured, semantically coherent trajectories in latent space. Building on these observations, we introduce the Koopman Distillation Model (KDM), a novel offline distillation approach grounded in Koopman theory - a classical framework for representing nonlinear dynamics linearly in a transformed space. KDM encodes noisy inputs into an embedded space where a learned linear operator propagates them forward, followed by a decoder that reconstructs clean samples. This enables single-step generation while preserving semantic fidelity. We provide theoretical justification for our approach: (1) under mild assumptions, the learned diffusion dynamics admit a finite-dimensional Koopman representation; and (2) proximity in the Koopman latent space correlates with semantic similarity in the generated outputs, allowing for effective trajectory alignment. KDM achieves highly competitive performance across standard offline distillation benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$, a high-quality, curated benchmark of 161 problems for end-to-end verified code generation in Lean. Each problem consists of (1) the task of generating a specification that matches a held-out ground-truth specification, and (2) the task of generating a Lean implementation that provably satisfies this specification. Unlike prior benchmarks, ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ avoids test-case supervision, LLM-generated annotations, and specifications that leak implementation logic or allow vacuous solutions. All outputs are verified post-hoc using Lean's type checker to ensure machine-checkable correctness. We use ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ to evaluate several few-shot and agentic approaches based on state-of-the-art language models. These methods all struggle to achieve full verification, establishing it as a challenging frontier benchmark for program synthesis and formal reasoning. Our benchmark can be found on GitHub(https://github.com/trishullab/clever) as well as HuggingFace(https://huggingface.co/datasets/amitayusht/clever). All our evaluation code is also available online(https://github.com/trishullab/clever-prover).

Abstract: In standard autoregressive generation, an LLM predicts the next-token distribution, samples a discrete token, and then discards the distribution, passing only the sampled token as new input. To preserve this distribution's rich information, we propose Mixture of Inputs (MoI), a training-free method for autoregressive generation. After generating a token following the standard paradigm, we construct a new input that blends the generated discrete token with the previously discarded token distribution. Specifically, we employ a Bayesian estimation method that treats the token distribution as the prior, the sampled token as the observation, and replaces the conventional one-hot vector with the continuous posterior expectation as the new model input. MoI allows the model to maintain a richer internal representation throughout the generation process, resulting in improved text quality and reasoning capabilities. On mathematical reasoning, code generation, and PhD-level QA tasks, MoI consistently improves performance across multiple models including QwQ-32B, Nemotron-Super-49B, Gemma-3-27B, and DAPO-Qwen-32B, with no additional training and negligible computational overhead.

<title>RL Tango: Reinforcing Generator and Verifier Together for Language Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a compelling approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), where an LLM generator serves as a policy guided by a verifier (reward model). However, current RL post-training methods for LLMs typically use verifiers that are fixed (rule-based or frozen pretrained) or trained discriminatively via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking and generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently train both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central innovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is trained via RL and co-evolves with the generator. Importantly, the verifier is trained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards without requiring explicit process-level annotations. This generative RL-trained verifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to deterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual reinforcement with the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both components of Tango achieve state-of-the-art results among 7B/8B-scale models: the generator attains best-in-class performance across five competition-level math benchmarks and four challenging out-of-domain reasoning tasks, while the verifier leads on the ProcessBench dataset. Remarkably, both components exhibit particularly substantial improvements on the most difficult mathematical reasoning problems. Code is at: https://github.com/kaiwenzha/rl-tango.

<title>LLM-Explorer: A Plug-in Reinforcement Learning Policy Exploration Enhancement Driven by Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Policy exploration is critical in reinforcement learning (RL), where existing approaches include greedy, Gaussian process, etc. However, these approaches utilize preset stochastic processes and are indiscriminately applied in all kinds of RL tasks without considering task-specific features that influence policy exploration. Moreover, during RL training, the evolution of such stochastic processes is rigid, which typically only incorporates a decay in the variance, failing to adjust flexibly according to the agent's real-time learning status. Inspired by the analyzing and reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), we design LLM-Explorer to adaptively generate task-specific exploration strategies with LLMs, enhancing the policy exploration in RL. In our design, we sample the learning trajectory of the agent during the RL training in a given task and prompt the LLM to analyze the agent's current policy learning status and then generate a probability distribution for future policy exploration. Updating the probability distribution periodically, we derive a stochastic process specialized for the particular task and dynamically adjusted to adapt to the learning process. Our design is a plug-in module compatible with various widely applied RL algorithms, including the DQN series, DDPG, TD3, and any possible variants developed based on them. Through extensive experiments on the Atari and MuJoCo benchmarks, we demonstrate LLM-Explorer's capability to enhance RL policy exploration, achieving an average performance improvement up to 37.27%. Our code is open-source at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/LLM-Explorer for reproducibility.

<title>How Ensembles of Distilled Policies Improve Generalisation in Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: In the zero-shot policy transfer setting in reinforcement learning, the goal is to train an agent on a fixed set of training environments so that it can generalise to similar, but unseen, testing environments. Previous work has shown that policy distillation after training can sometimes produce a policy that outperforms the original in the testing environments. However, it is not yet entirely clear why that is, or what data should be used to distil the policy. In this paper, we prove, under certain assumptions, a generalisation bound for policy distillation after training. The theory provides two practical insights: for improved generalisation, you should 1) train an ensemble of distilled policies, and 2) distil it on as much data from the training environments as possible. We empirically verify that these insights hold in more general settings, when the assumptions required for the theory no longer hold. Finally, we demonstrate that an ensemble of policies distilled on a diverse dataset can generalise significantly better than the original agent.

<title>Your Pre-trained LLM is Secretly an Unsupervised Confidence Calibrator</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16690</link>

arXiv:2505.16690v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks. While PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language models (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to both correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical applications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled data for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Disagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to optimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\tau$) in post-hoc confidence calibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by prediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their confidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence underestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a larger $\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by selectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively decoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an overly large $\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples, improving calibration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, improving the average ECE of open-sourced and API-based LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o) by up to 15.08$\%$ on common benchmarks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent in global applications, ensuring that they are toxicity-free across diverse linguistic contexts remains a critical challenge. We explore "Cross-lingual Detoxification", a cross-lingual paradigm that mitigates toxicity, enabling detoxification capabilities to transfer between high and low-resource languages across different script families. We analyze cross-lingual detoxification's effectiveness through 392 extensive settings to evaluate toxicity reduction in cross-distribution settings with limited data and investigate how mitigation impacts model performance on non-toxic tasks, revealing trade-offs between safety and knowledge preservation. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/himanshubeniwal/Breaking-mBad.

Abstract: Legal consultation is essential for safeguarding individual rights and ensuring access to justice, yet remains costly and inaccessible to many individuals due to the shortage of professionals. While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward scalable, low-cost legal assistance, current systems fall short in handling the interactive and knowledge-intensive nature of real-world consultations. To address these challenges, we introduce LeCoDe, a real-world multi-turn benchmark dataset comprising 3,696 legal consultation dialogues with 110,008 dialogue turns, designed to evaluate and improve LLMs' legal consultation capability. With LeCoDe, we innovatively collect live-streamed consultations from short-video platforms, providing authentic multi-turn legal consultation dialogues. The rigorous annotation by legal experts further enhances the dataset with professional insights and expertise. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses LLMs' consultation capabilities in terms of (1) clarification capability and (2) professional advice quality. This unified framework incorporates 12 metrics across two dimensions. Through extensive experiments on various general and domain-specific LLMs, our results reveal significant challenges in this task, with even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 achieving only 39.8% recall for clarification and 59% overall score for advice quality, highlighting the complexity of professional consultation scenarios. Based on these findings, we further explore several strategies to enhance LLMs' legal consultation abilities. Our benchmark contributes to advancing research in legal domain dialogue systems, particularly in simulating more real-world user-expert interactions.

<title>Towards Interpretability Without Sacrifice: Faithful Dense Layer Decomposition with Mixture of Decoders</title>

Abstract: Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are an integral part of large language models, yet their dense representations render them difficult to understand, edit, and steer. Recent methods learn interpretable approximations via neuron-level sparsity, yet fail to faithfully reconstruct the original mapping--significantly increasing model's next-token cross-entropy loss. In this paper, we advocate for moving to layer-level sparsity to overcome the accuracy trade-off in sparse layer approximation. Under this paradigm, we introduce Mixture of Decoders (MxDs). MxDs generalize MLPs and Gated Linear Units, expanding pre-trained dense layers into tens of thousands of specialized sublayers. Through a flexible form of tensor factorization, each sparsely activating MxD sublayer implements a linear transformation with full-rank weights--preserving the original decoders' expressive capacity even under heavy sparsity. Experimentally, we show that MxDs significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods (e.g., Transcoders) on the sparsity-accuracy frontier in language models with up to 3B parameters. Further evaluations on sparse probing and feature steering demonstrate that MxDs learn similarly specialized features of natural language--opening up a promising new avenue for designing interpretable yet faithful decompositions. Our code is included at: https://github.com/james-oldfield/MxD/.

arXiv:2505.21441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a principled method for autoencoding with random forests. Our strategy builds on foundational results from nonparametric statistics and spectral graph theory to learn a low-dimensional embedding of the model that optimally represents relationships in the data. We provide exact and approximate solutions to the decoding problem via constrained optimization, split relabeling, and nearest neighbors regression. These methods effectively invert the compression pipeline, establishing a map from the embedding space back to the input space using splits learned by the ensemble's constituent trees. The resulting decoders are universally consistent under common regularity assumptions. The procedure works with supervised or unsupervised models, providing a window into conditional or joint distributions. We demonstrate various applications of this autoencoder, including powerful new tools for visualization, compression, clustering, and denoising. Experiments illustrate the ease and utility of our method in a wide range of settings, including tabular, image, and genomic data.

<title>Balanced Token Pruning: Accelerating Vision Language Models Beyond Local Optimization</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance across multi-modal tasks by encoding images into thousands of tokens. However, the large number of image tokens results in significant computational overhead, and the use of dynamic high-resolution inputs further increases this burden. Previous approaches have attempted to reduce the number of image tokens through token pruning, typically by selecting tokens based on attention scores or image token diversity. Through empirical studies, we observe that existing methods often overlook the joint impact of pruning on both the current layer's output (local) and the outputs of subsequent layers (global), leading to suboptimal pruning decisions. To address this challenge, we propose Balanced Token Pruning (BTP), a plug-and-play method for pruning vision tokens. Specifically, our method utilizes a small calibration set to divide the pruning process into multiple stages. In the early stages, our method emphasizes the impact of pruning on subsequent layers, whereas in the deeper stages, the focus shifts toward preserving the consistency of local outputs. Extensive experiments across various LVLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our approach on multiple benchmarks. Our method achieves a 78% compression rate while preserving 96.7% of the original models' performance on average. Our code is available at https://github.com/EmbodiedCity/NeurIPS2025-Balanced-Token-Pruning.

<title>Train with Perturbation, Infer after Merging: A Two-Stage Framework for Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) aims to enable models to continuously acquire new knowledge from a sequence of tasks with avoiding the forgetting of learned information. However, existing CL methods only rely on the parameters of the most recent task for inference, which makes them susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. Inspired by the recent success of model merging techniques, we propose \textbf{Perturb-and-Merge (P\&amp;M)}, a novel continual learning framework that integrates model merging into the CL paradigm to mitigate forgetting. Specifically, after training on each task, P\&amp;M constructs a new model by forming a convex combination of the previous model and the newly trained task-specific model. Through theoretical analysis, We minimize the total loss increase across all tasks and derive a closed-form solution for the merging coefficient under mild assumptions. To further improve the performance of the merged model, we observe that the degradation introduced during merging can be alleviated by a regularization term composed of the task vector and the Hessian matrix of the loss function. Interestingly, we show that this term can be efficiently approximated using second-order symmetric finite differences, and a stochastic perturbation strategy along the task vector direction is accordingly devised which incurs no additional forward or backward passes while providing an effective approximation of the regularization term. Finally, we combine P\&amp;M with LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to reduce memory overhead. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several continual learning benchmark datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/qhmiao/P-M-for-Continual-Learning.

arXiv:2505.22601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning algorithms aim to remove the influence of specific training samples, ideally recovering the model that would have resulted from training on the remaining data alone. We study unlearning in the overparameterized setting, where many models interpolate the data, and defining the solution as any loss minimizer over the retained set$\unicode{x2013}$as in prior work in the underparameterized setting$\unicode{x2013}$is inadequate, since the original model may already interpolate the retained data and satisfy this condition. In this regime, loss gradients vanish, rendering prior methods based on gradient perturbations ineffective, motivating both new unlearning definitions and algorithms. For this setting, we define the unlearning solution as the minimum-complexity interpolator over the retained data and propose a new algorithmic framework that only requires access to model gradients on the retained set at the original solution. We minimize a regularized objective over perturbations constrained to be orthogonal to these model gradients, a first-order relaxation of the interpolation condition. For different model classes, we provide exact and approximate unlearning guarantees and demonstrate that an implementation of our framework outperforms existing baselines across various unlearning experiments.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous robots in safety-critical applications requires safety guarantees. Provably safe reinforcement learning is an active field of research that aims to provide such guarantees using safeguards. These safeguards should be integrated during training to reduce the sim-to-real gap. While there are several approaches for safeguarding sampling-based reinforcement learning, analytic gradient-based reinforcement learning often achieves superior performance from fewer environment interactions. However, there is no safeguarding approach for this learning paradigm yet. Our work addresses this gap by developing the first effective safeguard for analytic gradient-based reinforcement learning. We analyse existing, differentiable safeguards, adapt them through modified mappings and gradient formulations, and integrate them into a state-of-the-art learning algorithm and a differentiable simulation. Using numerical experiments on three control tasks, we evaluate how different safeguards affect learning. The results demonstrate safeguarded training without compromising performance.

<title>Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Spatial Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures, making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC, KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and maintained high performance. The code is available at https://github.com/nayutayuki/FuseUNet.

Abstract: Emerging Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) consistently excel in mathematical and reasoning tasks, showcasing remarkable capabilities. However, the enhancement of reasoning abilities and the exposure of internal reasoning processes introduce new safety vulnerabilities. A critical question arises: when reasoning becomes intertwined with harmfulness, will LRMs become more vulnerable to jailbreaks in reasoning mode? To investigate this, we introduce HauntAttack, a novel and general-purpose black-box adversarial attack framework that systematically embeds harmful instructions into reasoning questions. Specifically, we modify key reasoning conditions in existing questions with harmful instructions, thereby constructing a reasoning pathway that guides the model step by step toward unsafe outputs. We evaluate HauntAttack on 11 LRMs and observe an average attack success rate of 70\%, achieving up to 12 percentage points of absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline. Our further analysis reveals that even advanced safety-aligned models remain highly susceptible to reasoning-based attacks, offering insights into the urgent challenge of balancing reasoning capability and safety in future model development.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and audio language models have significantly improved music generation, particularly in lyrics-to-song generation. However, existing approaches still struggle with the complex composition of songs and the scarcity of high-quality data, leading to limitations in audio quality, musicality, instruction following, and vocal-instrument harmony. To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, a language model based framework consisting of LeLM and Music Codec. LeLM is capable of parallel modeling of two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve better vocal-instrument harmony, and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for high-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only transformers and a modular extension training strategy to prevent interference between different token types. To further enhance musicality and instruction following ability, we introduce a multi-preference alignment method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human preferences through a semi-automatic data construction process and post-training. Experimental results demonstrate that LeVo significantly outperforms existing open-source methods in both objective and subjective metrics, while performing competitively with industry systems. Ablation studies further justify the effectiveness of our designs. Audio examples and source code are available at https://levo-demo.github.io and https://github.com/tencent-ailab/songgeneration.

Abstract: Autoregressive generative models naturally generate variable-length sequences, while non-autoregressive models struggle, often imposing rigid, token-wise structures. We propose Edit Flows, a non-autoregressive model that overcomes these limitations by defining a discrete flow over sequences through edit operations$\unicode{x2013}$insertions, deletions, and substitutions. By modeling these operations within a Continuous-time Markov Chain over the sequence space, Edit Flows enable flexible, position-relative generation that aligns more closely with the structure of sequence data. Our training method leverages an expanded state space with auxiliary variables, making the learning process efficient and tractable. Empirical results show that Edit Flows outperforms both autoregressive and mask models on image captioning and significantly outperforms the mask construction in text and code generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the automation of data science workflows. Yet it remains unclear whether they can critically leverage external domain knowledge as human data scientists do in practice. To answer this question, we introduce AssistedDS (Assisted Data Science), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate how LLMs handle domain knowledge in tabular prediction tasks. AssistedDS features both synthetic datasets with explicitly known generative mechanisms and real-world Kaggle competitions, each accompanied by curated bundles of helpful and adversarial documents. These documents provide domain-specific insights into data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection. We assess state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to discern and apply beneficial versus harmful domain knowledge, evaluating submission validity, information recall, and predictive performance. Our results demonstrate three key findings: (1) LLMs frequently exhibit an uncritical adoption of provided information, significantly impairing their predictive performance when adversarial content is introduced, (2) helpful guidance is often insufficient to counteract the negative influence of adversarial information, and (3) in Kaggle datasets, LLMs often make errors in handling time-series data, applying consistent feature engineering across different folds, and interpreting categorical variables correctly. These findings highlight a substantial gap in current models' ability to critically evaluate and leverage expert knowledge, underscoring an essential research direction for developing more robust, knowledge-aware automated data science systems.

Abstract: Watermarking the outputs of generative models has emerged as a promising approach for tracking their provenance. Despite significant interest in autoregressive image generation models and their potential for misuse, no prior work has attempted to watermark their outputs at the token level. In this work, we present the first such approach by adapting language model watermarking techniques to this setting. We identify a key challenge: the lack of reverse cycle-consistency (RCC), wherein re-tokenizing generated image tokens significantly alters the token sequence, effectively erasing the watermark. To address this and to make our method robust to common image transformations, neural compression, and removal attacks, we introduce (i) a custom tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning procedure that improves RCC, and (ii) a complementary watermark synchronization layer. As our experiments demonstrate, our approach enables reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically grounded p-values. Code and models are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/wmar.

<title>Flow based approach for Dynamic Temporal Causal models with non-Gaussian or Heteroscedastic Noises</title>

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is crucial in many scenarios, such as those dealing with financial or neurological data. Many such time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments with a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal structure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for analyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this setting is challenging due to (1) non-stationarity, i.e., each regime can have its own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions, which may be nonGaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery approaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity or Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified framework for causal discovery that handles non-stationary processes along with non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the number of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's Directed Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm that maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log-likelihood. On the theoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal heteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are identifiable in both stationary and non-stationary settings. In addition, extensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that FANTOM outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect'' reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions, encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these advantages.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a crucial find-grained cardiac feature, has been successfully recovered from radar signals in the literature, but the performance heavily relies on the high-quality radar signal and numerous radar-ECG pairs for training, restricting the applications in new scenarios due to data scarcity. Therefore, this work will focus on radar-based ECG recovery in new scenarios with limited data and propose a cardio-focusing and -tracking (CFT) algorithm to precisely track the cardiac location to ensure an efficient acquisition of high-quality radar signals. Furthermore, a transfer learning model (RFcardi) is proposed to extract cardio-related information from the radar signal without ECG ground truth based on the intrinsic sparsity of cardiac features, and only a few synchronous radar-ECG pairs are required to fine-tune the pre-trained model for the ECG recovery. The experimental results reveal that the proposed CFT can dynamically identify the cardiac location, and the RFcardi model can effectively generate faithful ECG recoveries after using a small number of radar-ECG pairs for training. The code and dataset are available after the publication.

Abstract: Modular exponentiation is crucial to number theory and cryptography, yet remains largely unexplored from a mechanistic interpretability standpoint. We train a 4-layer encoder-decoder Transformer model to perform this operation and investigate the emergence of numerical reasoning during training. Utilizing principled sampling strategies, PCA-based embedding analysis, and activation patching, we examine how number-theoretic properties are encoded within the model. We find that reciprocal operand training leads to strong performance gains, with sudden generalization across related moduli. These synchronized accuracy surges reflect grokking-like dynamics, suggesting the model internalizes shared arithmetic structure. We also find a subgraph consisting entirely of attention heads in the final layer sufficient to achieve full performance on the task of regular exponentiation. These results suggest that transformer models learn modular arithmetic through specialized computational circuits, paving the way for more interpretable and efficient neural approaches to modular exponentiation.

Abstract: This study presents a benchmarking analysis of the Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 Ultra (QAic) accelerator for large language model (LLM) inference, evaluating its energy efficiency (throughput per watt), performance, and hardware scalability against NVIDIA A100 GPUs (in 4x and 8x configurations) within the National Research Platform (NRP) ecosystem. A total of 12 open-source LLMs, ranging from 124 million to 70 billion parameters, are served using the vLLM framework. Our analysis reveals that QAic achieves competitive energy efficiency with advantages on specific models while enabling more granular hardware allocation: some 70B models operate on as few as 1 QAic card versus 8 A100 GPUs required, with 20x lower power consumption (148W vs 2,983W). For smaller models, single QAic devices achieve up to 35x lower power consumption compared to our 4-GPU A100 configuration (36W vs 1,246W). The findings offer insights into the potential of the Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 Ultra for energy-constrained and resource-efficient HPC deployments within the National Research Platform (NRP).

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) allows model builders to capture the task-specific parameters into adapters, which are a fraction of the size of the original base model. Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to the creation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing frameworks fall short in supporting inference or fine-tuning with multiple adapters in the following ways. 1) For fine-tuning, each job needs to deploy its dedicated base model instance, which results in excessive GPU memory consumption and poor GPU utilization. 2) While popular inference platforms can serve multiple PEFT adapters, they do not allow independent resource management or mixing of different PEFT methods. 3) They cannot make effective use of heterogeneous accelerators. 4) They do not provide privacy to users who may not wish to expose their fine-tuned parameters to service providers. In Symbiosis, we address the above problems by enabling the as-a-service deployment of the base model. The base model layers can be shared across multiple inference or fine-tuning processes. Our split-execution technique decouples the execution of client-specific adapters and layers from the frozen base model layers offering them flexibility to manage their resources, to select their fine-tuning method, to achieve their performance goals. Our approach is transparent to models and works out-of-the-box for most models in the transformers library. We demonstrate the use of Symbiosis to simultaneously fine-tune 20 Gemma2-27B adapters on 8 GPUs.

Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result, small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative despite inherent performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has been explored for domain adaptation, its utility in commercial settings remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the effectiveness of a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models and service domains, producing DACP-applied sLLMs (ixi-GEN). Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that ixi-GEN models achieve substantial gains in target-domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

<title>Crafting Imperceptible On-Manifold Adversarial Attacks for Tabular Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10998</link>

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on tabular data present unique challenges due to the heterogeneous nature of mixed categorical and numerical features. Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual similarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it difficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional gradient-based methods prioritise $\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing adversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions. To address this, we propose a latent-space perturbation framework using a mixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate statistically consistent adversarial examples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical features into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve statistical consistency. We introduce In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to jointly evaluate attack effectiveness and distributional alignment. Evaluation across six publicly available datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method achieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance compared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted from image domain approaches, achieving substantially lower outlier rates and higher IDSR across six datasets and three model architectures. Our comprehensive analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control, and generative architecture demonstrate that the effectiveness of VAE-based attacks depends strongly on reconstruction quality and the availability of sufficient training data. When these conditions are met, the proposed framework achieves superior practical utility and stability compared with input-space methods. This work underscores the importance of maintaining on-manifold perturbations for generating realistic and robust adversarial examples in tabular domains.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings. The code is available at https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/FDAM.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient skin lesion classification on edge devices is critical for accessible dermatological care but remains challenging due to computational, energy, and privacy constraints. We introduce QANA, a novel quantization-aware neuromorphic architecture for incremental skin lesion classification on resource-limited hardware. QANA effectively integrates ghost modules, efficient channel attention, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks for robust feature representation with low-latency and energy-efficient inference. Its quantization-aware head and spike-compatible transformations enable seamless conversion to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and deployment on neuromorphic platforms. Evaluation on the large-scale HAM10000 benchmark and a real-world clinical dataset shows that QANA achieves 91.6% Top-1 accuracy and 82.4% macro F1 on HAM10000, and 90.8%/81.7% on the clinical dataset, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN models under fair comparison. Deployed on BrainChip Akida hardware, QANA achieves 1.5 ms inference latency and 1.7,mJ energy per image, reducing inference latency and energy use by over 94.6%/98.6% compared to GPU-based CNNs surpassing state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN conversion baselines. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of QANA for accurate, real-time, and privacy-sensitive medical analysis in edge environments.

Abstract: Multi-robot coordination has traditionally relied on a mission-specific and expert-driven pipeline, where natural language mission descriptions are manually translated by domain experts into mathematical formulation, algorithm design, and executable code. This conventional process is labor-intensive, inaccessible to non-experts, and inflexible to changes in mission requirements. Here, we propose LAN2CB (Language to Collective Behavior), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to streamline and generalize the multi-robot coordination pipeline. LAN2CB transforms natural language (NL) mission descriptions into executable Python code for multi-robot systems through two core modules: (1) Mission Analysis, which parses mission descriptions into behavior trees, and (2) Code Generation, which leverages the behavior tree and a structured knowledge base to generate robot control code. We further introduce a dataset of natural language mission descriptions to support development and benchmarking. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that LAN2CB enables robust and flexible multi-robot coordination from natural language, significantly reducing manual engineering effort and supporting broad generalization across diverse mission types.

Abstract: Code review is essential for maintaining software quality but often time-consuming and cognitively demanding, especially in industrial environments. Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have opened new avenues for automating core review tasks. This study presents the empirical evaluation of monolingual fine-tuning on the performance of open-source LMs across three key automated code review tasks: Code Change Quality Estimation, Review Comment Generation, and Code Refinement. We fine-tuned three distinct models, CodeReviewer, CodeLlama-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill, on a C\# specific dataset combining public benchmarks with industrial repositories. Our study investigates how different configurations of programming languages and natural languages in the training data affect LM performance, particularly in comment generation. Additionally, we benchmark the fine-tuned models against an automated software analysis tool (ASAT) and human reviewers to evaluate their practical utility in real-world settings. Our results show that monolingual fine-tuning improves model accuracy and relevance compared to multilingual baselines. While LMs can effectively support code review workflows, especially for routine or repetitive tasks, human reviewers remain superior in handling semantically complex or context-sensitive changes. Our findings highlight the importance of language alignment and task-specific adaptation in optimizing LMs for automated code review.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human annotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech, vision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open research and progress in MLLMs development.

Abstract: Sensor-based sorting systems enable the physical separation of a material stream into two fractions. The sorting decision is based on the image data evaluation of the sensors used and is carried out using actuators. Various process parameters must be set depending on the properties of the material stream, the dimensioning of the system, and the required sorting accuracy. However, continuous verification and re-adjustment are necessary due to changing requirements and material stream compositions. In this paper, we introduce an approach for optimizing, recurrently monitoring and adjusting the process parameters of a sensor-based sorting system. Based on Bayesian Optimization, Gaussian process regression models are used as surrogate models to achieve specific requirements for system behavior with the uncertainties contained therein. This method minimizes the number of necessary experiments while simultaneously considering two possible optimization targets based on the requirements for both material output streams. In addition, uncertainties are considered during determining sorting accuracies in the model calculation. We evaluated the method with three example process parameters.

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch, inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) conferences are essential for advancing research, sharing knowledge, and fostering academic community. However, their rapid expansion has rendered the centralized conference model increasingly unsustainable. This paper offers a data-driven diagnosis of a structural crisis that threatens the foundational goals of scientific dissemination, equity, and community well-being. We identify four key areas of strain: (1) scientifically, with per-author publication rates more than doubling over the past decade to over 4.5 papers annually; (2) environmentally, with the carbon footprint of a single conference exceeding the daily emissions of its host city; (3) psychologically, with 71% of online community discourse reflecting negative sentiment and 35% referencing mental health concerns; and (4) logistically, with attendance at top conferences such as NeurIPS 2024 beginning to outpace venue capacity. These pressures point to a system that is misaligned with its core mission. In response, we propose the Community-Federated Conference (CFC) model, which separates peer review, presentation, and networking into globally coordinated but locally organized components, offering a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient path forward for AI research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in general language tasks, yet adapting them to specific domains remains a challenge. Current method like Domain Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT) requires costly full-parameter training and suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces substantial inference latency due to expensive nearest-neighbor searches and longer context. This paper introduces Memory Decoder, a plug-and-play pretrained memory that enables efficient domain adaptation without changing the original model's parameters. Memory Decoder employs a small transformer decoder that learns to imitate the behavior of an external non-parametric retriever. Once trained, Memory Decoder can be seamlessly integrated with any pretrained language model that shares the same tokenizer, requiring no model-specific modifications. Experimental results demonstrate that Memory Decoder enables effective adaptation of various Qwen and Llama models to three distinct specialized domains: biomedicine, finance, and law, reducing perplexity by an average of 6.17 points. Overall, Memory Decoder introduces a novel paradigm centered on a specially pretrained memory component designed for domain-specific adaptation. This memory architecture can be integrated in a plug-and-play manner, consistently enhancing performance across multiple models within the target domain.

<title>LFD: Layer Fused Decoding to Exploit External Knowledge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) incorporates external knowledge into large language models (LLMs), improving their adaptability to downstream tasks and enabling information updates. Surprisingly, recent empirical evidence demonstrates that injecting noise into retrieved relevant documents paradoxically facilitates exploitation of external knowledge and improves generation quality. Although counterintuitive and challenging to apply in practice, this phenomenon enables granular control and rigorous analysis of how LLMs integrate external knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we intervene on noise injection and establish a layer-specific functional demarcation within the LLM: shallow layers specialize in local context modeling, intermediate layers focus on integrating long-range external factual knowledge, and deeper layers primarily rely on parametric internal knowledge. Building on this insight, we propose Layer Fused Decoding (LFD), a simple decoding strategy that directly combines representations from an intermediate layer with final-layer decoding outputs to fully exploit the external factual knowledge. To identify the optimal intermediate layer, we introduce an internal knowledge score (IKS) criterion that selects the layer with the lowest IKS value in the latter half of layers. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LFD helps RAG systems more effectively surface retrieved context knowledge with minimal cost.

Abstract: In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.

Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to similar representations across architectures, the representational properties of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs, lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery, improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.

Abstract: Biomedical literature and clinical narratives pose multifaceted challenges for natural language understanding, from precise entity extraction and document synthesis to multi-step diagnostic reasoning. This study extends a unified benchmark to evaluate GPT-5 and GPT-4o under zero-, one-, and five-shot prompting across five core biomedical NLP tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, summarization, and simplification, and nine expanded biomedical QA datasets covering factual knowledge, clinical reasoning, and multimodal visual understanding. Using standardized prompts, fixed decoding parameters, and consistent inference pipelines, we assessed model performance, latency, and token-normalized cost under official pricing. GPT-5 consistently outperformed GPT-4o, with the largest gains on reasoning-intensive datasets such as MedXpertQA and DiagnosisArena and stable improvements in multimodal QA. In core tasks, GPT-5 achieved better chemical NER and ChemProt scores but remained below domain-tuned baselines for disease NER and summarization. Despite producing longer outputs, GPT-5 showed comparable latency and 30 to 50 percent lower effective cost per correct prediction. Fine-grained analyses revealed improvements in diagnosis, treatment, and reasoning subtypes, whereas boundary-sensitive extraction and evidence-dense summarization remain challenging. Overall, GPT-5 approaches deployment-ready performance for biomedical QA while offering a favorable balance of accuracy, interpretability, and economic efficiency. The results support a tiered prompting strategy: direct prompting for large-scale or cost-sensitive applications, and chain-of-thought scaffolds for analytically complex or high-stakes scenarios, highlighting the continued need for hybrid solutions where precision and factual fidelity are critical.

Abstract: We investigate reinforcement learning in the Game Of Hidden Rules (GOHR) environment, a complex puzzle in which an agent must infer and execute hidden rules to clear a 6$\times$6 board by placing game pieces into buckets. We explore two state representation strategies, namely Feature-Centric (FC) and Object-Centric (OC), and employ a Transformer-based Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm for training. The agent has access only to partial observations and must simultaneously infer the governing rule and learn the optimal policy through experience. We evaluate our models across multiple rule-based and trial-list-based experimental setups, analyzing transfer effects and the impact of representation on learning efficiency.

Abstract: A hallmark of modern large-scale machine learning techniques is the use of training objectives that provide dense supervision to intermediate computations, such as teacher forcing the next token in language models or denoising step-by-step in diffusion models. This enables models to learn complex functions in a generalizable manner. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the benefits of iterative computation for temporal difference (TD) methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically they represent value functions in a monolithic fashion, without iterative compute. We introduce floq (flow-matching Q-functions), an approach that parameterizes the Q-function using a velocity field and trains it using techniques from flow-matching, typically used in generative modeling. This velocity field underneath the flow is trained using a TD-learning objective, which bootstraps from values produced by a target velocity field, computed by running multiple steps of numerical integration. Crucially, floq allows for more fine-grained control and scaling of the Q-function capacity than monolithic architectures, by appropriately setting the number of integration steps. Across a suite of challenging offline RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly 1.8x. floq scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures, highlighting the potential of iterative computation for value learning.

Abstract: Legal documents are often long, dense, and difficult to comprehend, not only for laypeople but also for legal experts. While automated document summarization has great potential to improve access to legal knowledge, prevailing task-based evaluators overlook divergent user and stakeholder needs. Tool development is needed to encompass the technicality of a case summary for a litigator yet be accessible for a self-help public researching for their lawsuit. We introduce PersonaMatrix, a persona-by-criterion evaluation framework that scores summaries through the lens of six personas, including legal and non-legal users. We also introduce a controlled dimension-shifted pilot dataset of U.S. civil rights case summaries that varies along depth, accessibility, and procedural detail as well as Diversity-Coverage Index (DCI) to expose divergent optima of legal summary between persona-aware and persona-agnostic judges. This work enables refinement of legal AI summarization systems for both expert and non-expert users, with the potential to increase access to legal knowledge. The code base and data are publicly available in GitHub.

Abstract: Intent classification models have made a significant progress in recent years. However, previous studies primarily focus on high-resource language datasets, which results in a gap for low-resource languages and for regions with high rates of illiteracy, where languages are more spoken than read or written. This is the case in Senegal, for example, where Wolof is spoken by around 90\% of the population, while the national illiteracy rate remains at of 42\%. Wolof is actually spoken by more than 10 million people in West African region. To address these limitations, we introduce the Wolof Banking Speech Intent Classification Dataset (WolBanking77), for academic research in intent classification. WolBanking77 currently contains 9,791 text sentences in the banking domain and more than 4 hours of spoken sentences. Experiments on various baselines are conducted in this work, including text and voice state-of-the-art models. The results are very promising on this current dataset. In addition, this paper presents an in-depth examination of the dataset's contents. We report baseline F1-scores and word error rates metrics respectively on NLP and ASR models trained on WolBanking77 dataset and also comparisons between models.

Abstract: Domain-specific LLMs in TCM face limitations in research settings due to constrained adaptability, insufficient evaluation datasets, and limited computational resources. This study presents TianHui, a specialized TCM LLM built through contextual data integration and domain knowledge fusion. We constructed a large-scale TCM corpus (0.97GB unsupervised data + 611,312 QA pairs) and employed a two-stage training strategy with QLoRA, DeepSpeed Stage 2, and Flash Attention 2. Evaluation on 12 benchmarks showed TianHui ranked top-three in all metrics for six datasets (APQ, TCMCD, HFR, HCCA, DHPE, TLAW) and achieved top results in the other six (TCMEE, APR, GCPMI, TCMKQA, TCMRC, ADTG). Optimal configuration was identified as LoRA rank=128, alpha=256, epoch=4, dropout=0.2, max length=2048. TianHui enables systematic preservation and scalable application of TCM knowledge. All resources are open-sourced.

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2) decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies (LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising 22 generative models. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/xigua7105/FerretNet.

<title>DragFlow: Unleashing DiT Priors with Region Based Supervision for Drag Editing</title>

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion, are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly: unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm, where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities. For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench) featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Hallucinations are a common issue that undermine the reliability of large language models (LLMs). Recent studies have identified a specific subset of hallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive uncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating predictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been developed. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty estimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA) datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate correctness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and, consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows one to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We propose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation experiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms for NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge variants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore structured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection tasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we propose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an objective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.

Abstract: Wordle presents an algorithmically rich testbed for constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solving. While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy, computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315 English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9% success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3 percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates 88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration, robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for structured puzzle-solving domains.

Abstract: Interdisciplinary teaching is a cornerstone of modern curriculum reform, but its implementation is hindered by challenges in knowledge integration and time-consuming lesson planning. Existing tools often lack the required pedagogical and domain-specific depth.We introduce TriQuest, an AI-copilot platform designed to solve these problems. TriQuest uses large language models and knowledge graphs via an intuitive GUI to help teachers efficiently generate high-quality interdisciplinary lesson plans. Its core features include intelligent knowledge integration from various disciplines and a human-computer collaborative review process to ensure quality and innovation.In a study with 43 teachers, TriQuest increased curriculum design efficiency and improved lesson plan quality. It also significantly lowered design barriers and cognitive load. Our work presents a new paradigm for empowering teacher professional development with intelligent technologies.

<title>Replacing Softmax Similarity with a Sharpened Angular Similarity: Theory and Practice of Scaling To Billion-Context Attention</title>

Abstract: Softmax Attention has a quadratic time complexity, which becomes prohibitive to run at long contexts, even with highly optimized GPU kernels. For example, FlashAttention (an exact, GPU-optimized implementation of Softmax Attention) cannot complete a single forward-backward pass of a multi-head attention layer once the context exceeds ~4 million tokens on an NVIDIA GH200 (96 GB). We introduce RACE Attention, a kernel-inspired alternative to Softmax Attention that is linear in sequence length and embedding dimension. RACE Attention replaces the exponential kernel with a sharpened angular (cosine) similarity, and approximates attention outputs via randomized projections and soft Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). Across language modeling, masked language modeling, and text classification, RACE Attention matches the accuracy of strong baselines while reducing runtime and memory. In a controlled scale test, it processes up to 12 million tokens during a single forward-backward pass on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU and 75 million tokens on an Intel Xeon Gold 5220R CPU, well beyond the practical limits of the current state-of-the-art attention implementations. RACE Attention thus offers a practical, theoretically grounded mechanism for outrageously long context windows on today's hardware. We hope that it gets adopted in practice.

Abstract: Digital technologies are transforming democratic life in conflicting ways. This article bridges two perspectives to unpack these tensions. First, we present an original survey of software developers in Silicon Valley, interrogating how coder worldviews, ethics, and workplace cultures shape the democratic potential and social impact of the technologies they build. Results indicate that while most developers recognize the power of their products to influence civil liberties and political discourse, they often face ethical dilemmas and top-down pressures that can lead to design choices undermining democratic ideals. Second, we critically investigate these findings in the context of an emerging new digital divide, not of internet access but of information quality. We interrogate the survey findings in the context of the Slop Economy, in which billions of users unable to pay for high-quality content experience an internet dominated by low-quality, AI-generated ad-driven content. We find a reinforcing cycle between tech creator beliefs and the digital ecosystems they spawn. We discuss implications for democratic governance, arguing for more ethically informed design and policy interventions to help bridge the digital divide to ensure that technological innovation supports rather than subverts democratic values in the next chapter of the digital age.

Abstract: Pretrained transformers readily adapt to new sequence modeling tasks via zero-shot prompting, but relational domains still lack architectures that transfer across datasets and tasks. The core challenge is the diversity of relational data, with varying heterogeneous schemas, graph structures and functional dependencies. In this paper, we present the Relational Transformer (RT) architecture, which can be pretrained on diverse relational databases and directly applied to unseen datasets and tasks without task- or dataset-specific fine-tuning, or retrieval of in-context examples. RT (i) tokenizes cells with table/column metadata, (ii) is pretrained via masked token prediction, and (iii) utilizes a novel Relational Attention mechanism over columns, rows, and primary-foreign key links. Pretrained on RelBench datasets spanning tasks such as churn and sales forecasting, RT attains strong zero-shot performance, averaging 93% of fully supervised AUROC on binary classification tasks with a single forward pass of a 22M parameter model, as opposed to 84% for a 27B LLM. Fine-tuning yields state-of-the-art results with high sample efficiency. Our experiments show that RT's zero-shot transfer harnesses task-table context, relational attention patterns and schema semantics. Overall, RT provides a practical path toward foundation models for relational data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence. Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally, our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

<title>FlyLoRA: Boosting Task Decoupling and Parameter Efficiency via Implicit Rank-Wise Mixture-of-Experts</title>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference, resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises. Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

<title>On the Fairness of Privacy Protection: Measuring and Mitigating the Disparity of Group Privacy Risks for Differentially Private Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in DPML.

<title>HoMer: Addressing Heterogeneities by Modeling Sequential and Set-wise Contexts for CTR Prediction</title>

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which models behavior sequence and non-sequential features (e.g., user/item profiles or cross features) to infer user interest, underpins industrial recommender systems. However, most methods face three forms of heterogeneity that degrade predictive performance: (i) Feature Heterogeneity persists when limited sequence side features provide less granular interest representation compared to extensive non-sequential features, thereby impairing sequence modeling performance; (ii) Context Heterogeneity arises because a user's interest in an item will be influenced by other items, yet point-wise prediction neglects cross-item interaction context from the entire item set; (iii) Architecture Heterogeneity stems from the fragmented integration of specialized network modules, which compounds the model's effectiveness, efficiency and scalability in industrial deployments. To tackle the above limitations, we propose HoMer, a Homogeneous-Oriented TransforMer for modeling sequential and set-wise contexts. First, we align sequence side features with non-sequential features for accurate sequence modeling and fine-grained interest representation. Second, we shift the prediction paradigm from point-wise to set-wise, facilitating cross-item interaction in a highly parallel manner. Third, HoMer's unified encoder-decoder architecture achieves dual optimization through structural simplification and shared computation, ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining scalability with model size. Without arduous modification to the prediction pipeline, HoMer successfully scales up and outperforms our industrial baseline by 0.0099 in the AUC metric, and enhances online business metrics like CTR/RPM by 1.99%/2.46%. Additionally, HoMer saves 27% of GPU resources via preliminary engineering optimization, further validating its superiority and practicality.

Abstract: In cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), it is a common practice to tune hyperparameters in ideal simulated environments to maximize cooperative performance. However, policies tuned for cooperation often fail to maintain robustness and resilience under real-world uncertainties. Building trustworthy MARL systems requires a deep understanding of robustness, which ensures stability under uncertainties, and resilience, the ability to recover from disruptions--a concept extensively studied in control systems but largely overlooked in MARL. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study comprising over 82,620 experiments to evaluate cooperation, robustness, and resilience in MARL across 4 real-world environments, 13 uncertainty types, and 15 hyperparameters. Our key findings are: (1) Under mild uncertainty, optimizing cooperation improves robustness and resilience, but this link weakens as perturbations intensify. Robustness and resilience also varies by algorithm and uncertainty type. (2) Robustness and resilience do not generalize across uncertainty modalities or agent scopes: policies robust to action noise for all agents may fail under observation noise on a single agent. (3) Hyperparameter tuning is critical for trustworthy MARL: surprisingly, standard practices like parameter sharing, GAE, and PopArt can hurt robustness, while early stopping, high critic learning rates, and Leaky ReLU consistently help. By optimizing hyperparameters only, we observe substantial improvement in cooperation, robustness and resilience across all MARL backbones, with the phenomenon also generalizing to robust MARL methods across these backbones.

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable.

Abstract: Although quantum systems are generally described by quantum state vectors, we show that in certain cases their measurement processes can be reformulated as probabilistic equations expressed in terms of probabilistic state vectors. These probabilistic representations can, in turn, be approximated by the neural network dynamics of the Tensor Brain (TB) model.
  The Tensor Brain is a recently proposed framework for modeling perception and memory in the brain, providing a biologically inspired mechanism for efficiently integrating generated symbolic representations into reasoning processes.

Abstract: Multi-class wine classification presents fundamental trade-offs between model accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability - critical factors for production deployment in analytical chemistry. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study of One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the UCI Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 chemical features), comparing from-scratch gradient descent implementation against scikit-learn's optimized solvers and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity. Manual gradient descent achieves 92.59 percent mean test accuracy with smooth convergence, validating theoretical foundations, though scikit-learn provides 24x training speedup and 98.15 percent accuracy. Class-specific analysis reveals distinct chemical signatures with heterogeneous patterns where color intensity varies dramatically (0.31 to 16.50) across cultivars. L1 regularization produces 54-69 percent feature reduction with only 4.63 percent accuracy decrease, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance trade-offs. We propose an optimal 5-feature subset achieving 62 percent complexity reduction with estimated 92-94 percent accuracy, enabling cost-effective deployment with 80 dollars savings per sample and 56 percent time reduction. Statistical validation confirms robust generalization with sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for practitioners balancing comprehensive chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained environments.

arXiv:2510.15382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available at: https://github.com/Whiterrrrr/BREEZE.

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS} (\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance \underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components. The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM}) enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future underwater perception research.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a new method called "Q-Manipulation" (Q-M) for reward adaptation in reinforcement learning. The approach leverages existing source behaviors to adapt to a target reward function efficiently. By manipulating Q-functions and computing bounds based on the known relationship between source and target reward functions, Q-M enables action pruning in the target domain before learning begins. The iterative process of tightening these bounds, similar to value iteration, ensures that Q-M does not compromise the optimality of the returned policy in discrete domains. The method is proven to be efficient in terms of sample complexity and is evaluated in various synthetic and simulation domains, showcasing its effectiveness, generalizability, and practicality. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new solution to reward adaptation (RA) in reinforcement learning, where the agent adapts to a target reward function based on one or more existing source behaviors learned a priori under the same domain dynamics but different reward functions. While learning the target behavior from scratch is possible, it is often inefficient given the available source behaviors. Our work introduces a new approach to RA through the manipulation of Q-functions. Assuming the target reward function is a known function of the source reward functions, we compute bounds on the Q-function and present an iterative process (akin to value iteration) to tighten these bounds. Such bounds enable action pruning in the target domain before learning even starts. We refer to this method as "Q-Manipulation" (Q-M). The iteration process assumes access to a lite-model, which is easy to provide or learn. We formally prove that Q-M, under discrete domains, does not affect the optimality of the returned policy and show that it is provably efficient in terms of sample complexity in a probabilistic sense. Q-M is evaluated in a variety of synthetic and simulation domains to demonstrate its effectiveness, generalizability, and practicality.

Summary:<br />
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhancing reasoning capabilities. However, the inherent limitations of LLMs create a cycle where exploration is restricted, hindering learning. To address this, Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL) introduces checklist-style rubrics as explicit guidance during both exploration and exploitation phases. This framework provides external guidance for diverse responses and verifiable rewards for model training. Extensive experiments show RuscaRL's superiority in general reasoning tasks, exceeding performance of leading LLMs like GPT-4.1. Notably, RuscaRL significantly improves performance on HealthBench-500 benchmarks. The fine-tuned variant on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves impressive results, surpassing other LLMs. The code for RuscaRL is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the Best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500, surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading LLMs including OpenAI-o3. Our code is available at https://github.com/IANNXANG/RuscaRL.

<div> Diffusion Probabilistic Models, Anisotropic Noise Operator, Spectrally Anisotropic Gaussian Diffusion, Score Relation, Empirical Results <br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces an anisotropic noise operator called Spectrally Anisotropic Gaussian Diffusion (SAGD) to incorporate inductive biases into Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs). By replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance, SAGD allows for emphasizing or suppressing designated frequency bands while keeping the forward process Gaussian. The derived score relation for anisotropic covariances shows that the learned score converges to the true data score as time approaches zero, reshaping the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, the induced anisotropy in SAGD outperforms standard diffusion across various vision datasets and enables selective omission of known corruptions in specific frequency bands. This demonstrates that carefully designed anisotropic forward noise can effectively tailor inductive bias in DPMs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings, allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor inductive bias in DPMs.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the impact of pre-training language models on downstream performance. It highlights the limitations of using cross-entropy loss as a predictor of success and introduces the concept of coverage as a more effective measure. The coverage principle is explained, showing how optimizing next-token prediction leads to better coverage and faster generalization compared to cross-entropy. The article also suggests practical interventions to improve coverage, including model selection, gradient normalization, and decoding strategies during testing. These interventions have provable benefits for enhancing the model's performance on specific tasks. Overall, the study provides insights into the importance of coverage in shaping the success of pre-trained language models and offers strategies for optimizing it for better performance. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Language models demonstrate remarkable abilities when pre-trained on large text corpora and fine-tuned for specific tasks, but how and why pre-training shapes the success of the final model remains poorly understood. Notably, although pre-training success is often quantified by cross-entropy loss, cross-entropy can be a poor predictor of downstream performance. Instead, we provide a theoretical perspective on this relationship through the lens of \emph{coverage}, which quantifies the probability mass the pre-trained model places on high-quality responses and which is necessary and sufficient for post-training and test-time scaling methods such as Best-of-N to succeed. Our main results develop an understanding of \emph{the coverage principle}, a phenomenon whereby next-token prediction (more generally, maximum likelihood) implicitly optimizes toward a model with good coverage. In particular, we uncover a mechanism that explains the power of coverage in predicting downstream performance: \emph{coverage generalizes faster than cross-entropy}, avoiding spurious dependence on problem-dependent parameters such as the sequence length. We also study practical algorithmic interventions with provable benefits for improving coverage, including (i) model/checkpoint selection procedures, (ii) gradient normalization schemes, and (iii) test-time decoding strategies.

<div> Validation, Ethical AI, Mental Health, Suicide Risk, Chatbots
Summary:
VERA-MH is an automated system designed for evaluating the safety of AI chatbots used in mental health contexts, focusing on suicide risk. The system involves a user-agent model simulating conversations with the chatbot and a judge-agent scoring the interactions based on a rubric developed by clinicians and experts. The process aims to ensure realistic user interactions and accurate evaluation of the chatbot's performance. Initial evaluations have been conducted on GPT-5, Claude Opus, and Claude Sonnet, with findings used for further development. The next steps include robust clinical validation, iteration, and refining scoring mechanisms. Community feedback on both technical and clinical aspects of the evaluation is solicited for further improvement. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce VERA-MH (Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health), an automated evaluation of the safety of AI chatbots used in mental health contexts, with an initial focus on suicide risk.
  Practicing clinicians and academic experts developed a rubric informed by best practices for suicide risk management for the evaluation. To fully automate the process, we used two ancillary AI agents. A user-agent model simulates users engaging in a mental health-based conversation with the chatbot under evaluation. The user-agent role-plays specific personas with pre-defined risk levels and other features. Simulated conversations are then passed to a judge-agent who scores them based on the rubric. The final evaluation of the chatbot being tested is obtained by aggregating the scoring of each conversation.
  VERA-MH is actively under development and undergoing rigorous validation by mental health clinicians to ensure user-agents realistically act as patients and that the judge-agent accurately scores the AI chatbot. To date we have conducted preliminary evaluation of GPT-5, Claude Opus and Claude Sonnet using initial versions of the VERA-MH rubric and used the findings for further design development. Next steps will include more robust clinical validation and iteration, as well as refining actionable scoring. We are seeking feedback from the community on both the technical and clinical aspects of our evaluation.

<div> transport problem, verifiable test-time scaling, large language models, coverage, sampling algorithm

Summary:
This study investigates the impact of verification on test-time scaling for large language models. It explores the interaction between the generator's coverage, the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and the sub-optimality of the sampling algorithm. The researchers introduce a framework that frames verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem, revealing three distinct regimes in the sub-optimality-coverage curve: transport, policy improvement, and saturation. They also analyze two classes of sampling algorithms, sequential and batched, to understand how their computational complexities affect these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models support the theoretical findings, highlighting the importance of considering the interplay between coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality in test-time scaling with verification. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii) the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime -- where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime -- where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms -- sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models corroborate our theoretical findings.

<div> machine learning, clinical diagnosis, Bayesian Experimental Design, large language models, diagnostic uncertainty <br />
Summary:
The article introduces ACTMED, a diagnostic framework combining Bayesian Experimental Design with large language models to simulate real-world diagnostic reasoning. ACTMED assists clinicians in selecting the most informative tests for patients to reduce diagnostic uncertainty effectively. By integrating large language models, ACTMED can generate patient state distributions and update beliefs without structured training data. The framework allows clinicians to engage in the decision-making process, enhancing interpretability and clinical judgment. Evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that ACTMED optimizes test selection, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource utilization. This approach represents a significant advancement towards transparent, adaptive diagnostic systems aligned with clinicians' needs and applicable across various settings without relying heavily on domain-specific data. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.18988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design (BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data. Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on domain-specific data.

<div> shortcut behaviors, preference-based reward learning, reward hacking, reinforcement learning,  

Summary: 
The paper discusses the issue of reward hacking in preference-based reward models used in reinforcement learning from human feedback. These models often exploit shortcuts, such as response verbosity or agreeable tone, to achieve high reward scores, leading to over-optimization and a lack of generalization. The proposed method, Preference-based Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), addresses this problem by learning group-invariant kernels with feature maps. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM improves the accuracy of reward models on out-of-distribution tasks and reduces reliance on shortcuts in downstream policy models. This approach provides a robust framework for aligning large language models with human preference. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy) that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust framework for preference-based alignment.

Summary:<br /><br /> This study introduces the Music Understanding and Structural Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark to assess fundamental music perception skills using multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Four state-of-the-art models were evaluated against a large human baseline, revealing varying capabilities and a significant gap with human experts. Gemini Pro excelled in basic perception tasks, while Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 showed severe perceptual deficits. The use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting provided inconsistent and often detrimental results.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving development of more robust AI systems.

Summary:<br /><br /> This study evaluates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in assessing clinical trial reporting based on CONSORT standards. Two representative LLMs were analyzed under three prompt conditions, revealing differences in their cognitive and reasoning strategies. The models exhibited varying approaches to CONSORT items, prompt types, reasoning styles, uncertainty handling, and alternative interpretations. The findings emphasize the current limitations of LLMs in automating clinical compliance and stress the need to comprehend their cognitive adaptations and strategic behavior for developing more transparent and dependable medical AI. <div>

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare, the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

<div> Keywords: Reasoning models, Mode Selection, Early Exit, Computational burden, Zero-step thinking

Summary:
Mode Selection and Early Exit are proposed methods to reduce computational burden in reasoning models. Mode Selection decides between Long-CoT and Short-CoT using Thinking or NoThinking mode at the beginning of the reasoning process, while Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during inference. Both methods aim to reduce unnecessary computational overhead. Empirical studies show that prompt-based approaches struggle with limited hand-crafted information, while methods leveraging internal information perform better but lack stability. Existing methods relying solely on model information are found inadequate for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with limited information. The study highlights the challenges of effectively implementing Mode Selection in reasoning tasks. Further research is needed to develop more robust approaches for efficient reasoning model selection in various scenarios.

arXiv:2510.19176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT (Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast, approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task.

<div> Keywords: web agents, evaluation framework, action graph, benchmark datasets, efficiency-aware evaluation<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces WebGraphEval, a novel evaluation framework for web agents that abstracts trajectories into a weighted action graph. This framework enables the analysis of multiple agents on benchmark datasets like WebArena without the need for environment modifications. By encoding actions, identifying recurring behaviors, and applying structural analyses, WebGraphEval can highlight inefficiencies and critical decision points that traditional metrics may overlook. Evaluations on various web agents demonstrate the framework's ability to capture cross-model regularities, showcase redundancy, and pinpoint important decision nodes. Overall, by treating web interactions as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval provides a comprehensive methodology for efficient, multi-path evaluation of web agents.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.19205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware evaluation of web agents.

Summary: This study evaluates ChatGPT's performance in the legal domain compared to a Regex baseline. While ChatGPT has the necessary knowledge, it lacks the ability to reason and provide comprehensive solutions, highlighting a major limitation. In tasks such as extracting key legal passages, artificial intelligence struggles due to its lack of all-encompassing understanding and reasoning. This limitation underscores the uniqueness of human intelligence in the legal field. <div>
arXiv:2510.19261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies, providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the concept of precedential constraint in AI and Law, which is a key aspect of case-based reasoning. It introduces a generalized notion of the reason model that allows for inconsistent precedents. Existing argumentative explanation methods for reasoning with consistent precedents do not apply to this generalized framework. To address this gap, the paper proposes an extension of the derivation state argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain reasoning based on the generalized reason model. This extension aims to provide argumentative explanations for decision-making processes that involve inconsistent precedents in order to enhance transparency and understanding in AI and Law applications. <div>
arXiv:2510.19263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model, there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to the generalized notion of the reason model.

Summary:
In this study, the researchers investigate whether large language model (LLM) agents can replicate the intricate social dynamics seen in human online interactions, shaped by factors such as homophily and reciprocity. They introduce a multi-agent LLM simulation framework where agents engage in interactions, evaluate each other, and adapt their behavior through in-context learning supported by a coaching signal. By designing behavioral reward functions that mimic human online engagement drivers, such as social interaction and emotional support, the study aims to understand how network structures and group formations emerge through individual decision-making processes. The experiments demonstrate that coached LLM agents exhibit stable interaction patterns, form social ties, and develop network structures resembling real online communities. This framework provides a structured platform for exploring collective dynamics in LLM populations and offers insights into the alignment or divergence of artificial agents from human-like social behavior.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity, and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social behavior.

Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL) addresses the challenges of non-stationary environments by maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt to new tasks. This approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enhances knowledge transfer efficiency.

Experimental results on three benchmarks show that CKA-RL outperforms existing methods with a 4.20% improvement in overall performance and an 8.02% increase in forward transfer.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL), which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters. Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall performance and 8.02% in forward transfer.

Summary: 
The article introduces MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate multi-hop, end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents operating within a hierarchical Model-Context Protocol ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often overlook challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server orchestration, leading to overly positive evaluations. MSC-Bench addresses these gaps by creating ground truth using 'equal function sets', enabling objective metrics like F1 score and reducing reliance on LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, the benchmark systematically tests agent capabilities, from single-tool orchestration to complex cross-server planning, and assesses robustness to out-of-scope requests. Experimental results highlight that rigid hierarchies can impede performance without co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents show weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench offers a diagnostic framework to uncover these limitations and direct the development of more capable and efficient tool-using agents. <div>

arXiv:2510.19429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans' implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

<div> Keywords: natural language comprehension, linguistic instructions, ambiguity, distributional aligned learning, semantic alignment <br />
Summary: 
Distributional Aligned Learning (DAIL) is a novel method designed to improve the performance of intelligent agents in language-conditioned tasks by addressing the issue of ambiguity in linguistic instructions. DAIL consists of two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. The value distribution estimation mechanism of DAIL enhances task differentiability, while the semantic alignment module captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions. The method is shown to effectively resolve instruction ambiguities and outperform baseline methods on structured and visual observation benchmarks. The theoretical results presented support the effectiveness of DAIL in enhancing algorithmic performance in tasks requiring natural language comprehension. The implementation of DAIL is available on GitHub for further exploration and utilization. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks, severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically, we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions. Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities, achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/RunpengXie/Distributional-Aligned-Learning.

<div> Keywords: deep search agents, e-commerce benchmark, hierarchical rule application, Harmonized System Code, performance gap

Summary:
Effective deep search agents need to apply complex rules, such as legal clauses and tariff rules, in addition to accessing open-domain knowledge. To address the lack of evaluation in this area, the HSCodeComp benchmark has been introduced. This benchmark assesses deep search agents in hierarchical rule application by predicting 10-digit Harmonized System Codes (HSCode) based on product descriptions. The benchmark includes 632 product entries from diverse categories and human-annotated HSCodes. Results show that current agents struggle with this task, with the best-performing agent achieving only 46.8% accuracy compared to human experts at 95.0%. The challenges of hierarchical rule application are highlighted, and scaling at test time does not significantly improve agent performance. The gap in performance between agents and human experts underscores the need for improvement in deep reasoning capabilities for real-world applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses, medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories, with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source, and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides, detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application, and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

Summary:<br />
AgentSense is a new framework for web-based participatory urban sensing that integrates large language models (LLMs) and a multi-agent evolution system to improve adaptivity and explainability. It combines classical planning with iterative refinement to assign sensing tasks based on dynamic urban conditions and worker preferences, while providing natural language explanations for transparency and trust. Experiments using two mobility datasets and various disturbances show that AgentSense outperforms traditional methods in adaptivity and explainability. Compared to single-agent LLM baselines, it achieves better performance and robustness with more reasonable explanations. This work represents a significant advancement in creating adaptive and explainable urban sensing systems for web-based applications. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness, while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

<br />
The article presents a graph-based engine designed to provide chord tone soloing suggestions for guitar students. Chord tone soloing involves using only the notes within the current chord when improvising over a chord progression, a fundamental practice in jazz guitar theory. The engine generates chord-tone arpeggios and constructs a weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in the progression. Edge weights between nodes represent optimal transition tones between consecutive chords. The shortest path through the graph is calculated to create a chord-tone soloing line. The article also discusses a user-friendly system for guitar students to input and output data to practice chord tone soloing.

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

Summary: 
This article introduces a new approach to win prediction in e-sports using Artificial Intelligence. The focus is on real-time streaming data analysis, with input controlled over sliding windows to capture game changes as they happen. The system achieves an accuracy rate of over 90%, outperforming existing solutions. The explainable nature of the predictions enhances trust and can be valuable for ranking and recommender systems. By incorporating visualization techniques, the model offers a unique perspective on data patterns for informed decision-making in the dynamic e-sports industry.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently, this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature. Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters trust in the outcome predictions.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, probabilistic rule learning, neuro-symbolic reasoning, rule generation, iterative refinement

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in proposing rules in natural language for rule learning, eliminating the need for a predefined predicate space. The RLIE framework integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn weighted rules through a four-stage process. Rule generation by the LLM, followed by logistic regression to assign probabilistic weights, iterative refinement based on prediction errors, and evaluation of the weighted rule set. Applying learned rules directly outperforms methods using LLMs for rule injection, highlighting the strength of LLMs in semantic interpretation over precise probabilistic integration. This study emphasizes the potential and limitations of LLMs in inductive reasoning and demonstrates the effectiveness of coupling LLMs with classic probabilistic rule combination methods for more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning. 

<br /><br />Summary: Large Language Models can propose rules in natural language, coupling them with probabilistic rule learning in the RLIE framework to learn weighted rules. Applying these rules directly results in superior performance, highlighting the strength of LLMs in semantic interpretation. However, using LLMs for rule injection may lead to a degradation in accuracy, showcasing their limitations in precise probabilistic integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive reasoning and emphasizes the importance of integrating LLMs with classic probabilistic rule combination methods for robust neuro-symbolic reasoning. <div>
arXiv:2510.19698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language, sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules. RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

<br />
Memo is a novel approach for training transformer-based policies in reinforcement learning tasks that require long-term memory. It addresses the challenge of maintaining contextualization in environments with overwhelming visual inputs by incorporating memory creation and retrieval mechanisms through periodic summarization tokens. By interleaving these tokens with model inputs, Memo surpasses traditional transformer models and recurrent models in performance on gridworld meta-RL and multi-object navigation tasks. It demonstrates enhanced compute and storage efficiency while offering better generalization to longer contexts during inference and robustness in streaming settings where historical context needs to be truncated. Memo's ability to compress and abstract irrelevant input data ensures agents can effectively utilize a lifetime of experience to make informed decisions over extended timeframes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks, visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories. Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient. Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be truncated to fit inference constraints.

Summary:
PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks) is introduced as a new benchmark to evaluate proactivity in LLM-based agents. The benchmark assesses the agents' ability to search for issues, identify bottlenecks, and execute resolutions autonomously across various sources and timeframes. Testing leading LLMs and agentic frameworks, PROBE reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle to perform well on this benchmark. GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1 achieve the best end-to-end performance of 40%. The analysis also uncovers the relative capabilities of each model and common failure modes. These findings underscore the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems and suggest potential areas for future research and improvement.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and expose promising future research directions.

The article introduces WorldTest, a protocol for evaluating model-learning agents that separates reward-free exploration from a scored test phase in a different but related environment. This protocol aims to assess agents' ability to learn world models that support various downstream tasks without being anchored to next-frame prediction. AutumnBench, a suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments with 129 tasks, was used to compare human participants and frontier models. The results showed that humans outperformed the models, and scaling compute had mixed effects on performance across different environments. WorldTest provides a template for evaluating what agents learn about environment dynamics, focusing on reward-free exploration, derived tests, and behavior-based scoring. AutumnBench highlights the substantial room for improvement in world-model learning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in world-model learning.

<div> limits, Symbol Grounding Problem, formal proofs, meaning, non-algorithmic

Summary:
This paper presents a unified theory on the logical limits of the Symbol Grounding Problem by synthesizing formal proofs. It argues that meaning in a formal system must originate from an external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic process. Firstly, purely symbolic systems lacking external connections cannot establish a consistent foundation for meaning due to self-referential paradoxes. Secondly, systems with a finite, static set of pre-established meanings are shown to be inherently incomplete. Thirdly, connecting internal symbols to external meanings requires an axiomatic, meta-level update rather than logical inference within the system. Lastly, any attempt to automate this update process using a fixed external algorithm results in a larger, yet equally incomplete, system. These conclusions highlight the open-ended, non-algorithmic nature of meaning grounding, revealing a fundamental limitation akin to Godel's incompleteness theorem for self-contained intelligent systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20409v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper synthesizes a series of formal proofs to construct a unified theory on the logical limits of the Symbol Grounding Problem. We demonstrate through a four-stage argument that meaning within a formal system must arise from a process that is external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic. First, we prove that any purely symbolic system, devoid of external connections, cannot internally establish a consistent foundation for meaning due to self-referential paradoxes. Second, we extend this limitation to systems with any finite, static set of pre-established meanings, proving they are inherently incomplete. Third, we demonstrate that the very "act" of connecting an internal symbol to an external meaning cannot be a product of logical inference within the system but must be an axiomatic, meta-level update. Finally, we prove that any attempt to automate this update process using a fixed, external "judgment" algorithm will inevitably construct a larger, yet equally incomplete, symbolic system. Together, these conclusions formally establish that the grounding of meaning is a necessarily open-ended, non-algorithmic process, revealing a fundamental, G\"odel-style limitation for any self-contained intelligent system.

Abstract: The transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical Imaging (MI) is well recognized. Yet despite promising reports in research settings, many AI tools fail to achieve clinical adoption in practice. In fact, more generally, there is a documented 17-year average delay between evidence generation and implementation of a technology1. Implementation science (IS) may provide a practical, evidence-based framework to bridge the gap between AI development and real-world clinical imaging use that helps shorten this lag through systematic frameworks, strategies, and hybrid research designs. We outline challenges specific to AI adoption in MI workflows, including infrastructural, educational, and cultural barriers. We highlight the complementary roles of effectiveness research and implementation research, emphasizing hybrid study designs and the role of integrated KT (iKT), stakeholder engagement, and equity-focused co-creation in designing sustainable and generalizable solutions. We discuss integration of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) frameworks in MI towards usable AI. Adopting IS is not only a methodological advancement; it is a strategic imperative for accelerating translation of innovation into improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Entity Linking involves detecting and linking entity mentions in natural language texts to a knowledge graph. Traditional methods use a two-step process with separate models for entity recognition and disambiguation, which can be computationally intensive and less effective. We propose a fine-tuned model that jointly integrates entity recognition and disambiguation in a unified framework. Furthermore, our approach leverages large language models to enrich the context of entity mentions, yielding better performance in entity disambiguation. We evaluated our approach on benchmark datasets and compared with several baselines. The evaluation results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on out-of-domain datasets.

Summary: <br />
This article discusses the use of small language models (MiniLMs) for efficient and cost-effective information retrieval in geoscience literature. The author created a corpus of high-quality sentences from top geoscience journals and demonstrated that MiniLMs can extract domain-specific information accurately and quickly. Unlike large language models, MiniLMs provide precise and expert-verified information, particularly with quantitative findings. Additionally, MiniLMs can analyze emotional tone and identify topical clusters within sentences, making them valuable for tracking research trends and evolution within the geoscience community. The applications of MiniLMs in geoscience include fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction analyses, and educational purposes. MiniLMs offer significant potential in enhancing information retrieval and analysis in geoscience literature. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large language models (LLMs), are transforming how scientists engage with the literature. While the adoption of LLMs is increasing, concerns remain regarding potential information biases and computational costs. Rather than LLMs, I developed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of precise, rapid, and cost-effective information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature using freely available small language models (MiniLMs). A curated corpus of approximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading peer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and Earth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was constructed. MiniLMs enable a computationally efficient approach for extracting relevant domain-specific information from these corpora through semantic search techniques and sentence-level indexing. This approach, unlike LLMs such as ChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying substantial amounts of expert-verified information with established, multi-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative findings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and topical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM provides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research priorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities. Overall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for applications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction analyses, and educational purposes.

Summary:
CodeCRDT introduces an observation-driven coordination pattern for multi-agent systems, allowing agents to coordinate by monitoring shared state rather than explicit message passing. This approach utilizes Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to enable concurrent code generation with strong eventual consistency. Evaluation results show a speedup of up to 21.1% on certain tasks, but also a slowdown of up to 39.4% on others, with 100% convergence and zero merge failures. The study reveals semantic conflict rates of 5-10% and trade-offs between quality and performance. It offers empirical insights into when parallel coordination in stochastic systems succeeds or fails based on task structure. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent LLM systems fail to realize parallel speedups due to costly coordination. We present CodeCRDT, an observation-driven coordination pattern where agents coordinate by monitoring a shared state with observable updates and deterministic convergence, rather than explicit message passing. Using Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), CodeCRDT enables lock-free, conflict-free concurrent code generation with strong eventual consistency. Evaluation across 600 trials (6 tasks, 50 runs per mode) shows both benefits and trade-offs: up to 21.1% speedup on some tasks, up to 39.4% slowdown on others, and 100% convergence with zero merge failures. The study formalizes observation-driven coordination for stochastic LLM agents, revealing semantic conflict rates (5-10%) and quality-performance tradeoffs, and provides empirical characterization of when parallel coordination succeeds versus fails based on task structure.

<div> Keywords: CosmoCore, reinforcement learning, code generation, affective signals, language models

Summary: 
CosmoCore is a neuroscience-inspired reinforcement learning architecture that enhances code generation in large language models by integrating affective signals. The architecture tags code generation trajectories with valence and surprise using a multi-layer perceptron, prioritizing high-negative valence episodes for replay during off-policy updates. This approach reduces hallucinated code and accelerates self-correction significantly. Experiments on code generation benchmarks and simulations show promising results, with validations using Hugging Face models in a PySpark environment. Ablations confirm the effectiveness of valence tagging in boosting curiosity during exploration and the benefits of pruning in mitigating inefficiency. Overall, CosmoCore extends reinforcement learning from human feedback for emotionally aware code assistants, with applications in IDEs and data pipelines. The code and custom mini-world simulation are also released for replication and further research. 

<br /><br />Summary: CosmoCore integrates affective signals in reinforcement learning to enhance code generation in large language models, reducing errors and speeding up self-correction. The architecture prioritizes negative valence episodes for replay, resulting in a significant reduction in hallucinated code. Experiments and validations demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, with ablations confirming the benefits of valence tagging and pruning. This emotionally aware code assistant framework has potential applications in IDEs and data pipelines, offering a new perspective on reinforcement learning in code generation tasks. <div>

Abstract: We introduce CosmoCore, a neuroscience-inspired reinforcement learning (RL) architecture that integrates affective signals to enhance code generation in large language models (LLMs). Motivated by human and animal learning where embarrassment from mistakes drives rapid correction, as observed in training a puppy to avoid repeating errors after a single scolding CosmoCore tags code generation trajectories with valence and surprise using a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP). High-negative valence (cringe) episodes, such as buggy code outputs, are prioritized in a Dream Queue for five-fold replay during off-policy updates, while low-surprise successes are pruned to prevent overconfidence and buffer bloat. Evaluated on code generation benchmarks like HumanEval and BigCodeBench, alongside simulations with a custom data pipeline environment, CosmoCore reduces hallucinated code (e.g., syntax errors or logical bugs) by 48\% and accelerates self-correction by 45\%. Local experiments using Hugging Face models in a PySpark environment validate these gains, with code snippets provided for replication. Ablations confirm valence tagging boosts curiosity in exploration, and pruning mitigates inefficiency. This framework extends RL from human feedback (RLHF) for more emotionally aware code assistants, with applications in IDEs and data pipelines. Code and the custom mini-world simulation are released.

Using the Bauplan Function-as-a-Service runtime and its Eudoxia simulator, the researchers frame scheduler design as an iterative generate-and-verify loop. This process involves an LLM proposing a Python policy, which is then evaluated on standardized traces by the simulator, with structured feedback guiding subsequent generations. The system architecture is detailed, and preliminary results show throughput improvements across multiple models.

Abstract: We explore AI-driven distributed-systems policy design by combining stochastic code generation from large language models (LLMs) with deterministic verification in a domain-specific simulator. Using a Function-as-a-Service runtime (Bauplan) and its open-source simulator (Eudoxia) as a case study, we frame scheduler design as an iterative generate-and-verify loop: an LLM proposes a Python policy, the simulator evaluates it on standardized traces, and structured feedback steers subsequent generations. This setup preserves interpretability while enabling targeted search over a large design space. We detail the system architecture and report preliminary results on throughput improvements across multiple models. Beyond early gains, we discuss the limits of the current setup and outline next steps; in particular, we conjecture that AI will be crucial for scaling this methodology by helping to bootstrap new simulators.

Summary:<br /><br />This study analyzed how six large language models provide career guidance for entry-level computing roles across ten African countries. Technical skills like cloud computing and programming were consistent, but differences were seen in non-technical competencies. Models varied in recognizing country-specific factors and struggled with cultural sensitivity and infrastructure considerations. Open-source models showed better contextual awareness and balance between technical and professional skills compared to proprietary ones. The findings highlight the need for decolonial approaches to AI education in Africa to address Western-centric biases and cater to local needs. The study suggests that cost-effective open-source models, like Llama and DeepSeek, outperformed proprietary models in offering relevant career guidance for African computing students. <div>

Abstract: Employers increasingly expect graduates to utilize large language models (LLMs) in the workplace, yet the competencies needed for computing roles across Africa remain unclear given varying national contexts. This study examined how six LLMs, namely ChatGPT 4, DeepSeek, Gemini, Claude 3.5, Llama 3, and Mistral AI, describe entry-level computing career expectations across ten African countries. Using the Computing Curricula 2020 framework and drawing on Digital Colonialism Theory and Ubuntu Philosophy, we analyzed 60 LLM responses to standardized prompts. Technical skills such as cloud computing and programming appeared consistently, but notable differences emerged in how models addressed non-technical competencies, particularly ethics and responsible AI use. Models varied considerably in recognizing country-specific factors, including local technology ecosystems, language requirements, and national policies. Open-source models demonstrated stronger contextual awareness and a better balance between technical and professional skills, earning top scores in nine of ten countries. Still, all models struggled with cultural sensitivity and infrastructure considerations, averaging only 35.4% contextual awareness. This first broad comparison of LLM career guidance for African computing students uncovers entrenched infrastructure assumptions and Western-centric biases, creating gaps between technical recommendations and local needs. The strong performance of cost-effective open-source models (Llama: 4.47/5; DeepSeek: 4.25/5) compared to proprietary alternatives (ChatGPT 4: 3.90/5; Claude: 3.46/5) challenges assumptions about AI tool quality in resource-constrained settings. Our findings highlight how computing competency requirements vary widely across Africa and underscore the need for decolonial approaches to AI in education that emphasize contextual relevance

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating multilingual text and source code has only increased the imperative for machine-generated content detectors to be accurate and efficient across domains. Current detectors, predominantly utilizing zero-shot methods, such as Fast DetectGPT or GPTZero, either incur high computational cost or lack sufficient accuracy, often with a trade-off between the two, leaving room for further improvement. To address these gaps, we propose the fine-tuning of encoder-only Small Language Models (SLMs), in particular, the pre-trained models of RoBERTA and CodeBERTa using specialized datasets on source code and other natural language to prove that for the task of binary classification, SLMs outperform LLMs by a huge margin whilst using a fraction of compute. Our encoders achieve AUROC $= 0.97$ to $0.99$ and macro-F1 $0.89$ to $0.94$ while reducing latency by $8$-$12\times$ and peak VRAM by $3$-$5\times$ at $512$-token inputs. Under cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations (paraphrase, back-translation; code formatting/renaming), performance retains $\geq 92%$ of clean AUROC. We release training and evaluation scripts with seeds and configs; a reproducibility checklist is also included.

Summary:
This research introduces a 3D optimization framework for AI inference scaling that considers accuracy, cost, and latency constraints. Traditional 1D and 2D approaches do not account for cost and latency limitations when optimizing AI inference scaling. The new framework evaluates four optimization methods using Monte Carlo simulations across various scenarios and large language models. The results show that knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization is preferred when precision is a priority. The framework allows for environment-adaptive selection of the inference scaling factor k, providing a theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling in different operational contexts. This multi-objective optimization approach captures a feasible space that traditional methods overlook, enabling more effective decision-making in AI inference scaling. <br /> <div>

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse operational contexts.

Summary: 
The study focuses on utilizing social media data from Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic to analyze public discourse. It introduces a model-agnostic framework called TM-Rephrase, which uses large language models to rephrase tweets into more standardized language before topic modeling. Two rephrasing strategies, general- and colloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, are investigated on a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related tweets. Results show that TM-Rephrase improves topic modeling performance, specifically enhancing topic coherence, uniqueness, and diversity while reducing redundancy across various algorithms. The colloquial-to-formal strategy proves most effective, particularly for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This approach offers a valuable enhancement for public health-related social media analysis, contributing insights into understanding public discourse during health crises and potentially extending to other critical domains.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter (now X) provide rich data for analyzing public discourse, especially during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the brevity, informality, and noise of social media short texts often hinder the effectiveness of traditional topic modeling, producing incoherent or redundant topics that are often difficult to interpret. To address these challenges, we have developed \emph{TM-Rephrase}, a model-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to rephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language prior to topic modeling. Using a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts, we investigate the effects of two rephrasing strategies, general- and colloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, on multiple topic modeling methods. Results demonstrate that \emph{TM-Rephrase} improves three metrics measuring topic modeling performance (i.e., topic coherence, topic uniqueness, and topic diversity) while reducing topic redundancy of most topic modeling algorithms, with the colloquial-to-formal strategy yielding the greatest performance gains and especially for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This study contributes to a model-agnostic approach to enhancing topic modeling in public health related social media analysis, with broad implications for improved understanding of public discourse in health crisis as well as other important domains.

Summary:
- High-quality pre-training data is essential for large language models, considering both factual reliability and semantic value.
- Top-scored data selection approaches can lead to performance degradation, necessitating a more diverse selection strategy.
- The Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection (ODiS) algorithm is proposed to maintain both quality and diversity during data selection.
- ODiS evaluates data across multiple dimensions and utilizes Principal Component Analysis to decorrelate these metrics.
- Models trained with ODiS-selected data demonstrate significant improvements in downstream benchmarks, emphasizing the importance of diversity-aware data selection for large language models.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection (ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores, enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension, thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data selection for LLMs.

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for (i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions (BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and {Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences, reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift; (ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning (CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by 15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings. Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for extreme contamination.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced by large language models in terms of undesirable behaviors such as fairness issues, inconsistency, and the amplification of harmful content. Current methods to address these problems are expensive, irreversible, and slow to adapt. The proposed solution is a dynamic, reversible pruning-based framework that detects and masks context-aware neuron activations to modulate their influence during generation. This inference-time approach enables fine-grained, memory-aware bias mitigation across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues, leading to more coherent behavior and dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI. <div>

Although training-time or data-centric methods attempt to reduce these effects, they are computationally expensive, irreversible once deployed, and slow to adapt to new conversational contexts. Pruning-based methods provide a flexible and transparent way to reduce bias by adjusting the neurons responsible for certain behaviors. However, most existing approaches are static; once a neuron is removed, the model loses the ability to adapt when the conversation or context changes. To address this, we propose a dynamic, reversible, pruning-based framework that detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking to modulate their influence during generation. Our inference-time solution provides fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation with knowledge-preserved, more coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues, enabling dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal models, omni models, benchmark, uni-modal understanding, cross-modal performance

Summary:
The article discusses the progression of Multimodal Large Language models towards unifying visual, audio, and language modalities to create omni models. The correlation between uni-modal and omni-modal understanding is still unclear, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation for the evolution of omni model intelligence. A new benchmark, MultiModal All in One Benchmark (MMAO-Bench), is proposed to assess both uni-modal and omni-modal capabilities. This benchmark includes 1880 human-curated samples covering 44 task types and introduces a novel multi-step open-ended question type for evaluating complex reasoning tasks. Experimental results indicate a compositional law between cross-modal and uni-modal performance, with omni-modal capability acting as a bottleneck for weak models but providing synergistic enhancement for strong models. The MMAO-Bench aims to drive the advancement of omni models by offering a diverse and high-quality evaluation platform.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms undermines trust among individuals and hinders informed decision making. This paper shows an explainable and computationally efficient pipeline to detect misinformation using transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs). We optimize both RoBERTa and DistilBERT using a two-step strategy: first, we freeze the backbone and train only the classification head; then, we progressively unfreeze the backbone layers while applying layer-wise learning rate decay. On two real-world benchmark datasets, COVID Fake News and FakeNewsNet GossipCop, we test the proposed approach with a unified protocol of preprocessing and stratified splits. To ensure transparency, we integrate the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) at the token level to present token-level rationales and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) at the global feature attribution level. It demonstrates that DistilBERT achieves accuracy comparable to RoBERTa while requiring significantly less computational resources. This work makes two key contributions: (1) it quantitatively shows that a lightweight PLM can maintain task performance while substantially reducing computational cost, and (2) it presents an explainable pipeline that retrieves faithful local and global justifications without compromising performance. The results suggest that PLMs combined with principled fine-tuning and interpretability can be an effective framework for scalable, trustworthy misinformation detection.

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning (ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research, experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a noise-robust Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards (RLVR). It addresses the issue of noise from inconsistent or erroneous rewards by explicitly modeling reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. The method applies noise correction to debias the learning signal, resulting in unbiased gradient estimates. Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate individual-level noise, with the correction strategy enhancing this robustness. Empirical results demonstrate consistent improvements in math and code tasks, with significant gains in accuracy under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, providing theoretical insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards (RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO) framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates. Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness. Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

Summary:
The article proposes three innovative approaches for multiscale learning to model and predict the dynamics of complex systems. The first approach integrates neural networks with the Partition of Unity method to decompose dynamics into local components and accurately predict both macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second approach employs the Singular Value Decomposition to extract dominant modes that separate macro- and micro-scale dynamics. Additionally, the article introduces a Sparse High-Order SVD method to reconstruct multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. These approaches ensure accurate capture of both coarse and fine dynamics, making the framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale phenomena. Furthermore, the framework is adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete observations, providing an approximation and interpretation of all time scales present in the phenomena under study.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks, to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro- and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time scales present in the phenomena under study.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement learning, large language models, off-policy settings, entropy, adaptive clipping

Summary:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for enhancing large language models (LLMs) but faces challenges in off-policy settings where stale data is used for training.
- The imbalance in optimization leads to negative-advantage samples dominating the policy gradient, hindering useful behaviors.
- The fixed clipping mechanism in PPO-like objectives limits entropy-increasing updates, promoting over-exploitation over exploration.
- BAlanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO) dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to rebalance positive and negative contributions, maintain entropy, and stabilize RL optimization.
- BAPO outperforms open-source counterparts and leading proprietary systems on AIME benchmarks, achieving fast, stable, and data-efficient training. 

<br /><br />Summary: BAPO addresses challenges in off-policy RL settings by balancing optimization, adapting clipping bounds, and improving exploration. It outperforms other models on AIME benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results and surpassing leading proprietary systems. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i) an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions; and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025 benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

Summary: 
The article discusses the importance of course syllabi in shaping the learning experience, particularly in computing courses that address fairness and ethics in AI, ML, and algorithmic design. The need for inclusive, transparent, and critical thinking-promoting expectations is emphasized. Manual syllabus evaluation can be time-consuming and inconsistent, prompting the development of a justice-oriented scoring rubric. A large language model was used to evaluate syllabi from multiple perspectives, including instructor, department chair, institutional reviewer, and external evaluator. Thematic trends across the courses were identified through this analysis. The multiperspective evaluation highlighted role-specific priorities and gaps in curricula design for AI/ML and related computing courses. Insights from the evaluation provide concrete directions for enhancing the design and delivery of fairness, ethics, and justice content in these courses. <div>

Abstract: Course syllabi set the tone and expectations for courses, shaping the learning experience for both students and instructors. In computing courses, especially those addressing fairness and ethics in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and algorithmic design, it is imperative that we understand how approaches to navigating barriers to fair outcomes are being addressed.These expectations should be inclusive, transparent, and grounded in promoting critical thinking. Syllabus analysis offers a way to evaluate the coverage, depth, practices, and expectations within a course. Manual syllabus evaluation, however, is time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. To address this, we developed a justice-oriented scoring rubric and asked a large language model (LLM) to review syllabi through a multi-perspective role simulation. Using this rubric, we evaluated 24 syllabi from four perspectives: instructor, departmental chair, institutional reviewer, and external evaluator. We also prompted the LLM to identify thematic trends across the courses. Findings show that multiperspective evaluation aids us in noting nuanced, role-specific priorities, leveraging them to fill hidden gaps in curricula design of AI/ML and related computing courses focused on fairness and ethics. These insights offer concrete directions for improving the design and delivery of fairness, ethics, and justice content in such courses.

<div> Keyword: Stutter, Speech Recognition, Waveform-to-Waveform Model, End-to-End, AI Systems

Summary: 
Stuttering affects over 70 million people globally, but current automatic speech systems struggle with accurately transcribing stuttered speech. Traditional methods for correcting stuttering involve multi-stage ASR and TTS pipelines, leading to distortions in the output. This study introduces StutterZero and StutterFormer, the first end-to-end waveform-to-waveform models that convert stuttered speech into fluent speech while predicting its transcription simultaneously. Both models are trained on synthesized paired stuttered-fluent data and evaluated on unseen speakers from the FluencyBank dataset. StutterZero shows a 24% decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) and a 31% improvement in semantic similarity compared to existing models, while StutterFormer achieves even better results with a 28% decrease in WER and a 34% improvement in BERTScore. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of direct end-to-end stutter-to-fluent speech conversion, opening up new possibilities for inclusive human-computer interaction, speech therapy, and accessibility-focused AI systems.

Abstract: Over 70 million people worldwide experience stuttering, yet most automatic speech systems misinterpret disfluent utterances or fail to transcribe them accurately. Existing methods for stutter correction rely on handcrafted feature extraction or multi-stage automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) pipelines, which separate transcription from audio reconstruction and often amplify distortions. This work introduces StutterZero and StutterFormer, the first end-to-end waveform-to-waveform models that directly convert stuttered speech into fluent speech while jointly predicting its transcription. StutterZero employs a convolutional-bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder with attention, whereas StutterFormer integrates a dual-stream Transformer with shared acoustic-linguistic representations. Both architectures are trained on paired stuttered-fluent data synthesized from the SEP-28K and LibriStutter corpora and evaluated on unseen speakers from the FluencyBank dataset. Across all benchmarks, StutterZero had a 24% decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) and a 31% improvement in semantic similarity (BERTScore) compared to the leading Whisper-Medium model. StutterFormer achieved better results, with a 28% decrease in WER and a 34% improvement in BERTScore. The results validate the feasibility of direct end-to-end stutter-to-fluent speech conversion, offering new opportunities for inclusive human-computer interaction, speech therapy, and accessibility-oriented AI systems.

<div> parameter-efficient fine-tuning, NeuroAda, memory efficiency, fine-grained adaptation, state-of-the-art performance

Summary: 
NeuroAda is a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that balances memory efficiency and fine-grained adaptation. It identifies important parameters and introduces bypass connections for them, allowing for precise and effective adaptation while keeping memory consumption low. By updating only bypass connections during fine-tuning, the original model parameters remain frozen. Empirical results on various tasks show that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal trainable parameters (as low as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$) and reduces CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. The approach offers a unique solution to the trade-off between representational capacity and memory efficiency in fine-tuning methods. Code for NeuroAda is available at https://github.com/FightingFighting/NeuroAda.git. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former, such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e., connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen. Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here: https://github.com/FightingFighting/NeuroAda.git.

Abstract: Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by the challenge of verifying responses, limiting assessments to tasks like mathematics, programming, and short-form question-answering. However, many real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000 response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA. We build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3 orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community. Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving only 65.9\% overall performance. Furthermore, we identify notable performance disparities between proprietary and open-weight models and provide insights into the role that extended thinking plays in addressing complex, professional-domain tasks.

Abstract: Estimation of signed distance functions (SDFs) from point cloud data has been shown to benefit many robot autonomy capabilities, including localization, mapping, motion planning, and control. Methods that support online and large-scale SDF reconstruction tend to rely on discrete volumetric data structures, which affect the continuity and differentiability of the SDF estimates. Recently, using implicit features, neural network methods have demonstrated high-fidelity and differentiable SDF reconstruction but they tend to be less efficient, can experience catastrophic forgetting and memory limitations in large environments, and are often restricted to truncated SDFs. This work proposes $\nabla$-SDF, a hybrid method that combines an explicit prior obtained from gradient-augmented octree interpolation with an implicit neural residual. Our method achieves non-truncated (Euclidean) SDF reconstruction with computational and memory efficiency comparable to volumetric methods and differentiability and accuracy comparable to neural network methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \methodname{} outperforms the state of the art in terms of accuracy and efficiency, providing a scalable solution for downstream tasks in robotics and computer vision.

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1, a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains) further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception, prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example, using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to 66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96% accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal image analysis.

Abstract: Domestic AI agents faces ethical, autonomy, and inclusion challenges, particularly for overlooked groups like children, elderly, and Neurodivergent users. We present the Plural Voices Model (PVM), a novel single-agent framework that dynamically negotiates multi-user needs through real-time value alignment, leveraging diverse public datasets on mental health, eldercare, education, and moral reasoning. Using human+synthetic curriculum design with fairness-aware scenarios and ethical enhancements, PVM identifies core values, conflicts, and accessibility requirements to inform inclusive principles. Our privacy-focused prototype features adaptive safety scaffolds, tailored interactions (e.g., step-by-step guidance for Neurodivergent users, simple wording for children), and equitable conflict resolution. In preliminary evaluations, PVM outperforms multi-agent baselines in compliance (76% vs. 70%), fairness (90% vs. 85%), safety-violation rate (0% vs. 7%), and latency. Design innovations, including video guidance, autonomy sliders, family hubs, and adaptive safety dashboards, demonstrate new directions for ethical and inclusive domestic AI, for building user-centered agentic systems in plural domestic contexts. Our Codes and Model are been open sourced, available for reproduction: https://github.com/zade90/Agora

Abstract: Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and empirical methodologies that neglect individual patient variations, leading to suboptimal health outcomes. We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN), T-learner counterfactual models, and contextual bandit approaches to provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured datasets (93.2% accuracy), uses CTGANs to produce realistic synthetic patient data (55% accuracy via two-sample verification), deploys T-learners to forecast patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000 rounds, exceeding other reference methods. This comprehensive system overcomes cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational effectiveness, and constitutes notable progress toward individualized medicine adapted to specific patient characteristics.

Abstract: Dataset availability and quality remain critical challenges in machine learning, especially in domains where data are scarce, expensive to acquire, or constrained by privacy regulations. Fields such as healthcare, biomedical research, and cybersecurity frequently encounter high data acquisition costs, limited access to annotated data, and the rarity or sensitivity of key events. These issues-collectively referred to as the dataset challenge-hinder the development of accurate and generalizable machine learning models in such high-stakes domains. To address this, we introduce FlexiDataGen, an adaptive large language model (LLM) framework designed for dynamic semantic dataset generation in sensitive domains. FlexiDataGen autonomously synthesizes rich, semantically coherent, and linguistically diverse datasets tailored to specialized fields. The framework integrates four core components: (1) syntactic-semantic analysis, (2) retrieval-augmented generation, (3) dynamic element injection, and (4) iterative paraphrasing with semantic validation. Together, these components ensure the generation of high-quality, domain-relevant data. Experimental results show that FlexiDataGen effectively alleviates data shortages and annotation bottlenecks, enabling scalable and accurate machine learning model development.

Abstract: Simulations constitute a fundamental component of medical and nursing education and traditionally employ standardized patients (SP) and high-fidelity manikins to develop clinical reasoning and communication skills. However, these methods require substantial resources, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this study, we introduce CLiVR, a Conversational Learning system in Virtual Reality that integrates large language models (LLMs), speech processing, and 3D avatars to simulate realistic doctor-patient interactions. Developed in Unity and deployed on the Meta Quest 3 platform, CLiVR enables trainees to engage in natural dialogue with virtual patients. Each simulation is dynamically generated from a syndrome-symptom database and enhanced with sentiment analysis to provide feedback on communication tone. Through an expert user study involving medical school faculty (n=13), we assessed usability, realism, and perceived educational impact. Results demonstrated strong user acceptance, high confidence in educational potential, and valuable feedback for improvement. CLiVR offers a scalable, immersive supplement to SP-based training.

Abstract: While much research has shown the presence of AI's "under-the-hood" biases (e.g., algorithmic, training data, etc.), what about "over-the-hood" inclusivity biases: barriers in user-facing AI products that disproportionately exclude users with certain problem-solving approaches? Recent research has begun to report the existence of such biases -- but what do they look like, how prevalent are they, and how can developers find and fix them? To find out, we conducted a field study with 3 AI product teams, to investigate what kinds of AI inclusivity bugs exist uniquely in user-facing AI products, and whether/how AI product teams might harness an existing (non-AI-oriented) inclusive design method to find and fix them. The teams' work resulted in identifying 6 types of AI inclusivity bugs arising 83 times, fixes covering 47 of these bug instances, and a new variation of the GenderMag inclusive design method, GenderMag-for-AI, that is especially effective at detecting certain kinds of AI inclusivity bugs.

<title>REPAIR Approach for Social-based City Reconstruction Planning in case of natural disasters</title>

Abstract: Natural disasters always have several effects on human lives. It is challenging for governments to tackle these incidents and to rebuild the economic, social and physical infrastructures and facilities with the available resources (mainly budget and time). Governments always define plans and policies according to the law and political strategies that should maximise social benefits. The severity of damage and the vast resources needed to bring life back to normality make such reconstruction a challenge. This article is the extension of our previously published work by conducting comprehensive comparative analysis by integrating additional deep learning models plus random agent which is used as a baseline. Our prior research introduced a decision support system by using the Deep Reinforcement Learning technique for the planning of post-disaster city reconstruction, maximizing the social benefit of the reconstruction process, considering available resources, meeting the needs of the broad community stakeholders (like citizens' social benefits and politicians' priorities) and keeping in consideration city's structural constraints (like dependencies among roads and buildings). The proposed approach, named post disaster REbuilding plAn ProvIdeR (REPAIR) is generic. It can determine a set of alternative plans for local administrators who select the ideal one to implement, and it can be applied to areas of any extension. We show the application of REPAIR in a real use case, i.e., to the L'Aquila reconstruction process, damaged in 2009 by a major earthquake.

<title>PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions</title>

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr, SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable, interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics (including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus, DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type (using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as assistive text generation.

<title>Local Guidance for Configuration-Based Multi-Agent Pathfinding</title>

Abstract: Guidance is an emerging concept that improves the empirical performance of real-time, sub-optimal multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) methods. It offers additional information to MAPF algorithms to mitigate congestion on a global scale by considering the collective behavior of all agents across the entire workspace. This global perspective helps reduce agents' waiting times, thereby improving overall coordination efficiency. In contrast, this study explores an alternative approach: providing local guidance in the vicinity of each agent. While such localized methods involve recomputation as agents move and may appear computationally demanding, we empirically demonstrate that supplying informative spatiotemporal cues to the planner can significantly improve solution quality without exceeding a moderate time budget. When applied to LaCAM, a leading configuration-based solver, this form of guidance establishes a new performance frontier for MAPF.

<title>What Makes a Good Curriculum? Disentangling the Effects of Data Ordering on LLM Mathematical Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally - the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

Abstract: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) behave when faced with discrepancies between their parametric knowledge and conflicting information contained in a prompt. Building on prior question-answering (QA) research, we extend the investigation of knowledge conflicts to the realm of code generation. We propose a domain-agnostic framework for constructing and interpreting such conflicts, along with a novel evaluation method and dataset tailored to code conflict scenarios. Our experiments indicate that sufficiently large LLMs encode the notion of a knowledge conflict in their parameters, enabling us to detect knowledge conflicts with up to \textbf{80.65\%} accuracy. Building on these insights, we show that activation-level steering can achieve up to a \textbf{12.6\%} improvement in steering success over a random baseline. However, effectiveness depends critically on balancing model size, task domain, and steering direction. The experiment code and data will be made publicly available after acceptance.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96% accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs) to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

Abstract: Path planning for a robotic system in high-dimensional cluttered environments needs to be efficient, safe, and adaptable for different environments and hardware. Conventional methods face high computation time and require extensive parameter tuning, while prior learning-based methods still fail to generalize effectively. The primary goal of this research is to develop a path planning framework capable of generalizing to unseen environments and new robotic manipulators without the need for retraining. We present GADGET (Generalizable and Adaptive Diffusion-Guided Environment-aware Trajectory generation), a diffusion-based planning model that generates joint-space trajectories conditioned on voxelized scene representations as well as start and goal configurations. A key innovation is GADGET's hybrid dual-conditioning mechanism that combines classifier-free guidance via learned scene encoding with classifier-guided Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety shaping, integrating environment awareness with real-time collision avoidance directly in the denoising process. This design supports zero-shot transfer to new environments and robotic embodiments without retraining. Experimental results show that GADGET achieves high success rates with low collision intensity in spherical-obstacle, bin-picking, and shelf environments, with CBF guidance further improving safety. Moreover, comparative evaluations indicate strong performance relative to both sampling-based and learning-based baselines. Furthermore, GADGET provides transferability across Franka Panda, Kinova Gen3 (6/7-DoF), and UR5 robots, and physical execution on a Kinova Gen3 demonstrates its ability to generate safe, collision-free trajectories in real-world settings.

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover, real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments, without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

Abstract: LLMs often fail to handle temporal knowledge conflicts--contradictions arising when facts evolve over time within their training data. Existing studies evaluate this phenomenon through benchmarks built on structured knowledge bases like Wikidata, but they focus on widely-covered, easily-memorized popular entities and lack the dynamic structure needed to fairly evaluate LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates. We introduce evolveQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on temporally evolving knowledge, constructed from 3 real-world, time-stamped corpora: AWS updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports. Our framework identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates. Through extensive evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across 3 knowledge probing formats, we demonstrate significant performance drops of up to 31% on evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

Abstract: The financial market is known to be highly sensitive to news. Therefore, effectively incorporating news data into quantitative trading remains an important challenge. Existing approaches typically rely on manually designed rules and/or handcrafted features. In this work, we directly use the news sentiment scores derived from large language models, together with raw price and volume data, as observable inputs for reinforcement learning. These inputs are processed by sequence models such as recurrent neural networks or Transformers to make end-to-end trading decisions. We conduct experiments using the cryptocurrency market as an example and evaluate two representative reinforcement learning algorithms, namely Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The results demonstrate that our news-aware approach, which does not depend on handcrafted features or manually designed rules, can achieve performance superior to market benchmarks. We further highlight the critical role of time-series information in this process.

<title>Imbalanced Gradients in RL Post-Training of Multi-Task LLMs</title>

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly. This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents a question answering system that operates exclusively on a knowledge graph retrieval without relying on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs). Instead, a small paraphraser model is used to paraphrase the entity relationship edges retrieved from querying the knowledge graph. The proposed pipeline is divided into two main stages. The first stage involves pre-processing a document to generate sets of question-answer (QA) pairs. The second stage converts these QAs into a knowledge graph from which graph-based retrieval is performed using embeddings and fuzzy techniques. The graph is queried, re-ranked, and paraphrased to generate a final answer. This work includes an evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge on the CRAG benchmark, which resulted in accuracies of 71.9% and 54.4% using LLAMA-3.2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, respectively.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are $\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks. Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally, the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node distinctiveness.

Abstract: The rapid ascent of artificial intelligence (AI) is often portrayed as a revolution born from computer science and engineering. This narrative, however, obscures a fundamental truth: the theoretical and methodological core of AI is, and has always been, statistical. This paper systematically argues that the field of statistics provides the indispensable foundation for machine learning and modern AI. We deconstruct AI into nine foundational pillars-Inference, Density Estimation, Sequential Learning, Generalization, Representation Learning, Interpretability, Causality, Optimization, and Unification-demonstrating that each is built upon century-old statistical principles. From the inferential frameworks of hypothesis testing and estimation that underpin model evaluation, to the density estimation roots of clustering and generative AI; from the time-series analysis inspiring recurrent networks to the causal models that promise true understanding, we trace an unbroken statistical lineage. While celebrating the computational engines that power modern AI, we contend that statistics provides the brain-the theoretical frameworks, uncertainty quantification, and inferential goals-while computer science provides the brawn-the scalable algorithms and hardware. Recognizing this statistical backbone is not merely an academic exercise, but a necessary step for developing more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy intelligent systems. We issue a call to action for education, research, and practice to re-embrace this statistical foundation. Ignoring these roots risks building a fragile future; embracing them is the path to truly intelligent machines. There is no machine learning without statistical learning; no artificial intelligence without statistical thought.

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods. Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster than existing approaches.

Abstract: LLMs have recently demonstrated strong potential in simulating online shopper behavior. Prior work has improved action prediction by applying SFT on action traces with LLM-generated rationales, and by leveraging RL to further enhance reasoning capabilities. Despite these advances, current approaches rely on text-based inputs and overlook the essential role of visual perception in shaping human decision-making during web GUI interactions. In this paper, we investigate the integration of visual information, specifically webpage screenshots, into behavior simulation via VLMs, leveraging OPeRA dataset. By grounding agent decision-making in both textual and visual modalities, we aim to narrow the gap between synthetic agents and real-world users, thereby enabling more cognitively aligned simulations of online shopping behavior. Specifically, we employ SFT for joint action prediction and rationale generation, conditioning on the full interaction context, which comprises action history, past HTML observations, and the current webpage screenshot. To further enhance reasoning capabilities, we integrate RL with a hierarchical reward structure, scaled by a difficulty-aware factor that prioritizes challenging decision points. Empirically, our studies show that incorporating visual grounding yields substantial gains: the combination of text and image inputs improves exact match accuracy by more than 6% over text-only inputs. These results indicate that multi-modal grounding not only boosts predictive accuracy but also enhances simulation fidelity in visually complex environments, which captures nuances of human attention and decision-making that text-only agents often miss. Finally, we revisit the design space of behavior simulation frameworks, identify key methodological limitations, and propose future research directions toward building efficient and effective human behavior simulators.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from structured data, yet fairness in regression tasks remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting, (ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities without sacrificing performance. Code is available at https://github.com/sybeam27/FnRGNN.

Abstract: With the goal of improving the security of Internet protocols, we seek faster, semi-automatic methods to discover new vulnerabilities in protocols such as DNS, BGP, and others. To this end, we introduce the LLM-Assisted Protocol Attack Discovery (LAPRAD) methodology, enabling security researchers with some DNS knowledge to efficiently uncover vulnerabilities that would otherwise be hard to detect.
  LAPRAD follows a three-stage process. In the first, we consult an LLM (GPT-o1) that has been trained on a broad corpus of DNS-related sources and previous DDoS attacks to identify potential exploits. In the second stage, a different LLM automatically constructs the corresponding attack configurations using the ReACT approach implemented via LangChain (DNS zone file generation). Finally, in the third stage, we validate the attack's functionality and effectiveness.
  Using LAPRAD, we uncovered three new DDoS attacks on the DNS protocol and rediscovered two recently reported ones that were not included in the LLM's training data. The first new attack employs a bait-and-switch technique to trick resolvers into caching large, bogus DNSSEC RRSIGs, reducing their serving capacity to as little as 6%. The second exploits large DNSSEC encryption algorithms (RSA-4096) with multiple keys, thereby bypassing a recently implemented default RRSet limit. The third leverages ANY-type responses to produce a similar effect.
  These variations of a cache-flushing DDoS attack, called SigCacheFlush, circumvent existing patches, severely degrade resolver query capacity, and impact the latest versions of major DNS resolver implementations.

Abstract: Designing adaptive mechanisms to align individual and collective interests remains a central challenge in artificial social intelligence. Existing methods often struggle with modeling heterogeneous agents possessing persistent latent traits (e.g., skills, preferences) and dealing with complex multi-agent system dynamics. These challenges are compounded by the critical need for high sample efficiency due to costly real-world interactions. World Models, by learning to predict environmental dynamics, offer a promising pathway to enhance mechanism design in heterogeneous and complex systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel method named SWM-AP (Social World Model-Augmented Mechanism Design Policy Learning), which learns a social world model hierarchically modeling agents' behavior to enhance mechanism design. Specifically, the social world model infers agents' traits from their interaction trajectories and learns a trait-based model to predict agents' responses to the deployed mechanisms. The mechanism design policy collects extensive training trajectories by interacting with the social world model, while concurrently inferring agents' traits online during real-world interactions to further boost policy learning efficiency. Experiments in diverse settings (tax policy design, team coordination, and facility location) demonstrate that SWM-AP outperforms established model-based and model-free RL baselines in cumulative rewards and sample efficiency.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled data, the complexity of the disease, and the constraints related to data privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of big data in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and 99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications in early Alzheimer disease detection.

We propose a model where knowledge of strategies can be specified on a fine-grained level. In particular, it is possible to distinguish first-order, higher-order, and common knowledge of strategies. We illustrate the effect of higher-order knowledge of strategies by studying the game Hanabi. Further, we show that common knowledge of strategies is necessary to solve the consensus problem. Finally, we study the decidability of the model checking problem.

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

arXiv:2510.19322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective communication (CC) is widely adopted for large-scale distributed machine learning (DML) training workloads. DML's predictable traffic pattern provides a great oppotunity for applying optical network technology. Existing optical interconnects-based CC schemes adopt ``one-shot network reconfiguration'', which provisions static high-capacity topologies for an entire collective operation -- sometimes for a full training iteration. However, this approach faces significant scalability limitations when supporting more complex and efficient CC algorithms required for modern workloads: the ``one-shot'' strategies either demand excessive resource overprovisioning or suffer performance degradation due to rigid resource allocation.
  To address these challenges, we propose SWOT, a demand-aware optical network framework. SWOT employs ``intra-collective reconfiguration'' and can dynamically align network resources with CC traffic patterns. SWOT incorporates a novel scheduling technique that overlaps optical switch reconfigurations with ongoing transmissions, and improves communication efficiency. SWOT introduce a lightweight collective communication shim that enables coordinated optical network configuration and transmission scheduling while supporting seamless integration with existing CC libraries. Our simulation results demonstrate SWOT's significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Text summarization is a crucial task that requires the simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives, including consistency, coherence, relevance, and fluency, which presents considerable challenges. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL), few studies have focused on optimizing the multi-objective problem of summarization through RL based on LLMs. In this paper, we introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel optimization strategy that dynamically adjusts the scores between groups during the reward process in RL by using the hypervolume method. This method guides the model's optimization to progressively approximate the pareto front, thereby generating balanced summaries across multiple objectives. Experimental results on several representative summarization datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms group relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and shows more balanced performance across different dimensions. Moreover, a 7B foundation model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task, while maintaining a shorter generation length. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ai4business-LiAuto/HVO.git

Abstract: The rapid evolution of smart cities has increased the reliance on intelligent interconnected services to optimize infrastructure, resources, and citizen well-being. Agentic AI has emerged as a key enabler by supporting autonomous decision-making and adaptive coordination, allowing urban systems to respond in real time to dynamic conditions. Its benefits are evident in areas such as transportation, where the integration of traffic data, weather forecasts, and safety sensors enables dynamic rerouting and a faster response to hazards. However, its deployment across heterogeneous smart city ecosystems raises critical governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) challenges, including accountability, data privacy, and regulatory alignment within decentralized infrastructures. Evaluation of SORA-ATMAS with three domain agents (Weather, Traffic, and Safety) demonstrated that its governance policies, including a fallback mechanism for high-risk scenarios, effectively steer multiple LLMs (GPT, Grok, DeepSeek) towards domain-optimized, policy-aligned outputs, producing an average MAE reduction of 35% across agents. Results showed stable weather monitoring, effective handling of high-risk traffic plateaus 0.85, and adaptive trust regulation in Safety/Fire scenarios 0.65. Runtime profiling of a 3-agent deployment confirmed scalability, with throughput between 13.8-17.2 requests per second, execution times below 72~ms, and governance delays under 100 ms, analytical projections suggest maintained performance at larger scales. Cross-domain rules ensured safe interoperability, with traffic rerouting permitted only under validated weather conditions. These findings validate SORA-ATMAS as a regulation-aligned, context-aware, and verifiable governance framework that consolidates distributed agent outputs into accountable, real-time decisions, offering a resilient foundation for smart-city management.

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to 75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains, offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models has revolutionized tasks across domains, including the automation of legal document analysis, a critical component of modern contract management systems. This paper presents a comprehensive implementation of LLM-enhanced metadata extraction for contract review, focusing on the automatic detection and annotation of salient legal clauses. Leveraging both the publicly available Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD) and proprietary contract datasets, our work demonstrates the integration of advanced LLM methodologies with practical applications. We identify three pivotal elements for optimizing metadata extraction: robust text conversion, strategic chunk selection, and advanced LLM-specific techniques, including Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting and structured tool calling. The results from our experiments highlight the substantial improvements in clause identification accuracy and efficiency. Our approach shows promise in reducing the time and cost associated with contract review while maintaining high accuracy in legal clause identification. The results suggest that carefully optimized LLM systems could serve as valuable tools for legal professionals, potentially increasing access to efficient contract review services for organizations of all sizes.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series, specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0. Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8 operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%. Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: This pilot study traces students' reflections on the use of AI in a 13-week foundational design course enrolling over 500 first-year engineering and architecture students at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. The course was an AI-enhanced design course, with several interventions to equip students with AI based design skills. Students were required to reflect on whether the technology was used as a tool (instrumental assistant), a teammate (collaborative partner), or neither (deliberate non-use). By foregrounding this three-way lens, students learned to use AI for innovation rather than just automation and to reflect on agency, ethics, and context rather than on prompt crafting alone. Evidence stems from coursework artefacts: thirteen structured reflection spreadsheets and eight illustrated briefs submitted, combined with notes of teachers and researchers. Qualitative coding of these materials reveals shared practices brought about through the inclusion of Gen-AI, including accelerated prototyping, rapid skill acquisition, iterative prompt refinement, purposeful "switch-offs" during user research, and emergent routines for recognizing hallucinations. Unexpectedly, students not only harnessed Gen-AI for speed but (enabled by the tool-teammate-neither triage) also learned to reject its outputs, invent their own hallucination fire-drills, and divert the reclaimed hours into deeper user research, thereby transforming efficiency into innovation. The implications of the approach we explore shows that: we can transform AI uptake into an assessable design habit; that rewarding selective non-use cultivates hallucination-aware workflows; and, practically, that a coordinated bundle of tool access, reflection, role tagging, and public recognition through competition awards allows AI based innovation in education to scale without compromising accountability.

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast -- point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

Abstract: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which poses security concerns on these models. Adversarial examples are crafted by applying subtle but intentionally worst-case modifications to examples from the dataset, leading the model to output a different answer from the original example. In this paper, adversarial examples are formed in an exactly opposite manner, which are significantly different from the original examples but result in the same answer. We propose a novel set of algorithms to produce such adversarial examples, including the negative iterative fast gradient sign method (NI-FGSM) and the negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM), along with their momentum variants: the negative momentum iterative fast gradient sign method (NMI-FGSM) and the negative momentum iterative fast gradient method (NMI-FGM). Adversarial examples constructed by these methods could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems in certain occasions. Moreover, our results show that the adversarial examples are not merely distributed in the neighbourhood of the examples from the dataset; instead, they are distributed extensively in the sample space.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical data scarcity that hinders the practical deployment of learning to defer (L2D) systems to the population. We introduce a context-aware, semi-supervised framework that uses meta-learning to generate expert-specific embeddings from only a few demonstrations. We demonstrate the efficacy of a dual-purpose mechanism, where these embeddings are used first to generate a large corpus of pseudo-labels for training, and subsequently to enable on-the-fly adaptation to new experts at test-time. The experiment results on three different datasets confirm that a model trained on these synthetic labels rapidly approaches oracle-level performance, validating the data efficiency of our approach. By resolving a key training bottleneck, this work makes adaptive L2D systems more practical and scalable, paving the way for human-AI collaboration in real-world environments. To facilitate reproducibility and address implementation details not covered in the main text, we provide our source code and training configurations at https://github.com/nil123532/learning-to-defer-to-a-population-with-limited-demonstrations.

Abstract: We present M3-SLU, a new multimodal large language model (MLLM) benchmark for evaluating multi-speaker, multi-turn spoken language understanding. While recent models show strong performance in speech and text comprehension, they still struggle with speaker-attributed reasoning, the ability to understand who said what and when in natural conversations. M3-SLU is built from four open corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, and AMI) and comprises over 12,000 validated instances with paired audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes two tasks: (1) Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and (2) Speaker Attribution via Utterance Matching. We provide baseline results for both cascaded pipelines and end-to-end MLLMs, evaluated using an LLM-as-Judge and accuracy metrics. Results show that while models can capture what was said, they often fail to identify who said it, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware dialogue understanding. M3-SLU offers as a challenging benchmark to advance research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

Abstract: The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness, without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

Abstract: We present the Massive Legal Embedding Benchmark (MLEB), the largest, most diverse, and most comprehensive open-source benchmark for legal information retrieval to date. MLEB consists of ten expert-annotated datasets spanning multiple jurisdictions (the US, UK, EU, Australia, Ireland, and Singapore), document types (cases, legislation, regulatory guidance, contracts, and literature), and task types (search, zero-shot classification, and question answering). Seven of the datasets in MLEB were newly constructed in order to fill domain and jurisdictional gaps in the open-source legal information retrieval landscape. We document our methodology in building MLEB and creating the new constituent datasets, and release our code, results, and data openly to assist with reproducible evaluations.

Abstract: With the advancements in hardware, software, and large language model technologies, the interaction between humans and operating systems has evolved from the command-line interface to the rapidly emerging AI agent interactions. Building an operating system (OS) agent capable of executing user instructions and faithfully following user desires is becoming a reality. In this technical report, we present ColorAgent, an OS agent designed to engage in long-horizon, robust interactions with the environment while also enabling personalized and proactive user interaction. To enable long-horizon interactions with the environment, we enhance the model's capabilities through step-wise reinforcement learning and self-evolving training, while also developing a tailored multi-agent framework that ensures generality, consistency, and robustness. In terms of user interaction, we explore personalized user intent recognition and proactive engagement, positioning the OS agent not merely as an automation tool but as a warm, collaborative partner. We evaluate ColorAgent on the AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks, achieving success rates of 77.2% and 50.7%, respectively, establishing a new state of the art. Nonetheless, we note that current benchmarks are insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of OS agents and propose further exploring directions in future work, particularly in the areas of evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security.

Abstract: Identifying which text spans refer to entities -- mention detection -- is both foundational for information extraction and a known performance bottleneck. We introduce ToMMeR, a lightweight model (<300K parameters) probing mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers. Across 13 NER benchmarks, ToMMeR achieves 93\% recall zero-shot, with over 90\% precision using an LLM as a judge showing that ToMMeR rarely produces spurious predictions despite high recall. Cross-model analysis reveals that diverse architectures (14M-15B parameters) converge on similar mention boundaries (DICE >75\%), confirming that mention detection emerges naturally from language modeling. When extended with span classification heads, ToMMeR achieves near SOTA NER performance (80-87\% F1 on standard benchmarks). Our work provides evidence that structured entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently recovered with minimal parameters.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of speech deepfakes has raised serious concerns, particularly in real-world scenarios such as telephone fraud and identity theft. While many anti-spoofing systems have demonstrated promising performance on lab-generated synthetic speech, they often fail when confronted with physical replay attacks-a common and low-cost form of attack used in practical settings. Our experiments show that models trained on existing datasets exhibit severe performance degradation, with average accuracy dropping to 59.6% when evaluated on replayed audio. To bridge this gap, we present EchoFake, a comprehensive dataset comprising more than 120 hours of audio from over 13,000 speakers, featuring both cutting-edge zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) speech and physical replay recordings collected under varied devices and real-world environmental settings. Additionally, we evaluate three baseline detection models and show that models trained on EchoFake achieve lower average EERs across datasets, indicating better generalization. By introducing more practical challenges relevant to real-world deployment, EchoFake offers a more realistic foundation for advancing spoofing detection methods.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have become a popular paradigm of AI applications. However, trustworthiness issues in MAS remain a critical concern. Unlike challenges in single-agent systems, MAS involve more complex communication processes, making them susceptible to corruption attacks. To mitigate this issue, several defense mechanisms have been developed based on the graph representation of MAS, where agents represent nodes and communications form edges. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly focus on static graph defense, attempting to either detect attacks in a fixed graph structure or optimize a static topology with certain defensive capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic defense paradigm for MAS graph structures, which continuously monitors communication within the MAS graph, then dynamically adjusts the graph topology, accurately disrupts malicious communications, and effectively defends against evolving and diverse dynamic attacks. Experimental results in increasingly complex and dynamic MAS environments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MAS defense mechanisms, contributing an effective guardrail for their trustworthy applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/ChengcanWu/Monitoring-LLM-Based-Multi-Agent-Systems.

<title>FairNet: Dynamic Fairness Correction without Performance Loss via Contrastive Conditional LoRA</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19421</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge. Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of FairNet.

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout} posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification. The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

Abstract: A unified theory of quantitative abstraction is presented for probabilistic systems that links category theory, optimal transport, and quantitative modal logic. At its core is a canonical $ \varepsilon $-quotient endowed with a universal property: among all $ \varepsilon $-abstractions, it is the most informative one that respects a prescribed bound on value loss. This construction induces an adjunction between abstraction and realization functors $ (Q_{\varepsilon} \dashv R_{\varepsilon}) $, established via the Special Adjoint Functor Theorem, revealing a categorical duality between metric structure and logical semantics. A behavioral pseudometric is characterized as the unique fixed point of a Bellman-style operator, with contraction and Lipschitz properties proved in a coalgebraic setting. A quantitative modal $ \mu $-calculus is introduced and shown to be expressively complete for logically representable systems, so that behavioral distance coincides with maximal logical deviation. Compositionality under interface refinement is analyzed, clarifying how abstractions interact across system boundaries. An exact validation suite on finite Markov decision processes corroborates the contraction property, value-loss bounds, stability under perturbation, adversarial distinguishability, and scalability, demonstrating both robustness and computational feasibility. The resulting framework provides principled targets for state aggregation and representation learning, with mathematically precise guarantees for value-function approximation in stochastic domains.

<title>HybridEP: Scaling Expert Parallelism to Cross-Datacenter Scenario via Hybrid Expert/Data Transmission</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a popular architecture for scaling large models. However, the rapidly growing scale outpaces model training on a single DC, driving a shift toward a more flexible, cross-DC training paradigm. Under this, Expert Parallelism (EP) of MoE faces significant scalability issues due to the limited cross-DC bandwidth. Specifically, existing EP optimizations attempt to overlap data communication and computation, which has little benefit in low-bandwidth scenarios due to a much longer data communication time. Therefore, the trends of cross-DC EP scaling is fast becoming a critical roadblock to the continued growth of MoE models.
  To address this, we propose HybridEP, a modeling-guided framework to optimize EP under constrained bandwidth. Our key idea is to dynamically transform the spatial placement of experts to reduce data communication traffic and frequency, thereby minimizing EP's communication overheads. However, it is non-trivial to find the optimal solution because it complicates the original communication pattern by mixing data and expert communication. We therefore build a stream-based model to determine the optimal transmission ratio. Guided by this, we incorporate two techniques: (1) domain-based partition to construct the mapping between hybrid patterns and specific communication topology at GPU level, and (2) parameter-efficient migration to further refine this topology by reducing expert transmission overhead and enlarging the domain size. Combining all these designs, HybridEP can be considered as a more general EP with better scalability. Experimental results show that HybridEP outperforms existing state-of-the-art MoE training systems by up to 5.6x under constrained bandwidth. We further compare HybridEP and EP on large-scale simulations. HybridEP achieves up to 1.45x speedup with 1k DCs under different bandwidths.

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety. This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1) establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones influencing their feasibility.

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while maintaining the model's utility.

To address these challenges, we introduce KnowMol-100K, a large-scale dataset with 100K fine-grained molecular annotations across multiple levels, bridging the gap between molecules and textual descriptions. Additionally, we propose chemically-informative molecular representation, effectively addressing limitations in existing molecular representation strategies. Building upon these innovations, we develop KnowMol, a state-of-the-art multi-modal molecular large language model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KnowMol achieves superior performance across molecular understanding and generation tasks.

Abstract: Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module (IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to expensive manual annotation.

Abstract: Imitation learning has proven effective for training robots to perform complex tasks from expert human demonstrations. However, it remains limited by its reliance on high-quality, task-specific data, restricting adaptability to the diverse range of real-world object configurations and scenarios. In contrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations, partial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer broader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation learning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these challenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement learning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the performance of imitation learning policies. We show that while standard offline RL approaches can be ineffective at actually leveraging non-expert data under the sparse data coverage settings typically encountered in the real world, simple algorithmic modifications can allow for the utilization of this data, without significant additional assumptions. Our approach shows that broadening the support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented by offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery and generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations significantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies are successful when non-expert data is incorporated. Moreover, we show that these methods are able to leverage all collected data, including partial or suboptimal demonstrations, to bolster task-directed policy performance. This underscores the importance of algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data for robust policy learning in robotics.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a \textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the \emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

Abstract: Modeling realistic human behaviour to understand people's mode choices in order to propose personalised mobility solutions remains challenging. This paper presents an architecture for modeling realistic human mobility behavior in complex multimodal transport systems, demonstrated through a case study in Toulouse, France. We apply Large Language Models (LLMs) within an agent-based simulation to capture decision-making in a real urban setting. The framework integrates the GAMA simulation platform with an LLM-based generative agent, along with General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data for public transport, and OpenTripPlanner for multimodal routing. GAMA platform models the interactive transport environment, providing visualization and dynamic agent interactions while eliminating the need to construct the simulation environment from scratch. This design enables a stronger focus on developing generative agents and evaluating their performance in transport decision-making processes. Over a simulated month, results show that agents not only make context-aware transport decisions but also form habits over time. We conclude that combining LLMs with agent-based simulation offers a promising direction for advancing intelligent transportation systems and personalised multimodal mobility solutions. We also discuss some limitations of this approach and outline future work on scaling to larger regions, integrating real-time data, and refining memory models.

<title>From Prototypes to Sparse ECG Explanations: SHAP-Driven Counterfactuals for Multivariate Time-Series Multi-class Classification</title>

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining 81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection (13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical deployment.

<title>Optimizing the Unknown: Black Box Bayesian Optimization with Energy-Based Model and Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks. Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead, dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However, their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training across data silos. This federated data access complicates important data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are central to both practical applications and the development of optimization methods. While classical and quantum algorithms have been refined over decades, machine learning-assisted approaches are comparatively recent and have not yet consistently outperformed simple, state-of-the-art classical methods. Here, we focus on a class of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, specifically the challenge of finding minimum energy configurations in three-dimensional Ising spin glasses. We use a Global Annealing Monte Carlo algorithm that integrates standard local moves with global moves proposed via machine learning. We show that local moves play a crucial role in achieving optimal performance. Benchmarking against Simulated Annealing and Population Annealing, we demonstrate that Global Annealing not only surpasses the performance of Simulated Annealing but also exhibits greater robustness than Population Annealing, maintaining effectiveness across problem hardness and system size without hyperparameter tuning. These results provide, to our knowledge, the first clear and robust evidence that a machine learning-assisted optimization method can exceed the capabilities of classical state-of-the-art techniques in a combinatorial optimization setting.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space. These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at https://tekayanidham.github.io/timeline-page/.

<title>Multi-modal Co-learning for Earth Observation: Enhancing single-modality models via modality collaboration</title>

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO applications.

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a crucial aspect of incident management in large-scale cloud services. While the term root cause analysis or RCA has been widely used, different studies formulate the task differently. This is because the term "RCA" implicitly covers tasks with distinct underlying goals. For instance, the goal of localizing a faulty service for rapid triage is fundamentally different from identifying a specific functional bug for a definitive fix. However, previous surveys have largely overlooked these goal-based distinctions, conventionally categorizing papers by input data types (e.g., metric-based vs. trace-based methods). This leads to the grouping of works with disparate objectives, thereby obscuring the true progress and gaps in the field. Meanwhile, the typical audience of an RCA survey is either laymen who want to know the goals and big picture of the task or RCA researchers who want to figure out past research under the same task formulation. Thus, an RCA survey that organizes the related papers according to their goals is in high demand. To this end, this paper presents a goal-driven framework that effectively categorizes and integrates 135 papers on RCA in the context of cloud incident management based on their diverse goals, spanning the period from 2014 to 2025. In addition to the goal-driven categorization, it discusses the ultimate goal of all RCA papers as an umbrella covering different RCA formulations. Moreover, the paper discusses open challenges and future directions in RCA.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies, their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2) models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated. These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical practice.

Abstract: In the quest for scientific progress, communicating research is as vital as the discovery itself. Yet, researchers are often sidetracked by the manual, repetitive chore of building project webpages to make their dense papers accessible. While automation has tackled static slides and posters, the dynamic, interactive nature of webpages has remained an unaddressed challenge. To bridge this gap, we reframe the problem, arguing that the solution lies not in a single command, but in a collaborative, hierarchical process. We introduce $\textbf{AutoPage}$, a novel multi-agent system that embodies this philosophy. AutoPage deconstructs paper-to-page creation into a coarse-to-fine pipeline from narrative planning to multimodal content generation and interactive rendering. To combat AI hallucination, dedicated "Checker" agents verify each step against the source paper, while optional human checkpoints ensure the final product aligns perfectly with the author's vision, transforming the system from a mere tool into a powerful collaborative assistant. To rigorously validate our approach, we also construct $\textbf{PageBench}$, the first benchmark for this new task. Experiments show AutoPage not only generates high-quality, visually appealing pages but does so with remarkable efficiency in under 15 minutes for less than \$0.1. Code and dataset will be released at $\href{https://mqleet.github.io/AutoPage_ProjectPage/}{Webpage}$.

Abstract: With social media growth, users employ stylistic fonts and font-like emoji to express individuality, creating visually appealing text that remains human-readable. However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this human-model perception gap and propose a style-based attack, Style Attack Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech generation.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework, the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction, PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism, equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss. Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs. Code and model weights will be released at https://github.com/6550Zhao/Policy-World-Model.

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced the field of emotion recognition. However, there are still open challenges when exploring open-ended queries for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although current models offer good results, automatic emotion analysis in open texts presents significant challenges, such as contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and difficulty interpreting complex emotional expressions. These limitations make the direct application of generalist models difficult. Accordingly, this work compares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion detection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii) effectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact of emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain metrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition. Moreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt engineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These advancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and understanding of user behavior across various domains.

Abstract: Memory-efficient training of deep neural networks has become increasingly important as models grow larger while deployment environments impose strict resource constraints. We propose TraDy, a novel transfer learning scheme leveraging two key insights: layer importance for updates is architecture-dependent and determinable a priori, while dynamic stochastic channel selection provides superior gradient approximation compared to static approaches. We introduce a dynamic channel selection approach that stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict memory constraints, achieving up to 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight derivative sparsity, and 97% reduction in FLOPs for weight derivative computation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature) search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in MLLMs.

Abstract: Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on student learning, with extensive research examining how best to implement it in educational settings. Increasingly, feedback is being generated by artificial intelligence (AI), offering scalable and adaptive responses. Two widely studied approaches are directive feedback, which gives explicit explanations and reduces cognitive load to speed up learning, and metacognitive feedback which prompts learners to reflect, track their progress, and develop self-regulated learning (SRL) skills. While both approaches have clear theoretical advantages, their comparative effects on engagement, confidence, and quality of work remain underexplored. This study presents a semester-long randomised controlled trial with 329 students in an introductory design and programming course using an adaptive educational platform. Participants were assigned to receive directive, metacognitive, or hybrid AI-generated feedback that blended elements of both directive and metacognitive feedback. Results showed that revision behaviour differed across feedback conditions, with Hybrid prompting the most revisions compared to Directive and Metacognitive. Confidence ratings were uniformly high, and resource quality outcomes were comparable across conditions. These findings highlight the promise of AI in delivering feedback that balances clarity with reflection. Hybrid approaches, in particular, show potential to combine actionable guidance for immediate improvement with opportunities for self-reflection and metacognitive growth.

<title>Are Large Language Models Sensitive to the Motives Behind Communication?</title>

Abstract: Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world, they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner. We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

Abstract: Industrial and government organizations increasingly depend on data-driven analytics for workforce, finance, and regulated decision processes, where timeliness, cost efficiency, and compliance are critical. Distributed frameworks such as Spark and Flink remain effective for massive-scale batch or streaming analytics but introduce coordination complexity and auditing overheads that misalign with moderate-scale, latency-sensitive inference. Meanwhile, cloud providers now offer serverless GPUs, and models such as TabNet enable interpretable tabular ML, motivating new deployment blueprints for regulated environments. In this paper, we present a production-oriented Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) blueprint that integrates a single-node serverless GPU runtime with TabNet. The design leverages GPU acceleration for throughput, serverless elasticity for cost reduction, and feature-mask interpretability for IL4/FIPS compliance. We conduct benchmarks on the HR, Adult, and BLS datasets, comparing our approach against Spark and CPU baselines. Our results show that GPU pipelines achieve up to 4.5x higher throughput, 98x lower latency, and 90% lower cost per 1K inferences compared to Spark baselines, while compliance mechanisms add only ~5.7 ms latency with p99 < 22 ms. Interpretability remains stable under peak load, ensuring reliable auditability. Taken together, these findings provide a compliance-aware benchmark, a reproducible Helm-packaged blueprint, and a decision framework that demonstrate the practicality of secure, interpretable, and cost-efficient serverless GPU analytics for regulated enterprise and government settings.

Abstract: Agentic AI is poised to usher in a seismic paradigm shift in Software Engineering (SE). As technologists rush head-along to make agentic AI a reality, SE researchers are driven to establish agentic SE as a research area. While early visions of agentic SE are primarily focused on code-related activities, early empirical evidence calls for a consideration of a range of socio-technical concerns to make it work in practice. This paper contributes to the emerging community vision by: (a) recommending an expansion of its scope beyond code, toward a 'whole of process' vision, grounding it in SE foundations and evolution and emerging agentic SE frameworks, (b) proposing a preliminary set of values and principles to guide efforts, and (c) sharing guidance on designing/using well-defined vocabulary for agentic SE. It is hoped that these ideas will encourage community collaborations and steer the SE community towards laying strong foundations of agentic SE so its not only inevitable but also deliberate and desirable in the long run.

<title>Do Prompts Reshape Representations? An Empirical Study of Prompting Effects on Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Prompting is a common approach for leveraging LMs in zero-shot settings. However, the underlying mechanisms that enable LMs to perform diverse tasks without task-specific supervision remain poorly understood. Studying the relationship between prompting and the quality of internal representations can shed light on how pre-trained embeddings may support in-context task solving. In this empirical study, we conduct a series of probing experiments on prompt embeddings, analyzing various combinations of prompt templates for zero-shot classification. Our findings show that while prompting affects the quality of representations, these changes do not consistently correlate with the relevance of the prompts to the target task. This result challenges the assumption that more relevant prompts necessarily lead to better representations. We further analyze potential factors that may contribute to this unexpected behavior.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff, HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties. We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32 intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical, privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

<title>Learning Affordances at Inference-Time for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>

Abstract: Solving complex real-world control tasks often takes multiple tries: if we fail at first, we reflect on what went wrong, and change our strategy accordingly to avoid making the same mistake. In robotics, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) offer a promising path towards solving complex control tasks, but lack the ability to contextually and dynamically readjust behavior when they fail to accomplish a task. In this work, we introduce Learning from Inference-Time Execution (LITEN), which connects a VLA low-level policy to a high-level VLM that conditions on past experiences by including them in-context, allowing it to learn the affordances and capabilities of the low-level VLA. Our approach iterates between a reasoning phase that generates and executes plans for the low-level VLA, and an assessment phase that reflects on the resulting execution and draws useful conclusions to be included in future reasoning contexts. Unlike similar approaches to self-refinement in non-robotics domains, LITEN must reflect on unstructured real-world robot trajectories (e.g., raw videos), which requires structured guiderails during assessment. Our experimental results demonstrate LITEN is able to effectively learn from past experience to generate plans that use high-affordance instructions to accomplish long-horizon tasks.

<title>A Survey on Cache Methods in Diffusion Models: Toward Efficient Multi-Modal Generation</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent \textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of \textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

<title>SmartSwitch: Advancing LLM Reasoning by Overcoming Underthinking via Promoting Deeper Thought Exploration</title>

Abstract: The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks. However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the performance of various large language models of different sizes.

<title>AdaSPEC: Selective Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Speculative Decoders</title>

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation (KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters. Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across all tasks (up to 15\%). The code is publicly available at https://github.com/yuezhouhu/adaspec.

Abstract: Using (generative) artificial intelligence tools and systems in journalism is expected to increase journalists' production rates, transform newsrooms' economic models, and further personalize the audience's news consumption practices. Since its release in 2022, OpenAI's ChatGPT and other large language models have raised the alarms inside news organizations, not only for bringing new challenges to news reporting and fact-checking but also for what these technologies would mean for journalists' professional authority in journalism. This paper examines how journalists in Dutch media manage the integration of AI technologies into their daily routines. Drawing from 13 interviews with editors, journalists, and innovation managers in different news outlets and media companies, we propose the concept of controlled change. as a heuristic to explain how journalists are proactively setting guidelines, experimenting with AI tools, and identifying their limitations and capabilities. Using professional authority as a theoretical framework, we argue that journalists anticipate and integrate AI technologies in a supervised manner and identify three primary mechanisms through which journalists manage this integration: (1) developing adaptive guidelines that align AI use with ethical codes, (2) experimenting with AI technologies to determine their necessity and fit, and (3) critically assessing the capabilities and limitations of AI systems.

Abstract: Public and nonprofit organizations often hesitate to adopt AI tools because most models are opaque even though standard approaches typically analyze aggregate patterns rather than offering actionable, case-level guidance. This study tests a practitioner-in-the-loop workflow that pairs transparent decision-tree models with large language models (LLMs) to improve predictive accuracy, interpretability, and the generation of practical insights. Using data from an ongoing college-success program, we build interpretable decision trees to surface key predictors. We then provide each tree's structure to an LLM, enabling it to reproduce case-level predictions grounded in the transparent models. Practitioners participate throughout feature engineering, model design, explanation review, and usability assessment, ensuring that field expertise informs the analysis at every stage. Results show that integrating transparent models, LLMs, and practitioner input yields accurate, trustworthy, and actionable case-level evaluations, offering a viable pathway for responsible AI adoption in the public and nonprofit sectors.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the ''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints, ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative 44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control. Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks, leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling.

Abstract: Preference datasets are essential for incorporating human preferences into pre-trained language models, playing a key role in the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, these datasets often demonstrate conflicting alignment objectives, leading to increased vulnerability to jailbreak attacks and challenges in adapting downstream tasks to prioritize specific alignment objectives without negatively impacting others. In this work, we introduce a novel statistical metric, Alignment Dimension Conflict, to quantify the degree of conflict within preference datasets. We then present \texttt{Hummer} and its fine-grained variant, \texttt{Hummer-F}, as innovative pairwise preference datasets with reduced-conflict alignment objectives. \texttt{Hummer} is built based on UltraFeedback and is enhanced by AI feedback from GPT-4, marking as the first preference dataset aimed at reducing the competition between alignment objectives. Furthermore, we develop reward models, HummerRM and HummerRM-F, which employ a hybrid sampling approach to balance diverse alignment objectives effectively. This sampling method positions HummerRM as an ideal model for domain-specific further fine-tuning and reducing vulnerabilities to attacks.

Abstract: Despite their strengths, large language models (LLMs) often fail to communicate their confidence accurately, making it difficult to assess when they might be wrong and limiting their reliability. In this work, we demonstrate that reasoning models that engage in extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exhibit superior performance not only in problem-solving but also in accurately expressing their confidence. Specifically, we benchmark six reasoning models across six datasets and find that they achieve strictly better confidence calibration than their non-reasoning counterparts in 33 out of the 36 settings. Our detailed analysis reveals that these gains in calibration stem from the slow thinking behaviors of reasoning models (e.g., exploring alternative approaches and backtracking) which enable them to adjust their confidence dynamically throughout their CoT, making it progressively more accurate. In particular, we find that reasoning models become increasingly better calibrated as their CoT unfolds, a trend not observed in non-reasoning models. Moreover, removing slow thinking behaviors from the CoT leads to a significant drop in calibration. Lastly, we show that non-reasoning models also demonstrate enhanced calibration when simply guided to slow think via in-context learning, fully isolating slow thinking as the source of the calibration gains.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel dynamic post-shielding framework that enforces the full class of $\omega$-regular correctness properties over pre-computed probabilistic policies. This constitutes a paradigm shift from the predominant setting of safety-shielding -- i.e., ensuring that nothing bad ever happens -- to a shielding process that additionally enforces liveness -- i.e., ensures that something good eventually happens. At the core, our method uses Strategy-Template-based Adaptive Runtime Shields (STARs), which leverage permissive strategy templates to enable post-shielding with minimal interference. As its main feature, STARs introduce a mechanism to dynamically control interference, allowing a tunable enforcement parameter to balance formal obligations and task-specific behavior at runtime. This allows to trigger more aggressive enforcement when needed, while allowing for optimized policy choices otherwise. In addition, STARs support runtime adaptation to changing specifications or actuator failures, making them especially suited for cyber-physical applications. We evaluate STARs on a mobile robot benchmark to demonstrate their controllable interference when enforcing (incrementally updated) $\omega$-regular correctness properties over learned probabilistic policies.

Abstract: Learning to collaborate with previously unseen partners is a fundamental generalization challenge in multi-agent learning, known as Ad Hoc Teamwork (AHT). Existing AHT approaches often adopt a two-stage pipeline, where first, a fixed population of teammates is generated with the idea that they should be representative of the teammates that will be seen at deployment time, and second, an AHT agent is trained to collaborate well with agents in the population. To date, the research community has focused on designing separate algorithms for each stage. This separation has led to algorithms that generate teammates with limited coverage of possible behaviors, and that ignore whether the generated teammates are easy to learn from for the AHT agent. Furthermore, algorithms for training AHT agents typically treat the set of training teammates as static, thus attempting to generalize to previously unseen partner agents without assuming any control over the set of training teammates. This paper presents a unified framework for AHT by reformulating the problem as an open-ended learning process between an AHT agent and an adversarial teammate generator. We introduce ROTATE, a regret-driven, open-ended training algorithm that alternates between improving the AHT agent and generating teammates that probe its deficiencies. Experiments across diverse two-player environments demonstrate that ROTATE significantly outperforms baselines at generalizing to an unseen set of evaluation teammates, thus establishing a new standard for robust and generalizable teamwork.

Abstract: Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used as assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents, i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.

Abstract: The Endless Tuning is a design method for a reliable deployment of artificial intelligence based on a double mirroring process, which pursues both the goals of avoiding human replacement and filling the so-called responsibility gap (Matthias 2004). Originally depicted in (Fabris et al. 2024) and ensuing the relational approach urged therein, it was then actualized in a protocol, implemented in three prototypical applications regarding decision-making processes (respectively: loan granting, pneumonia diagnosis, and art style recognition) and tested with such as many domain experts. Step by step illustrating the protocol, giving insights concretely showing a different voice (Gilligan 1993) in the ethics of artificial intelligence, a philosophical account of technical choices (e.g., a reversed and hermeneutic deployment of XAI algorithms) will be provided in the present study together with the results of the experiments, focusing on user experience rather than statistical accuracy. Even thoroughly employing deep learning models, full control was perceived by the interviewees in the decision-making setting, while it appeared that a bridge can be built between accountability and liability in case of damage.

Abstract: The injection molding industry faces critical challenges in preserving and transferring field knowledge, particularly as experienced workers retire and multilingual barriers hinder effective communication. This study introduces IM-Chat, a multi-agent framework based on large language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate knowledge transfer in injection molding. IM-Chat integrates both limited documented knowledge (e.g., troubleshooting tables, manuals) and extensive field data modeled through a data-driven process condition generator that infers optimal manufacturing settings from environmental inputs such as temperature and humidity, enabling robust and context-aware task resolution. By adopting a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy and tool-calling agents within a modular architecture, IM-Chat ensures adaptability without the need for fine-tuning. Performance was assessed across 100 single-tool and 60 hybrid tasks for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-3.5-turbo by domain experts using a 10-point rubric focused on relevance and correctness, and was further supplemented by automated evaluation using GPT-4o guided by a domain-adapted instruction prompt. The evaluation results indicate that more capable models tend to achieve higher accuracy, particularly in complex, tool-integrated scenarios. In addition, compared with the fine-tuned single-agent LLM, IM-Chat demonstrated superior accuracy, particularly in quantitative reasoning, and greater scalability in handling multiple information sources. Overall, these findings demonstrate the viability of multi-agent LLM systems for industrial knowledge workflows and establish IM-Chat as a scalable and generalizable approach to AI-assisted decision support in manufacturing.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However, existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability. Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks. Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: We introduce Traffic-R1, a 3B-parameter foundation model with human-like reasoning for Traffic signal control (TSC), developed via self-exploration and iterative reinforcement of LLM with expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three main advantages: zero-shot generalization, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by leveraging internal traffic-control policies and reasoning; a compact 3B-parameter design that supports real-time inference on mobile-class chips for edge deployment; and an explainable TSC process that enables multi-intersection coordination through communication and an asynchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks show Traffic-R1 outperforms strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In production, the model now manages signals affecting over 55,000 drivers daily, reduces average queue lengths by more than 5%, and halves operator workload. Our model is available at https://huggingface.co/Season998/Traffic-R1.

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model (LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought (CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination, yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as intelligent assistants for personalized learning, systematic head-to-head evaluations in authentic learning scenarios remain scarce. This study presents an empirical comparison of three state-of-the-art LLMs on a tutoring task simulating a realistic learning setting. Using a dataset containing a student's responses to ten mixed-format questions with correctness labels, each model was asked to (i) analyze the quiz to identify underlying knowledge components, (ii) infer the student's mastery profile, and (iii) generate targeted guidance for improvement. To mitigate subjectivity and evaluator bias, Gemini was employed as a virtual judge to perform pairwise comparisons across multiple dimensions: accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness. Results analyzed via the Bradley-Terry model reveal that GPT-4o is generally preferred, producing feedback that is more informative and better structured than its counterparts, whereas DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-4.5 demonstrate intermittent strengths but lower consistency. These findings highlight the feasibility of deploying LLMs as advanced teaching assistants for individualized support and provide methodological insights for subsequent empirical research on LLM-driven personalized learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have emphasized the critical role of fine-tuning (FT) techniques in adapting LLMs to specific tasks, especially when retraining from scratch is computationally infeasible. Fine-tuning enables LLMs to leverage task- or domain-specific data, producing models that more effectively meet the requirements of targeted applications. However, conventional FT approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal data efficiency, limiting their real-world applicability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes \textbf{DEAL}, a novel framework that integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with a continuous fine-tuning strategy. By incorporating knowledge retention and adaptive parameter update modules, the framework mitigates the limitations of existing FT methods while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on 15 diverse datasets show that DEAL consistently outperforms baseline methods, yielding substantial gains in task accuracy and resource efficiency. These findings demonstrate the potential of our approach to advance continual adaptation in LLMs by enhancing task performance while improving resource efficiency.

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

Abstract: AI scientists are emerging computational systems that serve as collaborative partners in discovery. These systems remain difficult to build because they are bespoke, tied to rigid workflows, and lack shared environments that unify tools, data, and analyses into a common ecosystem. In genomics, unified ecosystems have transformed research by enabling interoperability, reuse, and community-driven development; AI scientists require comparable infrastructure. We present ToolUniverse, an ecosystem for building AI scientists from any language or reasoning model across open- and closed-weight models. ToolUniverse standardizes how AI scientists identify and call tools by providing more than 600 machine learning models, datasets, APIs, and scientific packages for data analysis, knowledge retrieval, and experimental design. It automatically refines tool interfaces for correct use by AI scientists, generates new tools from natural language descriptions, iteratively optimizes tool specifications, and composes tools into agentic workflows. In a case study of hypercholesterolemia, ToolUniverse was used to create an AI scientist to identify a potent analog of a drug with favorable predicted properties. The open-source ToolUniverse is available at https://aiscientist.tools.

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising 800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline evaluation method.

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health preparedness and response. The source code for the format can be found at https://github.com/OpenSyndrome/schema under the MIT license.

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens. Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained: pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs). Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification -- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks; and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot generalization.

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1, a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework, supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences, followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini, by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the EmbodiedBench benchmark.

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is a powerful paradigm for uncovering the incentive structure that drives agent behavior, by inferring an unknown reward function from observed trajectories within a Markov decision process (MDP). However, most existing IRL methods require access to the transition function, either prescribed or estimated \textit{a priori}, which poses significant challenges when the underlying dynamics are unknown, unobservable, or not easily sampled.
  We propose Fokker--Planck inverse reinforcement learning (FP-IRL), a novel physics-constrained IRL framework tailored for systems governed by Fokker--Planck (FP) dynamics. FP-IRL simultaneously infers both the reward and transition functions directly from trajectory data, without requiring access to sampled transitions. Our method leverages a conjectured equivalence between MDPs and the FP equation, linking reward maximization in MDPs with free energy minimization in FP dynamics. This connection enables inference of the potential function using our inference approach of variational system identification, from which the full set of MDP components -- reward, transition, and policy -- can be recovered using analytic expressions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FP-IRL through experiments on synthetic benchmarks and a modified version of the Mountain Car problem. Our results show that FP-IRL achieves accurate recovery of agent incentives while preserving computational efficiency and physical interpretability.

Abstract: Recommender systems have become an essential component of many online platforms, providing personalized recommendations to users. A crucial aspect is embedding techniques that convert the high-dimensional discrete features, such as user and item IDs, into low-dimensional continuous vectors, which can enhance the recommendation performance. Embedding techniques have revolutionized the capture of complex entity relationships, generating significant research interest. This survey presents a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in recommender system embedding techniques. We examine centralized embedding approaches across matrix, sequential, and graph structures. In matrix-based scenarios, collaborative filtering generates embeddings that effectively model user-item preferences, particularly in sparse data environments. For sequential data, we explore various approaches including recurrent neural networks and self-supervised methods such as contrastive and generative learning. In graph-structured contexts, we analyze techniques like node2vec that leverage network relationships, along with applicable self-supervised methods. Our survey addresses critical scalability challenges in embedding methods and explores innovative directions in recommender systems. We introduce emerging approaches, including AutoML, hashing techniques, and quantization methods, to enhance performance while reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we examine the promising role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in embedding enhancement. Through detailed discussion of various architectures and methodologies, this survey aims to provide a thorough overview of state-of-the-art embedding techniques in recommender systems, while highlighting key challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the conditions under which information about the context of an input $X$ can improve the predictions of deep learning models in new domains. Following work in marginal transfer learning in Domain Generalization (DG), we formalize the notion of context as a permutation-invariant representation of a set of data points that originate from the same domain as the input itself. We offer a theoretical analysis of the conditions under which this approach can, in principle, yield benefits, and formulate two necessary criteria that can be easily verified in practice. Additionally, we contribute insights into the kind of distribution shifts for which the marginal transfer learning approach promises robustness. Empirical analysis shows that our criteria are effective in discerning both favorable and unfavorable scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate that we can reliably detect scenarios where a model is tasked with unwarranted extrapolation in out-of-distribution (OOD) domains, identifying potential failure cases. Consequently, we showcase a method to select between the most predictive and the most robust model, circumventing the well-known trade-off between predictive performance and robustness.

Abstract: Optimizing black-box functions is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. To solve this problem, many approaches learn a surrogate function that estimates the underlying objective from limited historical evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong pattern-matching capabilities via pretraining on vast amounts of data, stand out as a potential candidate for surrogate modeling. However, directly prompting a pretrained language model to produce predictions is not feasible in many scientific domains due to the scarcity of domain-specific data in the pretraining corpora and the challenges of articulating complex problems in natural language. In this work, we introduce LICO, a general-purpose model that extends arbitrary base LLMs for black-box optimization, with a particular application to the molecular domain. To achieve this, we equip the language model with a separate embedding layer and prediction layer, and train the model to perform in-context predictions on a diverse set of functions defined over the domain. Once trained, LICO can generalize to unseen molecule properties simply via in-context prompting. LICO performs competitively on PMO, a challenging molecular optimization benchmark comprising 23 objective functions, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on its low-budget version PMO-1K.

Abstract: Long-term treatment effect estimation is a significant but challenging problem in many applications. Existing methods rely on ideal assumptions, such as no unobserved confounders or binary treatment, to estimate long-term average treatment effects. However, in numerous real-world applications, these assumptions could be violated, and average treatment effects are insufficient for personalized decision-making. In this paper, we address a more general problem of estimating long-term Heterogeneous Dose-Response Curve (HDRC) while accounting for unobserved confounders and continuous treatment. Specifically, to remove the unobserved confounders in the long-term observational data, we introduce an optimal transport weighting framework to align the long-term observational data to an auxiliary short-term experimental data. Furthermore, to accurately predict the heterogeneous effects of continuous treatment, we establish a generalization bound on counterfactual prediction error by leveraging the reweighted distribution induced by optimal transport. Finally, we develop a long-term HDRC estimator building upon the above theoretical foundations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems involving multiple agents are notoriously challenging due to their NP-hard nature and the necessity for effective agent coordination. Despite advancements in learning-based methods, existing approaches often face critical limitations, including suboptimal agent coordination, poor generalization, and high computational latency. To address these issues, we propose PARCO (Parallel AutoRegressive Combinatorial Optimization), a general reinforcement learning framework designed to construct high-quality solutions for multi-agent combinatorial tasks efficiently. To this end, PARCO integrates three key novel components: (1) transformer-based communication layers to enable effective agent collaboration during parallel solution construction, (2) a multiple pointer mechanism for low-latency, parallel agent decision-making, and (3) priority-based conflict handlers to resolve decision conflicts via learned priorities. We evaluate PARCO in multi-agent vehicle routing and scheduling problems, where our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning methods, demonstrating strong generalization ability and remarkable computational efficiency. We make our source code publicly available to foster future research: https://github.com/ai4co/parco.

Abstract: This paper introduces a general method for the exploration of equivalence classes in the input space of Transformer models. The proposed approach is based on sound mathematical theory which describes the internal layers of a Transformer architecture as sequential deformations of the input manifold. Using eigendecomposition of the pullback of the distance metric defined on the output space through the Jacobian of the model, we are able to reconstruct equivalence classes in the input space and navigate across them. Our method enables two complementary exploration procedures: the first retrieves input instances that produce the same class probability distribution as the original instance-thus identifying elements within the same equivalence class-while the second discovers instances that yield a different class probability distribution, effectively navigating toward distinct equivalence classes. Finally, we demonstrate how the retrieved instances can be meaningfully interpreted by projecting their embeddings back into a human-readable format.

Abstract: Previous research has explored the computational expressivity of Transformer models in simulating Boolean circuits or Turing machines. However, the learnability of these simulators from observational data has remained an open question. Our study addresses this gap by providing the first polynomial-time learnability results (specifically strong, agnostic PAC learning) for single-layer Transformers with linear attention. We show that linear attention may be viewed as a linear predictor in a suitably defined RKHS. As a consequence, the problem of learning any linear transformer may be converted into the problem of learning an ordinary linear predictor in an expanded feature space, and any such predictor may be converted back into a multiheaded linear transformer. Moving to generalization, we show how to efficiently identify training datasets for which every empirical risk minimizer is equivalent (up to trivial symmetries) to the linear Transformer that generated the data, thereby guaranteeing the learned model will correctly generalize across all inputs. Finally, we provide examples of computations expressible via linear attention and therefore polynomial-time learnable, including associative memories, finite automata, and a class of Universal Turing Machine (UTMs) with polynomially bounded computation histories. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on three tasks: learning random linear attention networks, key--value associations, and learning to execute finite automata. Our findings bridge a critical gap between theoretical expressivity and learnability of Transformers, and show that flexible and general models of computation are efficiently learnable.

Abstract: Prominent Large Language Model (LLM) services from providers like OpenAI and Google excel at general tasks but often underperform on domain-specific applications. Current customization services for these LLMs typically require users to upload data for fine-tuning, posing significant privacy risks. While differentially private (DP) data synthesis presents a potential alternative, its application commonly results in low effectiveness due to the introduction of excessive noise on data for DP. To overcome this, we introduce Llamdex, a novel framework that facilitates LLM customization as a service, where the client uploads pre-trained domain-specific models rather than data. This client-uploaded model, optionally protected by DP with much lower noise, is inserted into the base LLM via connection modules. Significantly, these connecting modules are trained without requiring sensitive domain data, enabling clients to customize LLM services while preserving data privacy. Experiments demonstrate that Llamdex improves domain-specific accuracy by up to 26% over state-of-the-art private data synthesis methods under identical privacy constraints and, by obviating the need for users to provide domain context within queries, maintains inference efficiency comparable to the original LLM service.

Abstract: We present a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning and algorithmic code synthesis tasks. The benchmark comprises integer sequence generation tasks sourced from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), testing LLMs' abilities to accurately and efficiently generate Python code to compute these sequences without using lookup tables. Our comprehensive evaluation includes leading models from OpenAI (including the specialized reasoning-focused o-series), Anthropic, Meta, and Google across a carefully selected set of 1000 OEIS sequences categorized as ``easy'' or ``hard.'' Half of these sequences are classical sequences from the early days of OEIS and half were recently added to avoid contamination with the models' training data. To prevent models from exploiting memorized sequence values, we introduce an automated cheating detection mechanism that flags usage of lookup tables, validated by comparison with human expert evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that reasoning-specialized models (o3, o3-mini, o4-mini from OpenAI, and Gemini 2.5-pro from Google) achieve substantial improvements in accuracy over non-reasoning models, especially on more complex tasks. However, overall model performance on the hard sequences is poor, highlighting persistent challenges in algorithmic reasoning. Our benchmark provides important insights into the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs, particularly emphasizing the necessity for further advancements to reliably solve complex mathematical reasoning tasks algorithmically.

<title>Fast MRI for All: Bridging Access Gaps by Training without Raw Data</title>

Abstract: Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) approaches have become popular for improved reconstruction of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Though PD-DL offers higher acceleration rates than existing clinical fast MRI techniques, their use has been limited outside specialized MRI centers. A key challenge is generalization to rare pathologies or different populations, noted in multiple studies, with fine-tuning on target populations suggested for improvement. However, current approaches for PD-DL training require access to raw k-space measurements, which is typically only available at specialized MRI centers that have research agreements for such data access. This is especially an issue for rural and under-resourced areas, where commercial MRI scanners only provide access to a final reconstructed image. To tackle these challenges, we propose Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging Fidelity (CUPID) for high-quality PD-DL training using only routine clinical reconstructed images exported from an MRI scanner. CUPID evaluates output quality with a compressibility-based approach while ensuring that the output stays consistent with the clinical parallel imaging reconstruction through well-designed perturbations. Our results show CUPID achieves similar quality to established PD-DL training that requires k-space data while outperforming compressed sensing (CS) and diffusion-based generative methods. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in a zero-shot training setup for retrospectively and prospectively sub-sampled acquisitions, attesting to its minimal training burden. As an approach that radically deviates from existing strategies, CUPID presents an opportunity to provide broader access to fast MRI for remote and rural populations in an attempt to reduce the obstacles associated with this expensive imaging modality.

Abstract: Drone Visual Active Tracking aims to autonomously follow a target object by controlling the motion system based on visual observations, providing a more practical solution for effective tracking in dynamic environments. However, accurate Drone Visual Active Tracking using reinforcement learning remains challenging due to the absence of a unified benchmark and the complexity of open-world environments with frequent interference. To address these issues, we pioneer a systematic solution. First, we propose DAT, the first open-world drone active air-to-ground tracking benchmark. It encompasses 24 city-scale scenes, featuring targets with human-like behaviors and high-fidelity dynamics simulation. DAT also provides a digital twin tool for unlimited scene generation. Additionally, we propose a novel reinforcement learning method called GC-VAT, which aims to improve the performance of drone tracking targets in complex scenarios. Specifically, we design a Goal-Centered Reward to provide precise feedback across viewpoints to the agent, enabling it to expand perception and movement range through unrestricted perspectives. Inspired by curriculum learning, we introduce a Curriculum-Based Training strategy that progressively enhances the tracking performance in complex environments. Besides, experiments on simulator and real-world images demonstrate the superior performance of GC-VAT, achieving a Tracking Success Rate of approximately 72% on the simulator. The benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/SHWplus/DAT_Benchmark.

Abstract: Rolling element bearings are critical components of rotating machinery, with their performance directly influencing the efficiency and reliability of industrial systems. At the same time, bearing faults are a leading cause of machinery failures, often resulting in costly downtime, reduced productivity, and, in extreme cases, catastrophic damage. This study presents a methodology that utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to address these challenges through automatic feature selection, hyperparameter tuning and interpretable fault analysis within a unified framework. By training shallow network architectures and minimizing the number of selected features, the framework produces lightweight models that deliver explainable results through feature attribution and symbolic representations of their activation functions. Validated on two widely recognized datasets for bearing fault diagnosis, the framework achieved perfect F1-Scores for fault detection and high performance in fault and severity classification tasks, including 100% F1-Scores in most cases. Notably, it demonstrated adaptability by handling diverse fault types, such as imbalance and misalignment, within the same dataset. The symbolic representations enhanced model interpretability, while feature attribution offered insights into the optimal feature types or signals for each studied task. These results highlight the framework's potential for practical applications, such as real-time machinery monitoring, and for scientific research requiring efficient and explainable models.

Abstract: Domain-adaptive post-training of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach for specialized domains such as medicine and finance. However, significant challenges remain in identifying optimal adaptation criteria and training strategies across varying data and model configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce FINDAP, a systematic and fine-grained investigation into domain-adaptive post-training of LLMs for the finance domain. Our approach consists of four key components: FinCap, which defines the core capabilities required for the target domain; FinRec, an effective training recipe that jointly optimizes continual pre-training and instruction-following, along with a novel preference data distillation method leveraging process signals from a generative reward model; FinTrain, a curated set of training datasets supporting FinRec; and FinEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite aligned with FinCap. The resulting model, Llama-Fin, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of financial tasks. Our analysis also highlights how each post-training stage contributes to distinct capabilities, uncovering specific challenges and effective solutions, providing valuable insights for domain adaptation of LLMs

Abstract: Diffusion models have established themselves as state-of-the-art generative models across various data modalities, including images and videos, due to their ability to accurately approximate complex data distributions. Unlike traditional generative approaches such as VAEs and GANs, diffusion models employ a progressive denoising process that transforms noise into meaningful data over multiple iterative steps. This gradual approach enhances their expressiveness and generation quality. Not only that, diffusion models have also been shown to extract meaningful representations from data while learning to generate samples. Despite their success, the application of diffusion models to graph-structured data remains relatively unexplored, primarily due to the discrete nature of graphs, which necessitates discrete diffusion processes distinct from the continuous methods used in other domains. In this work, we leverage the representational capabilities of diffusion models to learn meaningful embeddings for graph data. By training a discrete diffusion model within an autoencoder framework, we enable both effective autoencoding and representation learning tailored to the unique characteristics of graph-structured data. We extract the representation from the combination of the encoder's output and the decoder's first time step hidden embedding. Our approach demonstrates the potential of discrete diffusion models to be used for graph representation learning.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in understanding images, videos, and audio beyond text. However, efficiently serving LMMs in production environments poses significant challenges due to their complex architectures and heterogeneous characteristics across their multi-stage inference pipelines. We present the first comprehensive systems analysis of two prominent LMM architectures, decoder-only and cross-attention, across six representative open-source models, revealing key systems design implications. We also present an in-depth analysis of production LMM inference traces, uncovering unique workload characteristics, including variable, heavy-tailed request distributions and bursty traffic patterns. Based on these insights, we propose ModServe, a modular LMM serving system that decouples stages for independent optimization and adaptive scaling. ModServe dynamically reconfigures stages and handles bursty traffic with modality-aware scheduling and autoscaling to meet tail latency SLOs while minimizing costs. ModServe achieves 3.3-5.5x higher throughput (leading to 25-41.3% cost saving) while meeting SLOs on a 128-GPU cluster with production traces.

<title>An Efficient Local Search Approach for Polarized Community Discovery in Signed Networks</title>

arXiv:2502.02197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signed networks, where edges are labeled as positive or negative to represent friendly or antagonistic interactions, provide a natural framework for analyzing polarization, trust, and conflict in social systems. Detecting meaningful group structures in such networks is crucial for understanding online discourse, political divisions, and trust dynamics. A key challenge is to identify communities that are internally cohesive and externally antagonistic, while allowing for neutral or unaligned vertices. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying $k$ polarized communities that addresses a major limitation of prior methods: their tendency to produce highly size-imbalanced solutions. We introduce a novel optimization objective that avoids such imbalance. In addition, it is well known that approximation algorithms based on local search are highly effective for clustering signed networks when neutral vertices are not allowed. We build on this idea and design the first local search algorithm that extends to the setting with neutral vertices while scaling to large networks. By connecting our approach to block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe optimization, we prove a linear convergence rate, enabled by the structure of our objective. Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality, while remaining competitive in computational efficiency.

Abstract: Perceptual constancy is the ability to maintain stable perceptions of objects despite changes in sensory input, such as variations in distance, angle, or lighting. This ability is crucial for visual understanding in a dynamic world. Here, we explored such ability in current Vision Language Models (VLMs). In this study, we evaluated 155 VLMs using 236 experiments across three domains: color, size, and shape constancy. The experiments included single-image and video adaptations of classic cognitive tasks, along with novel tasks in in-the-wild conditions. We found significant variability in VLM performance across these domains, with model performance in shape constancy clearly dissociated from that of color and size constancy.

<title>Towards Enhanced Image Generation Via Multi-modal Chain of Thought in Unified Generative Models</title>

Abstract: Unified generative models have shown remarkable performance in text and image generation. For image synthesis tasks, they adopt straightforward text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, direct T2I generation limits the models in handling complex compositional instructions, which frequently occur in real-world scenarios. Although this issue is vital, existing works mainly focus on improving the basic image generation capability of the models. While such improvements help to some extent, they still fail to adequately resolve the problem. Inspired by Chain of Thought (CoT) solving complex problems step by step, this work aims to introduce CoT into unified generative models to address the challenges of complex image generation that direct T2I generation cannot effectively solve, thereby endowing models with enhanced image generation ability. To achieve this, we first propose Functionality-oriented eXperts (FoXperts), an expert-parallel architecture in our model FoX, which assigns experts by function. FoXperts disentangles potential conflicts in mainstream modality-oriented designs and provides a solid foundation for CoT. When introducing CoT, the first question is how to design it for complex image generation. To this end, we emulate a human-like artistic workflow -- planning, acting, reflection, and correction -- and propose the Multimodal Chain of Thought (MCoT) approach, as the data involves both text and image. To address the subsequent challenge -- designing an effective MCoT training paradigm -- we develop a multi-task joint training scheme that equips the model with all capabilities required for each MCoT step in a disentangled manner. This paradigm avoids the difficulty of collecting consistent multi-step data tuples. Extensive experiments show that FoX consistently outperforms existing unified models on various T2I benchmarks, delivering notable improvements in complex image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit biases toward specific demographic groups, such as generating more males than females when prompted to generate images of engineers, raising ethical concerns and limiting their adoption. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of mitigating generation bias towards any target attribute value (e.g., "male" for "gender") in diffusion models while preserving generation quality. We propose FairGen, an adaptive latent guidance mechanism which controls the generation distribution during inference. In FairGen, a latent guidance module dynamically adjusts the diffusion process to enforce specific attributes, while a memory module tracks the generation statistics and steers latent guidance to align with the targeted fair distribution of the attribute values. Furthermore, we address the limitations of existing datasets by introducing the Holistic Bias Evaluation (HBE) benchmark, which covers diverse domains and incorporates complex prompts to assess bias more comprehensively. Extensive evaluations on HBE and Stable Bias datasets demonstrate that FairGen outperforms existing bias mitigation approaches, achieving substantial bias reduction (e.g., 68.5% gender bias reduction on Stable Diffusion 2). Ablation studies highlight FairGen's ability to flexibly control the output distribution at any user-specified granularity, ensuring adaptive and targeted bias mitigation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enhanced their versatility as they integrate a growing number of modalities. Considering the heavy cost of training MLLMs, it is efficient to reuse the existing ones and extend them to more modalities through Modality-incremental Continual Learning (MCL). The exploration of MCL is in its early stages. In this work, we dive into the causes of performance degradation in MCL. We uncover that it suffers not only from forgetting as in traditional continual learning, but also from misalignment between the modality-agnostic and modality-specific components. To this end, we propose an elegantly simple MCL paradigm called "MErge then ReAlign" (MERA) to address both forgetting and misalignment. MERA avoids introducing heavy model budgets or modifying model architectures, hence is easy to deploy and highly reusable in the MLLM community. Extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive performance of MERA, holding an average of 99.84\% Backward Relative Gain when extending to four modalities, achieving nearly lossless MCL performance. Our findings underscore the misalignment issue in MCL. More broadly, our work showcases how to adjust different components of MLLMs during continual learning.

Abstract: We present EgoBlind, the first egocentric VideoQA dataset collected from blind individuals to evaluate the assistive capabilities of contemporary multimodal large language models (MLLMs). EgoBlind comprises 1,392 first-person videos from the daily lives of blind and visually impaired individuals. It also features 5,311 questions directly posed or verified by the blind to reflect their in-situation needs for visual assistance. Each question has an average of 3 manually annotated reference answers to reduce subjectiveness. Using EgoBlind, we comprehensively evaluate 16 advanced MLLMs and find that all models struggle. The best performers achieve an accuracy near 60\%, which is far behind human performance of 87.4\%. To guide future advancements, we identify and summarize major limitations of existing MLLMs in egocentric visual assistance for the blind and explore heuristic solutions for improvement. With these efforts, we hope that EgoBlind will serve as a foundation for developing effective AI assistants to enhance the independence of the blind and visually impaired. Data and code are available at https://github.com/doc-doc/EgoBlind.

Abstract: Consensus building is inherently challenging due to the diverse opinions held by stakeholders. Effective facilitation is crucial to support the consensus building process and enable efficient group decision making. However, the effectiveness of facilitation is often constrained by human factors such as limited experience and scalability. In this research, we propose a Parallel Thinking-based Facilitation Agent (PTFA) that facilitates online, text-based consensus building processes.The PTFA automatically collects real-time textual input and leverages large language models (LLMs)to perform all six distinct roles of the well-established Six Thinking Hats technique in parallel thinking.To illustrate the potential of the agent, a pilot study was conducted, demonstrating its capabilities in idea generation, emotional probing, and deeper analysis of idea quality. Additionally, future open research challenges such as optimizing scheduling and managing behaviors in divergent phase are identified. Furthermore, a comprehensive dataset that contains not only the conversational content among the participants but also between the participants and the agent is constructed for future study.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research faces a gap between analyzing simple circuits in toy tasks and discovering features in large models. To bridge this gap, we propose text-to-SQL generation as an ideal task to study, as it combines the formal structure of toy tasks with real-world complexity. We introduce TinySQL, a synthetic dataset, progressing from basic to advanced SQL operations, and train models ranging from 33M to 1B parameters to establish a comprehensive testbed for interpretability. We apply multiple complementary interpretability techniques, including Edge Attribution Patching and Sparse Autoencoders, to identify minimal circuits and components supporting SQL generation. We compare circuits for different SQL subskills, evaluating their minimality, reliability, and identifiability. Finally, we conduct a layerwise logit lens analysis to reveal how models compose SQL queries across layers: from intent recognition to schema resolution to structured generation. Our work provides a robust framework for probing and comparing interpretability methods in a structured, progressively complex setting.

Abstract: This paper establishes a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on multi-step geospatial tasks relevant to commercial GIS practitioners. We assess eight commercial LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.5 and 4, Claude Haiku 3.5, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1 and o4-mini) using a simple tool-calling agent equipped with 23 geospatial functions. Our benchmark comprises tasks in four categories of increasing complexity, with both solvable and intentionally unsolvable tasks to test rejection accuracy. We develop a LLM-as-Judge evaluation framework to compare agent solutions against reference solutions. Results show o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieve the best overall performance, OpenAI's GPT-4.1, GPT-4o and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview do not fall far behind, but the last two are more efficient in identifying unsolvable tasks. Claude Sonnet 4, due its preference to provide any solution rather than reject a task, proved to be less accurate. We observe significant differences in token usage, with Anthropic models consuming more tokens than competitors. Common errors include misunderstanding geometrical relationships, relying on outdated knowledge, and inefficient data manipulation. The resulting benchmark set, evaluation framework, and data generation pipeline are released as open-source resources (available at https://github.com/Solirinai/GeoBenchX), providing one more standardized method for the ongoing evaluation of LLMs for GeoAI.

Abstract: This tutorial on adaptation of LLMs is designed to address the growing demand for models that go beyond the static capabilities of generic LLMs by providing an overview of dynamic, domain-specific, and task-adaptive LLM adaptation techniques. While general LLMs have demonstrated strong generalization across a variety of tasks, they often struggle to perform well in specialized domains such as finance, healthcare, and code generation for underrepresented languages. Additionally, their static nature limits their ability to evolve with the changing world, and they are often extremely large in size, making them impractical and costly to deploy at scale. As a result, the adaptation of LLMs has drawn much attention since the birth of LLMs and is of core importance, both for industry, which focuses on serving its targeted users, and academia, which can greatly benefit from small but powerful LLMs. To address this gap, this tutorial aims to provide an overview of the LLM adaptation techniques. We start with an introduction to LLM adaptation, from both the data perspective and the model perspective. We then emphasize how the evaluation metrics and benchmarks are different from other techniques. After establishing the problems, we explore various adaptation techniques. We categorize adaptation techniques into two main families. The first is parametric knowledge adaptation, which focuses on updating the parametric knowledge within LLMs. Additionally, we will discuss real-time adaptation techniques, including model editing, which allows LLMs to be updated dynamically in production environments. The second kind of adaptation is semi-parametric knowledge adaptation, where the goal is to update LLM parameters to better leverage external knowledge or tools through techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based systems.

Abstract: Topic modeling is a key component in unsupervised learning, employed to identify topics within a corpus of textual data. The rapid growth of social media generates an ever-growing volume of textual data daily, making online topic modeling methods essential for managing these data streams that continuously arrive over time. This paper introduces a novel approach to online topic modeling named StreamETM. This approach builds on the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) to handle data streams by merging models learned on consecutive partial document batches using unbalanced optimal transport. Additionally, an online change point detection algorithm is employed to identify shifts in topics over time, enabling the identification of significant changes in the dynamics of text streams. Numerical experiments on simulated and real-world data show StreamETM outperforming competitors. We provide the code publicly available at https://github.com/fgranese/StreamETM.

Abstract: In recent developments, deep learning methodologies applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP) have revealed a paradox: They improve performance but demand considerable data and resources for their training. Alternatively, quantum computing exploits the principles of quantum mechanics to overcome the computational limitations of current methodologies, thereby establishing an emerging field known as quantum natural language processing (QNLP). This domain holds the potential to attain a quantum advantage in the processing of linguistic structures, surpassing classical models in both efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, it is proposed to categorise QNLP models based on quantum computing principles, architecture, and computational approaches. This paper attempts to provide a survey on how quantum meets language by mapping state-of-the-art in this area, embracing quantum encoding techniques for classical data, QNLP models for prevalent NLP tasks, and quantum optimisation techniques for hyper parameter tuning. The landscape of quantum computing approaches applied to various NLP tasks is summarised by showcasing the specific QNLP methods used, and the popularity of these methods is indicated by their count. From the findings, it is observed that QNLP approaches are still limited to small data sets, with only a few models explored extensively, and there is increasing interest in the application of quantum computing to natural language processing tasks.

Abstract: Context lengths for models have grown rapidly, from thousands to millions of tokens in just a few years. The extreme context sizes of modern long-context models have made it difficult to construct realistic long-context benchmarks -- not only due to the cost of collecting million-context tasks but also in identifying realistic scenarios that require significant contexts. We identify code comprehension and repair as a natural testbed and challenge task for long-context models and introduce LongCodeBench (LCB), a benchmark to test LLM coding abilities in long-context scenarios. Our benchmark tests both the comprehension and repair capabilities of LCLMs in realistic and important settings by drawing from real-world GitHub issues and constructing QA (LongCodeQA) and bug fixing (LongSWE-Bench) tasks. We carefully stratify the complexity of our benchmark, enabling us to evaluate models across different scales -- ranging from Qwen2.5 14B Instruct to Google's flagship Gemini model. We find that long-context remains a weakness for all models, with performance drops such as from 29% to 3% for Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or from 70.2% to 40% for Qwen2.5. The LCB dataset is available publicly at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Steefano/LCB and the codebase to replicate the work on this paper at https://github.com/Zteefano/long-code-bench.

<title>Memorization-Compression Cycles Improve Generalization</title>

Abstract: We prove theoretically that generalization improves not only through data scaling but also by compressing internal representations. To operationalize this insight, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Language Modeling (IBLM) objective, which reframes language modeling as a constrained optimization problem: minimizing representation entropy subject to optimal prediction performance. Empirically, we observe an emergent memorization-compression cycle during LLM pretraining, evidenced by oscillation positive/negative gradient alignment between cross-entropy and Matrix-Based Entropy (MBE), a measure of representation entropy. This pattern closely mirrors the predictive-compressive trade-off prescribed by IBLM and also parallels the biological alternation between awake learning and sleep consolidation. Motivated by this observation, we propose Gated Phase Transition (GAPT), a training algorithm that adaptively switches between memorization and compression phases. When applied to GPT-2 pretraining on FineWeb dataset, GAPT reduces MBE by 50% and improves cross-entropy by 4.8%. GAPT improves OOD generalizatino by 35% in a pretraining task on arithmetic multiplication. In a setting designed to simulate catastrophic forgetting, GAPT reduces interference by compressing and separating representations, achieving a 97% improvement in separation - paralleling the functional role of sleep consolidation.

Abstract: Current applications of self-supervised learning to wireless channel representation often borrow paradigms developed for text and image processing, without fully addressing the unique characteristics and constraints of wireless communications. To bridge this gap, we introduce ContraWiMAE, Wireless Contrastive Masked Autoencoder, a transformer-based foundation model that unifies masked reconstruction and masked contrastive learning for wireless channel representation. Our key innovation is a new wireless-inspired contrastive objective that exploits the inherent characteristics of wireless environment, including noise, fading, and partial observability, as natural augmentation. Through extensive evaluation on unseen scenarios and conditions, we demonstrate our method's effectiveness in multiple downstream tasks, including cross-frequency beam selection, line-of-sight detection, and channel estimation. ContraWiMAE exhibits superior linear separability and adaptability in diverse wireless environments, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency and competitive performance compared with supervised baselines under challenging conditions. Comparative evaluations against a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior performance and data efficiency of our approach, highlighting its potential as a powerful baseline for future research in self-supervised wireless channel representation learning. To foster further work in this direction, we release the model weights and training pipeline for ContraWiMAE.

<title>Concept-Guided Interpretability via Neural Chunking</title>

Abstract: Neural networks are often described as black boxes, reflecting the significant challenge of understanding their internal workings and interactions. We propose a different perspective that challenges the prevailing view: rather than being inscrutable, neural networks exhibit patterns in their raw population activity that mirror regularities in the training data. We refer to this as the Reflection Hypothesis and provide evidence for this phenomenon in both simple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and complex large language models (LLMs). Building on this insight, we propose to leverage our cognitive tendency of chunking to segment high-dimensional neural population dynamics into interpretable units that reflect underlying concepts. We propose three methods to extract recurring chunks on a neural population level, complementing each other based on label availability and neural data dimensionality. Discrete sequence chunking (DSC) learns a dictionary of entities in a lower-dimensional neural space; population averaging (PA) extracts recurring entities that correspond to known labels; and unsupervised chunk discovery (UCD) can be used when labels are absent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in extracting concept-encoding entities agnostic to model architectures. These concepts can be both concrete (words), abstract (POS tags), or structural (narrative schema). Additionally, we show that extracted chunks play a causal role in network behavior, as grafting them leads to controlled and predictable changes in the model's behavior. Our work points to a new direction for interpretability, one that harnesses both cognitive principles and the structure of naturalistic data to reveal the hidden computations of complex learning systems, gradually transforming them from black boxes into systems we can begin to understand.

Abstract: Although autoregressive models have dominated language modeling in recent years, there has been a growing interest in exploring alternative paradigms to the conventional next-token prediction framework. Diffusion-based language models have emerged as a compelling alternative due to their powerful parallel generation capabilities and inherent editability. However, these models are often constrained by fixed-length generation. A promising direction is to combine the strengths of both paradigms, segmenting sequences into blocks, modeling autoregressive dependencies across blocks while leveraging discrete diffusion to estimate the conditional distribution within each block given the preceding context. Nevertheless, their practical application is often hindered by two key limitations: rigid fixed-length outputs and a lack of flexible control mechanisms. In this work, we address the critical limitations of fixed granularity and weak controllability in current large diffusion language models. We propose CtrlDiff, a dynamic and controllable semi-autoregressive framework that adaptively determines the size of each generation block based on local semantics using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce a classifier-guided control mechanism tailored to discrete diffusion, which significantly reduces computational overhead while facilitating efficient post-hoc conditioning without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CtrlDiff sets a new standard among hybrid diffusion models, narrows the performance gap to state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches, and enables effective conditional text generation across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Continuous time systems are often modeled using discrete time dynamics but this requires a small simulation step to maintain accuracy. In turn, this requires a large planning horizon which leads to computationally demanding planning problems and reduced performance. Previous work in model-free reinforcement learning has partially addressed this issue using action repeats where a policy is learned to determine a discrete action duration. Instead we propose to control the continuous decision timescale directly by using temporally-extended actions and letting the planner treat the duration of the action as an additional optimization variable along with the standard action variables. This additional structure has multiple advantages. It speeds up simulation time of trajectories and, importantly, it allows for deep horizon search in terms of primitive actions while using a shallow search depth in the planner. In addition, in the model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) setting, it reduces compounding errors from model learning and improves training time for models. We show that this idea is effective and that the range for action durations can be automatically selected using a multi-armed bandit formulation and integrated into the MBRL framework. An extensive experimental evaluation both in planning and in MBRL, shows that our approach yields faster planning, better solutions, and that it enables solutions to problems that are not solved in the standard formulation.

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) ensure interpretability by decomposing predictions into human interpretable concepts. Yet the annotations used for training CBMs that enable this transparency are often noisy, and the impact of such corruption is not well understood. In this study, we present the first systematic study of noise in CBMs and show that even moderate corruption simultaneously impairs prediction performance, interpretability, and the intervention effectiveness. Our analysis identifies a susceptible subset of concepts whose accuracy declines far more than the average gap between noisy and clean supervision and whose corruption accounts for most performance loss. To mitigate this vulnerability we propose a two-stage framework. During training, sharpness-aware minimization stabilizes the learning of noise-sensitive concepts. During inference, where clean labels are unavailable, we rank concepts by predictive entropy and correct only the most uncertain ones, using uncertainty as a proxy for susceptibility. Theoretical analysis and extensive ablations elucidate why sharpness-aware training confers robustness and why uncertainty reliably identifies susceptible concepts, providing a principled basis that preserves both interpretability and resilience in the presence of noise.

<title>Evaluating NLP Embedding Models for Handling Science-Specific Symbolic Expressions in Student Texts</title>

Abstract: In recent years, natural language processing (NLP) has become integral to educational data mining, particularly in the analysis of student-generated language products. For research and assessment purposes, so-called embedding models are typically employed to generate numeric representations of text that capture its semantic content for use in subsequent quantitative analyses. Yet when it comes to science-related language, symbolic expressions such as equations and formulas introduce challenges that current embedding models struggle to address. Existing research studies and practical applications often either overlook these challenges or remove symbolic expressions altogether, potentially leading to biased research findings and diminished performance of practical applications. This study therefore explores how contemporary embedding models differ in their capability to process and interpret science-related symbolic expressions. To this end, various embedding models are evaluated using physics-specific symbolic expressions drawn from authentic student responses, with performance assessed via two approaches: 1) similarity-based analyses and 2) integration into a machine learning pipeline. Our findings reveal significant differences in model performance, with OpenAI's GPT-text-embedding-3-large outperforming all other examined models, though its advantage over other models was moderate rather than decisive. Overall, this study underscores the importance for educational data mining researchers and practitioners of carefully selecting NLP embedding models when working with science-related language products that include symbolic expressions. The code and (partial) data are available at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/6XQVG.

Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a fundamental method for simulating quantum chemical properties, but it remains expensive due to the iterative self-consistent field (SCF) process required to solve the Kohn-Sham equations. Recently, deep learning methods are gaining attention as a way to bypass this step by directly predicting the Hamiltonian. However, they rely on deterministic regression and do not consider the highly structured nature of Hamiltonians. In this work, we propose QHFlow, a high-order equivariant flow matching framework that generates Hamiltonian matrices conditioned on molecular geometry. Flow matching models continuous-time trajectories between simple priors and complex targets, learning the structured distributions over Hamiltonians instead of direct regression. To further incorporate symmetry, we use a neural architecture that predicts SE(3)-equivariant vector fields, improving accuracy and generalization across diverse geometries. To further enhance physical fidelity, we additionally introduce a fine-tuning scheme to align predicted orbital energies with the target. QHFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing Hamiltonian error by 71% on MD17 and 53% on QH9. Moreover, we further show that QHFlow accelerates the DFT process without trading off the solution quality when initializing SCF iterations with the predicted Hamiltonian, significantly reducing the number of iterations and runtime.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI agents have demonstrated their growing potential to drive and support scientific discovery. In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning research. MLR-Bench includes three key components: (1) 201 research tasks sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics; (2) MLR-Judge, an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality; and (3) MLR-Agent, a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation, and paper writing. Our framework supports both stepwise assessment across these distinct research stages, and end-to-end evaluation of the final research paper. We then use MLR-Bench to evaluate six frontier LLMs and an advanced coding agent, finding that while LLMs are effective at generating coherent ideas and well-structured papers, current coding agents frequently (e.g., in 80% of the cases) produce fabricated or invalidated experimental results--posing a major barrier to scientific reliability. We validate MLR-Judge through human evaluation, showing high agreement with expert reviewers, supporting its potential as a scalable tool for research evaluation. We open-source MLR-Bench to help the community benchmark, diagnose, and improve AI research agents toward trustworthy and transparent scientific discovery.

<title>Unlearned but Not Forgotten: Data Extraction after Exact Unlearning in LLM</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models are typically trained on datasets collected from the web, which may inadvertently contain harmful or sensitive personal information. To address growing privacy concerns, unlearning methods have been proposed to remove the influence of specific data from trained models. Of these, exact unlearning -- which retrains the model from scratch without the target data -- is widely regarded the gold standard for mitigating privacy risks in deployment. In this paper, we revisit this assumption in a practical deployment setting where both the pre- and post-unlearning logits API are exposed, such as in open-weight scenarios. Targeting this setting, we introduce a novel data extraction attack that leverages signals from the pre-unlearning model to guide the post-unlearning model, uncovering patterns that reflect the removed data distribution. Combining model guidance with a token filtering strategy, our attack significantly improves extraction success rates -- doubling performance in some cases -- across common benchmarks such as MUSE, TOFU, and WMDP. Furthermore, we demonstrate our attack's effectiveness on a simulated medical diagnosis dataset to highlight real-world privacy risks associated with exact unlearning. In light of our findings, which suggest that unlearning may, in a contradictory way, increase the risk of privacy leakage during real-world deployments, we advocate for evaluation of unlearning methods to consider broader threat models that account not only for post-unlearning models but also for adversarial access to prior checkpoints.

Abstract: Previous research has investigated the application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding 3D scenes by interpreting them as videos. These approaches generally depend on comprehensive 3D data inputs, such as point clouds or reconstructed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps. In our research, we advance this field by enhancing the capability of MLLMs to understand and reason in 3D spaces directly from video data, without the need for additional 3D input. We propose a novel and efficient method called the Video-3D Geometry Large Language Model (VG LLM). Our approach utilizes a 3D visual geometry encoder to extract 3D prior information from video sequences. This information is then integrated with visual tokens and input into the MLLM. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has achieved substantial improvements in various tasks related to 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning, all directly learned from video sources. Impressively, our 4B model, which does not rely on explicit 3D data inputs, achieves competitive results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and even surpasses the Gemini-1.5-Pro in the VSI-Bench evaluations.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making routinely demands reasoning over heterogeneous data, yet existing multimodal language models (MLLMs) remain largely vision-centric and fail to generalize across clinical specialties. To bridge this gap, we introduce QoQ-Med-7B/32B, the first open generalist clinical foundation model that jointly reasons across medical images, time-series signals, and text reports. QoQ-Med is trained with Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization (DRPO), a novel reinforcement-learning objective that hierarchically scales normalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty, mitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions. Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains, we show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro-F1 on average across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training methods like GRPO. Furthermore, with QoQ-Med trained on intensive segmentation data, it is able to highlight salient regions related to the diagnosis, with an IoU 10x higher than open models while reaching the performance of OpenAI o4-mini. To foster reproducibility and downstream research, we release (i) the full model weights, (ii) the modular training pipeline, and (iii) all intermediate reasoning traces at https://github.com/DDVD233/QoQ_Med.

Abstract: In this work, we study the scalability of offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. In principle, a truly scalable offline RL algorithm should be able to solve any given problem, regardless of its complexity, given sufficient data, compute, and model capacity. We investigate if and how current offline RL algorithms match up to this promise on diverse, challenging, previously unsolved tasks, using datasets up to 1000x larger than typical offline RL datasets. We observe that despite scaling up data, many existing offline RL algorithms exhibit poor scaling behavior, saturating well below the maximum performance. We hypothesize that the horizon is the main cause behind the poor scaling of offline RL. We empirically verify this hypothesis through several analysis experiments, showing that long horizons indeed present a fundamental barrier to scaling up offline RL. We then show that various horizon reduction techniques substantially enhance scalability on challenging tasks. Based on our insights, we also introduce a minimal yet scalable method named SHARSA that effectively reduces the horizon. SHARSA achieves the best asymptotic performance and scaling behavior among our evaluation methods, showing that explicitly reducing the horizon unlocks the scalability of offline RL.

Abstract: Synthetic time series generated by diffusion models enable sharing privacy-sensitive datasets, such as patients' functional MRI records. Key criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous latent spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in data space, making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the challenge of watermarking directly in data space while handling feature heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark directly within the temporal-feature data space. The other unique feature is the $\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction error distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time series while preserving robust watermark detectability. We extensively evaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark detectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against five datasets and baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that TimeWak achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in correlational scores against the strongest state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining consistently detectable.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models is becoming increasingly important due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns. However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To address this problem, we propose GUARD, a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the alignment between the Forget and Retain sets while remaining computationally efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended retention loss. We also provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly improves retention while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive experiments on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the TOFU Retain Set by up to 194.92 percent in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10 percent of the training data, and improves knowledge retention on the MUSE NEWS Retain Set by 16.20 percent, with comparable or very moderate increases in privacy loss compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are a new class of text generators that offer advantages such as bidirectional context use, parallelizable generation, and flexible prompting compared to autoregressive models. However, a critical limitation of discrete diffusion models is their inability to perform flexible-length or flexible-position text infilling without access to ground-truth positional data. We introduce \textbf{DDOT} (\textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport Position Coupling), the first discrete diffusion model to overcome this challenge. DDOT jointly denoises token values and token positions, employing a novel sample-level Optimal Transport (OT) coupling. This coupling preserves relative token ordering while dynamically adjusting the positions and length of infilled segments, a capability previously missing in text diffusion. Our method is orthogonal to existing discrete text diffusion methods and is compatible with various pretrained text denoisers. Extensive experiments on text infilling benchmarks such as One-Billion-Word and Yelp demonstrate that DDOT outperforms naive diffusion baselines. Furthermore, DDOT achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models and enables significant improvements in training efficiency and flexibility.

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution (Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence, resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at https://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.

Abstract: Efficiently identifying the right trajectories for training remains an open problem in GFlowNets. To address this, it is essential to prioritize exploration in regions of the state space where the reward distribution has not been sufficiently learned. This calls for uncertainty-driven exploration, in other words, the agent should be aware of what it does not know. This attribute can be measured by joint predictions, which are particularly important for combinatorial and sequential decision problems. In this research, we integrate epistemic neural networks (ENN) with the conventional architecture of GFlowNets to enable more efficient joint predictions and better uncertainty quantification, thereby improving exploration and the identification of optimal trajectories. Our proposed algorithm, ENN-GFN-Enhanced, is compared to the baseline method in GFlownets and evaluated in grid environments and structured sequence generation in various settings, demonstrating both its efficacy and efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks requiring multimodal alignment, including zero-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than $1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally, we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for resource-constrained domains.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance, controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using three DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different model architectures.

Abstract: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is known to be resource-intensive, both in terms of memory and computational cost. To mitigate this, a common approach is to restrict training to a subset of the model parameters. By analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning settings than in training from scratch. Motivated by this observation, we propose NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights during finetuning and offers several practical advantages: first, this criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance in experiments. We demonstrate this for both NLP and vision tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, unlearning techniques, which are methods for inducing a model to "forget" previously learned information, have attracted attention as a way to address privacy and copyright concerns in large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs). While several unlearning benchmarks have been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii) Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same data are split and unlearned sequentially.

Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality, multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818 interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories, consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The dataset and source code of PRING are available at https://github.com/SophieSarceau/PRING.

<title>On the Effectiveness of Methods and Metrics for Explainable AI in Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification</title>

Abstract: The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories (faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP, and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast, robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings. Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods, metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i) simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data (unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling (instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off, (iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models, yields best calibration results overall.

Abstract: Embodied agents face persistent challenges in real-world environments, including partial observability, limited spatial reasoning, and high-latency multi-memory integration. We present RoboMemory, a brain-inspired framework that unifies Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic memory under a parallelized architecture for efficient long-horizon planning and interactive environmental learning. A dynamic spatial knowledge graph (KG) ensures scalable and consistent memory updates, while a closed-loop planner with a critic module supports adaptive decision-making in dynamic settings. Experiments on EmbodiedBench show that RoboMemory, built on Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins, improves average success rates by 25% over its baseline and exceeds the closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) Gemini-1.5-Pro by 3%. Real-world trials further confirm its capacity for cumulative learning, with performance improving across repeated tasks. These results highlight RoboMemory as a scalable foundation for memory-augmented embodied intelligence, bridging the gap between cognitive neuroscience and robotic autonomy.

<title>Explaining Time Series Classifiers with PHAR: Rule Extraction and Fusion from Post-hoc Attributions</title>

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc Attribution Rules - a unified framework that transforms numeric feature attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into structured, human-readable rules. These rules define human-readable intervals that indicate where and when decision-relevant segments occur and can enhance model transparency by localizing threshold-based conditions on the raw series. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations - a common effect of the Rashomon phenomenon - into coherent, domain-adaptable insights. Comprehensive experiments on UCR/UEA Time Series Classification Archive demonstrate that PHAR may improve interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS classification tasks by providing concise, human-readable rules aligned with model predictions.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in Text-to-Audio Generation (TTA), providing sound creators with powerful tools to transform inspirations into vivid audio. Yet despite these advances, current TTA systems often suffer from slow inference speed, which greatly hinders the efficiency and smoothness of audio creation. In this paper, we present MeanAudio, a fast and faithful text-to-audio generator capable of rendering realistic sound with only one function evaluation (1-NFE). MeanAudio leverages: (i) the MeanFlow objective with guided velocity target that significantly accelerates inference speed, (ii) an enhanced Flux-style transformer with dual text encoders for better semantic alignment and synthesis quality, and (iii) an efficient instantaneous-to-mean curriculum that speeds up convergence and enables training on consumer-grade GPUs. Through a comprehensive evaluation study, we demonstrate that MeanAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-step audio generation. Specifically, it achieves a real-time factor (RTF) of 0.013 on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090, yielding a 100x speedup over SOTA diffusion-based TTA systems. Moreover, MeanAudio also shows strong performance in multi-step generation, enabling smooth transitions across successive synthesis steps.

<title>Who's Asking? Investigating Bias Through the Lens of Disability Framed Queries in LLMs</title>

arXiv:2508.15831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters. Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our Middo consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Word2VecT/Middo.

Abstract: Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6 synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>Training-Free Label Space Alignment for Universal Domain Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where label spaces may differ and the target domain may contain private classes. Previous UniDA methods primarily focused on visual space alignment but often struggled with visual ambiguities due to content differences, which limited their robustness and generalizability. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the strong \textit{zero-shot capabilities} of recent vision-language foundation models (VLMs) like CLIP, concentrating solely on label space alignment to enhance adaptation stability. CLIP can generate task-specific classifiers based only on label names. However, adapting CLIP to UniDA is challenging because the label space is not fully known in advance. In this study, we first utilize generative vision-language models to identify unknown categories in the target domain. Noise and semantic ambiguities in the discovered labels -- such as those similar to source labels (e.g., synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms) -- complicate label alignment. To address this, we propose a training-free label-space alignment method for UniDA (\ours). Our method aligns label spaces instead of visual spaces by filtering and refining noisy labels between the domains. We then construct a \textit{universal classifier} that integrates both shared knowledge and target-private class information, thereby improving generalizability under domain shifts. The results reveal that the proposed method considerably outperforms existing UniDA techniques across key DomainBed benchmarks, delivering an average improvement of \textcolor{blue}{+7.9\%}in H-score and \textcolor{blue}{+6.1\%} in H$^3$-score. Furthermore, incorporating self-training further enhances performance and achieves an additional (\textcolor{blue}{+1.6\%}) increment in both H- and H$^3$-scores.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) safely in the real world is challenging, as policies trained in simulators must face the inevitable sim-to-real gap. Robust safe RL techniques are provably safe, however difficult to scale, while domain randomization is more practical yet prone to unsafe behaviors. We address this gap by proposing SPiDR, short for Sim-to-real via Pessimistic Domain Randomization -- a scalable algorithm with provable guarantees for safe sim-to-real transfer. SPiDR uses domain randomization to incorporate the uncertainty about the sim-to-real gap into the safety constraints, making it versatile and highly compatible with existing training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on sim-to-sim benchmarks and two distinct real-world robotic platforms, we demonstrate that SPiDR effectively ensures safety despite the sim-to-real gap while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: We study weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ), which quantizes the weights of a large language model (LLM) without retraining, using little or no calibration data. Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint and latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference scenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its importance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs complicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that transform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with fewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first derive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized weights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit quantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to achieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical insight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile collection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded quantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar quantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with optimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging Q-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme quantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion decisions given resource constraints. The code is available at https://github.com/snu-mllab/Q-Palette.

Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable decision paths.

<title>ALHD: A Large-Scale and Multigenre Benchmark Dataset for Arabic LLM-Generated Text Detection</title>

Abstract: We introduce ALHD, the first large-scale comprehensive Arabic dataset explicitly designed to distinguish between human- and LLM-generated texts. ALHD spans three genres (news, social media, reviews), covering both MSA and dialectal Arabic, and contains over 400K balanced samples generated by three leading LLMs and originated from multiple human sources, which enables studying generalizability in Arabic LLM-genearted text detection. We provide rigorous preprocessing, rich annotations, and standardized balanced splits to support reproducibility. In addition, we present, analyze and discuss benchmark experiments using our new dataset, in turn identifying gaps and proposing future research directions. Benchmarking across traditional classifiers, BERT-based models, and LLMs (zero-shot and few-shot) demonstrates that fine-tuned BERT models achieve competitive performance, outperforming LLM-based models. Results are however not always consistent, as we observe challenges when generalizing across genres; indeed, models struggle to generalize when they need to deal with unseen patterns in cross-genre settings, and these challenges are particularly prominent when dealing with news articles, where LLM-generated texts resemble human texts in style, which opens up avenues for future research. ALHD establishes a foundation for research related to Arabic LLM-detection and mitigating risks of misinformation, academic dishonesty, and cyber threats.

<title>Improving Metacognition and Uncertainty Communication in Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making contexts, but when they present answers without signaling low confidence, users may unknowingly act on erroneous outputs. Prior work shows that LLMs maintain internal uncertainty signals, yet their expressed confidence is often miscalibrated and poorly discriminates between correct and incorrect answers. We investigate whether supervised fine-tuning can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We fine-tune LLMs on datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation, where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more likely to answer correctly. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including medical and legal reasoning. Results show that fine-tuning improves calibration (alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains. However, gains are task-specific: training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise comparison, and vice versa. Multitask fine-tuning yields broader gains, lowering calibration error and strengthening discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations. This suggests that uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable but requires multitask training to generalize effectively.

Abstract: Predicting precipitation maps is a highly complex spatiotemporal modeling task, critical for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. Short-term precipitation forecasting, or nowcasting, requires models that are not only accurate but also computationally efficient for real-time applications. Current methods, such as token-based autoregressive models, often suffer from flawed inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models can be computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce BlockGPT, a generative autoregressive transformer using batched tokenization (Block) method that predicts full two-dimensional fields (frames) at each time step. Conceived as a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction, BlockGPT factorizes space-time by using self-attention within each frame and causal attention across frames; in this work, we instantiate it for precipitation nowcasting. We evaluate BlockGPT on two precipitation datasets, viz. KNMI (Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including token-based (NowcastingGPT) and diffusion-based (DiffCast+Phydnet) models. The results show that BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy, event localization as measured by categorical metrics, and inference speeds up to 31x faster than comparable baselines.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism. While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity. Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference pipeline into four modular components--model, diffusion iteration manager, decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager--and integrates novel algorithms for each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800 tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to prior systems, dInfer delivers a $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while maintaining similar model performance. Even compared to the AR model (with a comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which is highly optimized with the latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still delivers a $2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.

Abstract: Achieving mission objectives in a realistic simulation of aerial combat is highly challenging due to imperfect situational awareness and nonlinear flight dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D multi-agent air combat environment and a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework to tackle these challenges. Our approach combines heterogeneous agent dynamics, curriculum learning, league-play, and a newly adapted training algorithm. To this end, the decision-making process is organized into two abstraction levels: low-level policies learn precise control maneuvers, while high-level policies issue tactical commands based on mission objectives. Empirical results show that our hierarchical approach improves both learning efficiency and combat performance in complex dogfight scenarios.

Abstract: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman & Karbasi, arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology is by no means complete or exact. It was nonetheless able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close about a third of the sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences, 2025].

Abstract: The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert interpretability.

Abstract: Rapid electrification and decarbonization are increasing the complexity of distribution grid (DG) operation and planning, necessitating advanced computational analyses to ensure reliability and resilience. These analyses depend on disparate workflows comprising complex models, function calls, and data pipelines that require substantial expert knowledge and remain difficult to automate. Workforce and budget constraints further limit utilities' ability to apply such analyses at scale. To address this gap, we build an agentic system PowerChain, which is capable of autonomously performing complex grid analyses. Existing agentic AI systems are typically developed in a bottom-up manner with customized context for predefined analysis tasks; therefore, they do not generalize to tasks that the agent has never seen. In comparison, to generalize to unseen DG analysis tasks, PowerChain dynamically generates structured context by leveraging supervisory signals from self-contained power systems tools (e.g., GridLAB-D) and an optimized set of expert-annotated and verified reasoning trajectories. For complex DG tasks defined in natural language, empirical results on real utility data demonstrate that PowerChain achieves up to a 144/% improvement in performance over baselines.

<br />Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in interactive web applications but are susceptible to misuse and harm, particularly in the context of online harassment. This study introduces the Online Harassment Agentic Benchmark, including a synthetic dataset, multi-agent simulation, and jailbreak methods targeting memory, planning, and fine-tuning in two prominent LLMs. Results show that jailbreak tuning significantly increases the success rate of harassment attacks, with prevalent toxic behaviors like Insult and Flaming. Attacked agents exhibit human-like aggression profiles, highlighting the need for robust safety measures. Closed-source models show higher vulnerability to attacks than open-source models. These findings underscore the importance of developing safety guardrails to ensure the responsible use of LLMs in online platforms. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim) simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama, and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with 84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs. 31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

Summary:
This study explores the scalability of LLM-based agents through self-learning without human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. The research identifies the importance of reward signals from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) over rigid rule-based signals and emphasizes the significance of increasing the volume of agent task data for improved performance. The proposed framework, Agentic Self-Learning (ASL), integrates a Prompt Generator, Policy Model, and GRM to create a closed-loop reinforcement learning environment that enhances task setting, verification, and problem-solving abilities. ASL outperforms RLVR baselines and demonstrates superior sample efficiency and robustness under zero-labeled-data conditions. The study highlights the critical role of continual GRM training in overcoming reward hacking and achieving optimal performance, ultimately showcasing the effectiveness of multi-role co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator, a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically, ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines (e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling. This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents.

Summary:
Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) but faces a bias towards exploitation over exploration. The training dynamics of RLVR methods show a concentration effect where the probability of the top candidate increases, leading to reduced performance for K>1. To address this issue, Simple Pass@K Optimization (SimKO) is introduced, which adjusts probabilities asymmetrically to encourage exploration. For correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the top-K candidates, while for incorrect responses, it penalizes the top-1 candidate. SimKO effectively mitigates over-concentration, especially in tokens with high entropy. Across various benchmarks, SimKO consistently improves pass@K performance, offering a straightforward solution to enhance exploration in RLVR systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1 candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way to improve RLVR's exploration.

Summary:<br />
The article proposes a GPU native bilinear operator, Strassen-Tile (STL), as an alternative to huge matrix multiplications (MatMuls) in neural networks. STL offers a tradeoff between speed, accuracy, and parameter count by utilizing a local learnable change-of-basis on tiles of weight and activation matrices. The optimization of the change-of-basis in STL is a non-convex problem, but theory-backed initializations lead to improved accuracy. Experimental results show that STL can approximate 4x4 MatMul of tiles while reducing FLOPs by 2.66 times. Furthermore, STL can enhance the accuracy of Imagenet-1K models like T2T-ViT-7 with fewer FLOPs. Despite non-optimized code, STL achieves speedups in the compute-bound regime. These findings highlight STL as a promising building block for scalable and cost-efficient AI.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Modern AI relies on huge matrix multiplications (MatMuls), whose computation poses a scalability problem for inference and training. We propose an alternative, GPU native bilinear operator to MatMuls in neural networks, which offers a three-way tradeoff between: speed, accuracy and parameter count. In particular, this operator requires substantially fewer FLOPs to evaluate ($\ll n^3$), yet increases the parameter count compared to MatMul ($\gg n^2$). We call this operator Strassen-Tile (STL). The key idea behind STL is a local learnable change-of-basis, applied on tiles of the weight and activation matrices, followed by an element-wise product between the tiles, implemented simultaneously via MatMul. The key technical question we study is how to optimize the change-of-basis of a given layer, which is a highly non-convex problem. We show that theory-backed initializations (inspired by fast matrix and polynomial multiplication) lead to substantially better accuracy than random SGD initialization. This phenomenon motivates further algorithmic study of STL optimization in DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate that STL can approximate 4x4 MatMul of tiles while reducing FLOPs by a factor of 2.66, and can improve Imagenet-1K accuracy of SoTA T2T-ViT-7 (4.3M parameters) while lowering FLOPs. Even with non-CUDA optimized PyTorch code, STL achieves wall-clock speedups in the compute-bound regime. These results, together with its theoretical grounds, suggest STL as a promising building block for scalable and cost-efficient AI.

Summary:<br />
Tract2Shape is a novel deep learning framework that predicts white matter tractography shape measures using geometric and scalar features. It outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy and efficiency, particularly benefiting from its multimodal input and dimensionality reduction techniques. The model achieves high performance on both the HCP-YA and PPMI datasets, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation. Tract2Shape facilitates fast, accurate, and scalable analysis of white matter shape measures, paving the way for future large-scale studies in this area. <div>
arXiv:2504.18400v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shape measures have emerged as promising descriptors of white matter tractography, offering complementary insights into anatomical variability and associations with cognitive and clinical phenotypes. However, conventional methods for computing shape measures are computationally expensive and time-consuming for large-scale datasets due to reliance on voxel-based representations. We propose Tract2Shape, a novel multimodal deep learning framework that leverages geometric (point cloud) and scalar (tabular) features to predict ten white matter tractography shape measures. To enhance model efficiency, we utilize a dimensionality reduction algorithm for the model to predict five primary shape components. The model is trained and evaluated on two independently acquired datasets, the HCP-YA dataset, and the PPMI dataset. We evaluate the performance of Tract2Shape by training and testing it on the HCP-YA dataset and comparing the results with state-of-the-art models. To further assess its robustness and generalization ability, we also test Tract2Shape on the unseen PPMI dataset. Tract2Shape outperforms SOTA deep learning models across all ten shape measures, achieving the highest average Pearson's r and the lowest nMSE on the HCP-YA dataset. The ablation study shows that both multimodal input and PCA contribute to performance gains. On the unseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's r and low nMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation. Tract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white matter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis across datasets.

<div> Keywords: Finetuning, Language models, Interpretability, DIT-adapter, Natural language descriptions

Summary: 
Finetuning language models is a common practice to update their knowledge for new tasks. However, the changes in model weights after finetuning are often difficult to interpret. The lack of accessibility to finetuning datasets makes it challenging to understand how the model has evolved. To address this, Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT) is introduced, a method that trains models to explain their own modifications post-finetuning using synthetic, labeled weight diffs. By training a DIT-adapter with these weight diffs, models can effectively describe their finetuning-induced changes in natural language. In two proof-of-concept scenarios where hidden behaviors and finetuned knowledge need to be reported and summarized, DIT enables models to provide accurate descriptions of their modifications. This approach enhances the interpretability of finetuned language models and helps in comprehensively understanding how they evolve.

Abstract: Finetuning (pretrained) language models is a standard approach for updating their internal parametric knowledge and specializing them to new tasks and domains. However, the corresponding model weight changes ("weight diffs") are not generally interpretable. While inspecting the finetuning dataset can give a sense of how the model might have changed, these datasets are often not publicly available or are too large to work with directly. Towards the goal of comprehensively understanding weight diffs in natural language, we introduce Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT), a method that trains models to describe their own finetuning-induced modifications. Our approach uses synthetic, labeled weight diffs to train a DIT-adapter, which can be applied to a compatible finetuned model to make it describe how it has changed. We demonstrate in two proof-of-concept settings (reporting hidden behaviors and summarizing finetuned knowledge) that our method enables models to describe their finetuning-induced modifications using accurate natural language descriptions.

<div> Keywords: Deep Edge Filter, high-pass filtering, deep neural networks, generalizability, feature sparsification

Summary: 
The article introduces the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach aimed at enhancing model generalizability by applying high-pass filtering to deep neural network features. The method operates on the premise that task-relevant semantic data is encoded in high-frequency components, while domain-specific biases are stored in low-frequency components within deep features. By subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, the approach effectively isolates generalizable representations while preserving the network's architectural integrity. Experimental results across various domains like Vision, Text, 3D, and Audio show consistent performance improvements, regardless of model architecture and data modality. Analysis of the method reveals that it induces feature sparsification and successfully isolates high-frequency components, validating the underlying hypothesis. The code for the Deep Edge Filter is available on GitHub for reference and implementation.

<div> Hierarchical Semantic Alignment, Cooperative Completion, Multi-view clustering, Deep learning, Incomplete data <br />
Summary: <br />
This paper presents a novel framework, HSACC, for incomplete multi-view clustering, addressing challenges posed by missing views. HSACC utilizes a dual-level semantic space approach for robust cross-view fusion. In the low-level semantic space, mutual information maximization ensures consistency alignment across views. Adaptive view weights are dynamically assigned in the high-level semantic space based on distributional affinity for weighted fusion and global representation generation. Additionally, HSACC implicitly recovers missing views through projection into high-dimensional semantic spaces, enabling cooperative learning of completion and clustering objectives. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate HSACC outperforms existing methods. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of hierarchical alignment and dynamic weighting, while parameter analysis showcases the model's robustness to hyperparameters. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data, where certain views are entirely missing for some samples, poses significant challenges for traditional multi-view clustering methods. Existing deep incomplete multi-view clustering approaches often rely on static fusion strategies or two-stage pipelines, leading to suboptimal fusion results and error propagation issues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel incomplete multi-view clustering framework based on Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion (HSACC). HSACC achieves robust cross-view fusion through a dual-level semantic space design. In the low-level semantic space, consistency alignment is ensured by maximizing mutual information across views. In the high-level semantic space, adaptive view weights are dynamically assigned based on the distributional affinity between individual views and an initial fused representation, followed by weighted fusion to generate a unified global representation. Additionally, HSACC implicitly recovers missing views by projecting aligned latent representations into high-dimensional semantic spaces and jointly optimizes reconstruction and clustering objectives, enabling cooperative learning of completion and clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that HSACC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the hierarchical alignment and dynamic weighting mechanisms, while parameter analysis confirms the model's robustness to hyperparameter variations.

<div> Keywords: AI debate, large language models, prior beliefs, persuasion dynamics, human-AI interaction

Summary:<br /><br />AI debate experiments were conducted to assess large language models' behavior when faced with conflicting judge personas. Models tended to align with the judge's perspective for maximum persuasiveness, rather than sticking to their prior beliefs. Sequential debate introduced bias favoring the second debater, highlighting potential flaws in the process. Models were found to be more persuasive when defending positions consistent with their prior beliefs. Surprisingly, arguments against prior beliefs were rated higher in quality in pairwise comparisons. These results provide insights for human judges to offer better training signals and contribute to the development of more aligned AI systems. Additionally, the study sheds light on the dynamics of persuasion in language models and human-AI interaction, emphasizing the complexities in decision-making and belief systems within AI systems. <div>
arXiv:2510.13912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically, arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in language models.

Summary: 
In this paper, the authors discuss the limitations of current static and task-specific benchmarks in multi-agent simulations and argue for a rethinking of these approaches. They highlight the potential of leveraging large language models (llm) to enable agents to evolve, adapt, and reshape their environments in unpredictable ways. The authors review emerging architectures that combine llm with multi-agent dynamics and address challenges such as balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling to greater complexity. They introduce a taxonomy for this evolving field and propose a research roadmap focused on open-endedness, continuous co-evolution, and the development of socially aligned AI ecosystems. The authors call on the research community to move beyond static paradigms and collaborate in shaping the future of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent simulations.

Abstract: What if artificial agents could not just communicate, but also evolve, adapt, and reshape their worlds in ways we cannot fully predict? With llm now powering multi-agent systems and social simulations, we are witnessing new possibilities for modeling open-ended, ever-changing environments. Yet, most current simulations remain constrained within static sandboxes, characterized by predefined tasks, limited dynamics, and rigid evaluation criteria. These limitations prevent them from capturing the complexity of real-world societies. In this paper, we argue that static, task-specific benchmarks are fundamentally inadequate and must be rethought. We critically review emerging architectures that blend llm with multi-agent dynamics, highlight key hurdles such as balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling to greater complexity, and introduce a fresh taxonomy for this rapidly evolving field. Finally, we present a research roadmap centered on open-endedness, continuous co-evolution, and the development of resilient, socially aligned AI ecosystems. We call on the community to move beyond static paradigms and help shape the next generation of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent simulations.

Summary: 
The article introduces FinAI Data Assistant, a system for natural-language querying over financial databases that combines large language models with the OpenAI Function Calling API. Instead of using text-to-SQL to generate complete SQL queries, the system routes user requests to predefined queries for efficiency and reliability. The study investigates the capability of large language models to recall time-dependent financial data, accuracy in mapping company names to stock ticker symbols, and the effectiveness of function calling compared to text-to-SQL for database queries. Results show that large language models have errors in predicting financial data and exhibit bias in stock prices, but achieve high accuracy in mapping company names to stock ticker symbols. FinAI Data Assistant outperforms text-to-SQL in terms of latency, cost, and reliability. The article discusses design trade-offs, limitations, and potential deployment opportunities.

arXiv:2510.14162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FinAI Data Assistant, a practical approach for natural-language querying over financial databases that combines large language models (LLMs) with the OpenAI Function Calling API. Rather than synthesizing complete SQL via text-to-SQL, our system routes user requests to a small library of vetted, parameterized queries, trading generative flexibility for reliability, low latency, and cost efficiency. We empirically study three questions: (RQ1) whether LLMs alone can reliably recall or extrapolate time-dependent financial data without external retrieval; (RQ2) how well LLMs map company names to stock ticker symbols; and (RQ3) whether function calling outperforms text-to-SQL for end-to-end database query processing. Across controlled experiments on prices and fundamentals, LLM-only predictions exhibit non-negligible error and show look-ahead bias primarily for stock prices relative to model knowledge cutoffs. Ticker-mapping accuracy is near-perfect for NASDAQ-100 constituents and high for S\&amp;P~500 firms. Finally, FinAI Data Assistant achieves lower latency and cost and higher reliability than a text-to-SQL baseline on our task suite. We discuss design trade-offs, limitations, and avenues for deployment.

<div> Reinforcement Learning, Safety, Probabilistic Shielding, Risk Augmentation, Model-Free <br />
Summary: Safety is paramount in reinforcement learning (RL), where optimal performance must be coupled with formal safety guarantees for deployment. The Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh) algorithm addresses this by introducing a model-free approach for safe RL under cost constraints. ProSh enhances the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and utilizes a cost critic to shield the agent's policy distribution, ensuring that all actions taken are safe on average. ProSh maintains optimality in deterministic environments and offers a tight upper-bound on expected cost during training, dependent on critic accuracy. Even with limited environment knowledge, ProSh guarantees safety during training under reasonable assumptions, validated in experiments. <div>

Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation. We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown in the experiments.

<div> LoRA, Large Language Model, Cartridge Activation Space Transfer, transfer learning, model interoperability <br />
<br />Summary: The article discusses the challenge of architectural lock-in in Large Language Model (LLM) architectures and introduces a new framework called Cartridge Activation Space Transfer (CAST) to address this issue. CAST leverages activation manifolds to directly transfer valuable task-specific behaviors encoded through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) between different LLM architectures. By learning a nonlinear mapping between activation streams and applying a pre-trained LoRA as a "behavioral kernel," CAST enables zero-shot translation of LoRA adapters, achieving high performance in model interoperability. The framework outperforms existing weight-space transfer methods and establishes a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability. <div>
arXiv:2510.17902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) architectures presents a fundamental challenge: valuable, task-specific behaviors learned through fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are effectively trapped within their source model's architecture, herein referred to architectural lock-in. Existing transfer methods attempt to bridge this gap by aligning the static weight spaces of models, a brittle and indirect approach that relies on tenuous correlations between parameter geometries. This paper introduces a fundamentally different and more direct paradigm: the Cartridge Activation Space Transfer (CAST), a novel framework that liberates LoRA-encoded behaviors by learning a direct, nonlinear mapping between the activation manifolds, the geometric structures formed by the model's internal neuron activations, of two distinct LLM architectures. CAST treats a pre-trained LoRA as a frozen "behavioral kernel." It learns a set of lightweight, bidirectional projection heads that translate the target model's activation stream into the source model's latent space, apply the frozen kernel, and project the result back. This process, trained on a general text corpus without any task-specific data, effectively decouples the learned skill from the source architecture. We demonstrate that CAST enables true "zero-shot" translation of any standard LoRA adapter. Our experiments, including transfers between heterogeneous model families like Llama-2 and Mistral, show that CAST-translated adapters achieve 85-95\% of the performance of a LoRA fully retrained on the target model, quantitatively outperforming current weight-space transfer techniques and establishing a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability.

Summary:<br /><br />
This study explores the impact of retrieval diversity on multi-turn intent understanding in task-oriented chatbots operating under tight token budgets and noisy contexts. The researchers propose a diversity-aware retrieval framework that selects in-context exemplars to balance intent coverage and linguistic variety, integrating this selection with standard language model (LLM) decoders. Through evaluations on MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD datasets, their approach achieves significant improvements in Joint Goal Accuracy under equal token budgets compared to strong LLM/DST baselines. The study includes sensitivity analyses over exemplar count, diversity strength, and backbone size, demonstrating consistent enhancements in performance across different parameters. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of content diversity in retrieval for building accurate multi-turn intent systems within budget constraints. <div>
arXiv:2510.17940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi turn intent understanding is central to task oriented chatbots, yet real deployments face tight token budgets and noisy contexts, and most retrieval pipelines emphasize relevance while overlooking set level diversity and confounds such as more context or exemplar order. We ask whether retrieval diversity, rather than longer prompts, systematically improves LLM intent understanding under fixed budgets. We present a diversity aware retrieval framework that selects in context exemplars to balance intent coverage and linguistic variety, and integrates this selection with standard LLM decoders; the evaluation enforces budget matched prompts and randomized positions, and includes sensitivity analyses over exemplar count, diversity strength, and backbone size. On MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD, the approach achieves strong gains in Joint Goal Accuracy under equal token budgets, surpassing strong LLM/DST baselines, with consistent improvements across K from 4 to 7 and moderate latency. Overall, the study isolates and validates the impact of content diversity in retrieval and offers a simple, deployable selection principle for building accurate, budget constrained multi turn intent systems.

This paper introduces a framework for synthesizing agentic data using only Large Language Models (LLMs), without human supervision. The framework utilizes modular pipelines to generate complete interaction records that include task specifications, tool definitions, policy pseudocode, natural language exchanges, and execution traces. It supports single-task, multi-task, and multi-turn agent interactions, allowing for the construction of datasets that reflect various tool-use competencies. The generated records adhere to strict syntactic and semantic constraints for machine-parseability and alignment across inputs, outputs, and tool calls. To ensure quality and consistency, the framework incorporates formats, JSON-schema validation, and judge-based filtering. By providing a reproducible alternative to manual data collection, this framework advances the development of agentic LLMs capable of robust tool use.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.17995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents, expected to decompose goals, invoke tools, and verify results in dynamic environments. Realizing these capabilities requires access to agentic data- structured interaction records that couple user intents with tool specifications, argument-grounded calls, and verifiable execution traces. However, collecting such data from human annotators is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to scale.
  We present a unified framework for synthesizing agentic data using only LLMs, without any human-in-the-loop supervision. This framework decomposes generation into modular pipelines that produce complete interaction records spanning task specifications, tool definitions, policy pseudocode, natural language exchanges, and execution traces. Records conform to strict syntactic and semantic constraints, ensuring machine-parseability and faithful alignment across inputs, outputs, and tool calls.
  Beyond single tasks, there is support for both multi-task and multi-turn agent interactions, enabling the construction of datasets that reflect the full spectrum of tool-use competencies. To ensure quality and consistency, the framework integrates constrained generation formats, JSON-schema validation, and judge-based filtering.
  This paper formalizes the schema for agentic records, details the prompt design principles that guide generation, and introduces scalable pipelines for high-quality synthetic data. By providing a reproducible, LLM-only alternative to manual collection, hence advancing the development of agentic LLMs capable of robust tool use.

Summary:
In this paper, the authors introduce a new multi-agent verbal reinforcement learning algorithm, called $\ours$, to enhance complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). They argue that effective agent communication is crucial for multi-agent reasoning and propose a dynamic approach to construct and refine collaboration structures. By evaluating communication robustness and coherence during debates, $\ours$ aims to improve the quality of interactions among LLM agents. The algorithm is tested on various tasks, such as mathematical reasoning, creative writing, scientific reasoning, and numerical sorting, showing significant performance improvements over single-agent prompting methods and existing multi-agent frameworks. The final decision is made through a majority vote among all agents, highlighting the importance of diverse perspectives in collaborative reasoning processes. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities in mathematical and scientific tasks. To enhance complex reasoning, multi-agent systems have been proposed to harness the collective intelligence of LLM agents. However, existing collaboration structures are either predefined or rely on majority voting or round-table debates, which can suppress correct but less dominant agent contributions. Recent approaches model multi-agent systems as graph networks but optimize purely for agent performance, neglecting the quality of interactions. We hypothesize that effective agent communication is crucial for multi-agent reasoning and that debating quality plays a significant role. To address this, we propose $\ours$, a multi-agent verbal reinforcement learning algorithm that dynamically constructs and refines multi-agent collaboration structures. Our method defines action spaces and a feedback mechanism that evaluates communication robustness and coherence throughout the debate. The final decision is achieved through a majority vote over all the agents. We assess $\ours$ on various reasoning tasks, including mathematical reasoning, creative writing, scientific reasoning, and numerical sorting. Results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms single-agent prompting methods and state-of-the-art multi-agent frameworks on diverse tasks.

Summary:
- The article proposes a formalized subject-event ontology for modeling complex dynamic systems without relying on global time.
- Events are defined as acts of fixation where a subject discerns and fixes changes according to conceptual models available to them.
- Causal order is determined by explicit dependencies rather than timestamps, ensuring deterministic execution via a declarative dataflow mechanism.
- Models act as epistemic filters, allowing subjects to only fix what falls under their known concepts and properties.
- The presumption of truth allows for the immediate availability of declarative content for computation without external verification.
- The formalization includes nine axioms to ensure the correctness of executable ontologies, including principles like monotonicity of history and acyclicity of causality.
- The model-based approach emphasizes event validation via schemas, actor authorization, and the automatic construction of causal chains without reliance on global time.
- Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea system, a workflow engine for executable ontologies utilizing the Boldsea Semantic Language.
- The formalization is useful for distributed systems, microservice architectures, DLT platforms, and scenarios involving conflicting facts from different subjects.

Abstract: A formalization of a subject-event ontology is proposed for modeling complex dynamic systems without reliance on global time. Key principles: (1) event as an act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models (conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before - the order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3) making the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring determinism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what falls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the declarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of fixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms (A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of history (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special attention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via schemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3) without global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea system - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical constructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language). The formalization is applicable to distributed systems, microservice architectures, DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios (conflicting facts from different subjects).

Summary: 
CompactPrompt is a new pipeline that combines prompt compression and data compression techniques to reduce the runtime costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic workflows. It prunes non-essential tokens from prompts and abbreviates recurrent textual patterns in attached documents while quantizing numerical columns. By integrating CompactPrompt into LLM agents, token usage and inference cost can be reduced by up to 60% on benchmark datasets like TAT-QA and FinQA, with only a slight decrease in output quality. The compression decisions made by CompactPrompt are visualized in real-time, allowing users to understand the trade-offs between cost and performance. This approach paves the way for more efficient generative AI pipelines.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful reasoning and generation capabilities but incur substantial run-time costs when operating in agentic workflows that chain together lengthy prompts and process rich data streams. We introduce CompactPrompt, an end-to-end pipeline that merges hard prompt compression with lightweight file-level data compression. CompactPrompt first prunes low-information tokens from prompts using self-information scoring and dependency-based phrase grouping. In parallel, it applies n-gram abbreviation to recurrent textual patterns in attached documents and uniform quantization to numerical columns, yielding compact yet semantically faithful representations. Integrated into standard LLM agents, CompactPrompt reduces total token usage and inference cost by up to 60% on benchmark dataset like TAT-QA and FinQA, while preserving output quality (Results in less than 5% accuracy drop for Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4.1-Mini) CompactPrompt helps visualize real-time compression decisions and quantify cost-performance trade-offs, laying the groundwork for leaner generative AI pipelines.

<div> planned diffusion, language model inference, autoregressive models, diffusion models, text generation
Summary:
Planned diffusion addresses the speed-quality trade-off in large language model inference by combining autoregressive and diffusion paradigms. It involves creating an autoregressive plan to break output into smaller spans, which are then generated simultaneously using diffusion. This approach improves text generation speed while maintaining high quality, achieving a Pareto-optimal trade-off on instruction-following prompts. Planned diffusion achieves a speedup of 1.27x to 1.81x over autoregressive generation with minimal drop in win rate. The planning mechanism is simple and reliable, with runtime knobs available for flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: A central challenge in large language model inference is the trade-off between generation speed and output quality. Autoregressive models produce high-quality text but generate tokens sequentially. Diffusion models can generate tokens in parallel but often need many iterations to match the same quality. We propose planned diffusion, a hybrid method that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Planned diffusion works in two stages: first, the model creates a short autoregressive plan that breaks the output into smaller, independent spans. Second, the model generates these spans simultaneously using diffusion. This approach expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides a practical path to faster, high-quality text generation. On AlpacaEval, a suite of 805 instruction-following prompts, planned diffusion achieves Pareto-optimal trade-off between quality and latency, achieving 1.27x to 1.81x speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87\% to 5.4\% drop in win rate, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the planning mechanism of planned diffusion is minimal and reliable, and simple runtime knobs exist to provide flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Select, Mix, and ReinvenT (SMaRT) framework, which aims to improve the performance and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating diverse reasoning strategies. Unlike existing methods that use LLMs as evaluators, SMaRT leverages them as intelligent integrators to combine different reasoning approaches. Empirical evaluations across various tasks show that SMaRT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality, constraint adherence, and performance metrics. This new paradigm in cross-strategy calibration redefines LLM-driven decision-making, offering superior outcomes and advancing self-refining methodologies. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have redefined complex task automation with exceptional generalization capabilities. Despite these advancements, state-of-the-art methods rely on single-strategy prompting, missing the synergy of diverse reasoning approaches. No single strategy excels universally, highlighting the need for frameworks that fuse strategies to maximize performance and ensure robustness. We introduce the Select, Mix, and ReinvenT (SMaRT) framework, an innovative strategy fusion approach designed to overcome this constraint by creating balanced and efficient solutions through the seamless integration of diverse reasoning strategies. Unlike existing methods, which employ LLMs merely as evaluators, SMaRT uses them as intelligent integrators, unlocking the "best of all worlds" across tasks. Extensive empirical evaluations across benchmarks in reasoning, planning, and sequential decision-making highlight the robustness and adaptability of SMaRT. The framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality, constraint adherence, and performance metrics. This work redefines LLM-driven decision-making by pioneering a new paradigm in cross-strategy calibration, unlocking superior outcomes for reasoning systems and advancing the boundaries of self-refining methodologies.

<div> dialectics, language model, reasoning, SIEV, evaluation
<br />
<br />
Summary: The article explores the concept of reasoning in language models and introduces a framework called SIEV based on dialectics, which evaluates the process of reasoning rather than just correct answers. It suggests that reasoning is a dynamic trajectory where ideas interact, clash, and evolve into deeper insights. The SIEV framework assesses a model's ability to resolve tension, integrate ideas, and synthesize higher-order reasoning. By applying this framework, significant reasoning gaps were uncovered in state-of-the-art models despite high scores on traditional benchmarks. For example, GPT-5-chat loses over 40 points out of 100 when evaluated using SIEV on GSM. The study emphasizes the importance of a process-oriented and philosophically grounded approach for a more rigorous and thorough assessment of language model reasoning. 
<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.18134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What does it truly mean for a language model to "reason"? Most current evaluations and benchmarks reward models' correct standalone answers--but correctness alone reveals little about the process that produced them. In this work, we explore a different perspective: reasoning is not a static chain of steps, but a dynamic trajectory where ideas interact, clash, and evolve into deeper insights. To capture this dynamic, we draw on a well-established philosophical tradition: \textit{dialectics}, where reasoning unfolds through thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Building on this, we present SIEV, a structured framework that evaluates reasoning of LLMs through dialectics. Unlike conventional evaluations, SIEV assesses not only the conclusion a model reaches, but how it gets there: its ability to resolve tension, integrate distinct ideas, and synthesize higher-order reasoning. This lens uncovers significant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models even under saturated benchmarks like GSM and MMLU. For instance, GPT-5-chat, a recent model, loses over 40 points (out of 100) when evaluated with SIEV on GSM. Our findings highlight that adopting a process-oriented, philosophically grounded approach enables a deeper, more rigorous, and more discriminative assessment of LLM reasoning.

Summary:
PaDA-Agent is a novel approach designed to enhance the performance of Small Language Models (SLMs) by streamlining the data augmentation process. Unlike existing methods that focus solely on model training errors, PaDA-Agent takes into account failure patterns extracted from validation data to create targeted data augmentation strategies. By directly targeting the generalization gap, PaDA-Agent demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model. This evaluation-driven approach reduces the manual effort required for data preparation and iterative optimization, making it a cost-effective and efficient solution for improving the accuracy of SLMs in complex domain-specific tasks. <div>

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in deployment cost and latency, but their accuracy often lags behind larger models, particularly for complex domain-specific tasks. While supervised fine-tuning can help bridge this performance gap, it requires substantial manual effort in data preparation and iterative optimization. We present PaDA-Agent (Pattern-guided Data Augmentation Agent), an evaluation-driven approach that streamlines the data augmentation process for SLMs through coordinated operations. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches that focus on model training errors only and generating error-correcting samples, PaDA-Agent discovers failure patterns from the validation data via evaluations and drafts targeted data augmentation strategies aiming to directly reduce the generalization gap. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based data augmentation approaches for Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model fine-tuning.

Summary:  
The paper introduces a new dataset for monitoring chain-of-thought reasoning in AI systems, focusing on sentence-level annotations of safety behaviors during LLM reasoning. Current approaches may miss harmful patterns or be circumvented, so this dataset fills a gap by enabling activation-based monitoring of safety behaviors. The dataset allows for detection and influencing of behaviors within model activations, improving safety oversight on reasoning. By analyzing activations, the dataset can detect and steer safety behaviors such as expressing safety concerns or speculating on user intent. This activation-level technique shows promise for enhancing AI safety by identifying specific behaviors within reasoning chains. <div>

Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the importance of monitoring chain-of-thought reasoning for AI safety; however, current approaches that analyze textual reasoning steps can miss subtle harmful patterns and may be circumvented by models that hide unsafe reasoning. We present a sentence-level labeled dataset that enables activation-based monitoring of safety behaviors during LLM reasoning. Our dataset contains reasoning sequences with sentence-level annotations of safety behaviors such as expression of safety concerns or speculation on user intent, which we use to extract steering vectors for detecting and influencing these behaviors within model activations. The dataset fills a key gap in safety research: while existing datasets label reasoning holistically, effective application of steering vectors for safety monitoring could be improved by identifying precisely when specific behaviors occur within reasoning chains. We demonstrate the dataset's utility by extracting representations that both detect and steer safety behaviors in model activations, showcasing the potential of activation-level techniques for improving safety oversight on reasoning.

<div> Keywords: consumer decision-making, marketing strategies, agents, social dynamics, LLM-powered simulation

Summary: 
This article presents a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate consumer decision-making and social dynamics in marketing scenarios. Traditional post-event analyses and rule-based agent-based models often fall short in capturing the intricacies of human behavior and interactions, making it challenging to design and evaluate marketing strategies effectively. By utilizing LLM-powered generative agents in a sandbox environment, this framework allows for the simulation of interactions, internal reasoning, habit formation, and purchasing decisions without predefined rules. In a simulated price-discount marketing scenario, the system provides valuable insights for testing marketing strategies and uncovers emergent social patterns that are typically missed by conventional methods. This innovative approach offers marketers a scalable and low-risk tool for pre-implementation testing, reducing the reliance on time-consuming post-event evaluations and minimizing the risk of underperforming campaigns.

Abstract: Simulating consumer decision-making is vital for designing and evaluating marketing strategies before costly real- world deployment. However, post-event analyses and rule-based agent-based models (ABMs) struggle to capture the complexity of human behavior and social interaction. We introduce an LLM-powered multi-agent simulation framework that models consumer decisions and social dynamics. Building on recent advances in large language model simulation in a sandbox envi- ronment, our framework enables generative agents to interact, express internal reasoning, form habits, and make purchasing decisions without predefined rules. In a price-discount marketing scenario, the system delivers actionable strategy-testing outcomes and reveals emergent social patterns beyond the reach of con- ventional methods. This approach offers marketers a scalable, low-risk tool for pre-implementation testing, reducing reliance on time-intensive post-event evaluations and lowering the risk of underperforming campaigns.

Summary:
The paper introduces Saber, a novel training-free sampling algorithm for Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) to improve inference speed and output quality in code generation tasks. By adaptively accelerating the generation process as more code context is established and incorporating a backtracking mechanism to reverse generated tokens, Saber achieves an average 1.9% improvement in Pass@1 accuracy and a 251.4% inference speedup compared to mainstream DLM sampling methods. This approach narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code generation by leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. <div>
arXiv:2510.18165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However, the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation. Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4% inference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work significantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code generation.

Summary: Goal changes are common in real-world interactions, prompting the creation of the AgentChangeBench benchmark to assess how language model agents adapt to shifting objectives in enterprise settings. The benchmark incorporates four evaluation metrics, including Task Success Rate, Tool Use Efficiency, Tool Call Redundancy Rate, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time. With 2,835 task sequences and various user personas, the benchmark evaluates the effectiveness, reliability, adaptation latency, and wasted effort of agents. The study reveals discrepancies in agent performance under dynamic goals, highlighting the importance of measuring recovery time and redundancy in assessing agent resilience. High accuracy does not necessarily equate to robustness in handling changing objectives, as demonstrated by contrasting results of different models in various enterprise domains. AgentChangeBench serves as a reproducible platform for enhancing agent resilience in realistic enterprise environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goal changes are a defining feature of real world multi-turn interactions, yet current agent benchmarks primarily evaluate static objectives or one-shot tool use. We introduce AgentChangeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to measure how tool augmented language model agents adapt to mid dialogue goal shifts across three enterprise domains. Our framework formalizes evaluation through four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR) for effectiveness, Tool Use Efficiency (TUE) for reliability, Tool Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) for wasted effort, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT) for adaptation latency. AgentChangeBench comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas, each designed to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows. Using this setup, we evaluate several frontier models and uncover sharp contrasts obscured by traditional $\text{pass}@k$ scores: for example, GPT-4o reaches $92.2\%$ recovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapses to $48.6\%$, and retail tasks show near perfect parameter validity yet redundancy rates above $80\%$, revealing major inefficiencies. These findings demonstrate that high raw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and that explicit measurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential. AgentChangeBench establishes a reproducible testbed for diagnosing and improving agent resilience in realistic enterprise settings.

<br />
Summary: This study investigates the impact of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) post-training on Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning tasks. The research finds that existing RLVR methods do not consider token-level advantages and primarily evaluate performance based on final answer correctness or Pass@K accuracy. The study introduces a measure called trace coherence to assess the consistency of reasoning steps in LLMs. Results show that RL post-training improves trace coherence, particularly on problems where the base model fails. However, it is noted that improved local coherence in reasoning steps does not always lead to final answer correctness. The study suggests that claims of enhanced reasoning through RL should be carefully analyzed, as improved trace coherence may not necessarily result in fully valid mathematical proofs.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.18176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)-based post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been shown to improve accuracy on reasoning tasks and continues to attract significant attention. Existing RLVR methods, however, typically treat all tokens uniformly without accounting for token-level advantages. These methods primarily evaluate performance based on final answer correctness or Pass@K accuracy, and yet make claims about RL post-training leading to improved reasoning traces. This motivates our investigation into the effect of RL post-training on intermediate tokens which are not directly incentivized. To study this, we design an experimental setup using the GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-0.5B model on the GSM8K dataset. We introduce trace coherence, a First-Order Logic (FOL)-based measure to capture the consistency of reasoning steps by identifying errors in the traces. We distinguish between trace validity and trace coherence, noting that the former implies logical soundness while the latter measures local coherence via lack of errors. Our results show that RL post-training overall improves trace coherence with the most significant gains on problems where the base model fails but the RL model succeeds. Surprisingly, RL enhances local coherence without necessarily producing valid or correct solutions. This highlights a crucial distinction: improved local coherence in reasoning steps does not guarantee final answer correctness. We argue that claims of improved reasoning via RL must be examined with care, as these may be based on improved trace coherence, which may not translate into fully valid mathematical proofs.

Abstract: The lack of a concrete definition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) obscures the gap between today's specialized AI and human-level cognition. This paper introduces a quantifiable framework to address this, defining AGI as matching the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult. To operationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory, the most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects general intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning, memory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to evaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly "jagged" cognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in knowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in foundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage. The resulting AGI scores (e.g., GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 58%) concretely quantify both rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data quality plays a critical role in enhancing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for large language models (LLMs), and token-level data selection has emerged as a promising direction for its fine-grained nature. Despite their strong empirical performance, existing token-level selection methods share two key limitations: (1) requiring training or accessing an additional reference model, and (2) relying solely on loss information for token selection, which cannot well preserve semantically important tokens that are not favored by loss-based metrics. To address these challenges, we propose ssToken, a Self-modulated and Semantic-aware Token Selection approach. ssToken leverages readily accessible history models to compute the per-token loss difference with the current model, which serves as a self-modulated signal that enables the model to adaptively select tokens along its optimization trajectory, rather than relying on excess loss from an offline-trained reference model as in prior works. We further introduce a semantic-aware, attention-based token importance estimation metric, orthogonal to loss-based selection and providing complementary semantic information for more effective filtering. Extensive experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that both self-modulated selection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning, while their integration--ssToken--achieves synergistic gains and further surpasses prior token-level selection methods, delivering performance improvements while maintaining training efficiency.

<title>Illusions of reflection: open-ended task reveals systematic failures in Large Language Models' reflective reasoning</title>

<div> Keywords: reflection, language models, reasoning, constraints, self-correction 

Summary: 
The study assesses the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in reflective reasoning compared to human performance. Eight frontier models were tested on an open-ended task with rule constraints to produce valid scientific test items and revise them after self-critique. Results showed poor initial performance and modest improvement after reflection, mainly driven by chance rather than deliberate error detection and constraint-sensitive repair. Performance declined with increased open-endedness, and models marketed for reasoning did not excel. The study suggests that current LLM reflection lacks goal-driven monitoring seen in humans, necessitating external structures to enforce constraints for reliable performance. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.18254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans do not just find mistakes after the fact -- we often catch them mid-stream because 'reflection' is tied to the goal and its constraints. Today's large language models produce reasoning tokens and 'reflective' text, but is it functionally equivalent with human reflective reasoning? Prior work on closed-ended tasks -- with clear, external 'correctness' signals -- can make 'reflection' look effective while masking limits in self-correction. We therefore test eight frontier models on a simple, real-world task that is open-ended yet rule-constrained, with auditable success criteria: to produce valid scientific test items, then revise after considering their own critique. First-pass performance is poor (often zero valid items out of 4 required; mean $\approx$ 1), and reflection yields only modest gains (also $\approx$ 1). Crucially, the second attempt frequently repeats the same violation of constraint, indicating 'corrective gains' arise largely from chance production of a valid item rather than error detection and principled, constraint-sensitive repair. Performance before and after reflection deteriorates as open-endedness increases, and models marketed for 'reasoning' show no advantage. Our results suggest that current LLM 'reflection' lacks functional evidence of the active, goal-driven monitoring that helps humans respect constraints even on a first pass. Until such mechanisms are instantiated in the model itself, reliable performance requires external structure that enforces constraints.

Summary: 
The article introduces Genesis, a new framework for web agent attacks that includes three modules: Attacker, Scorer, and Strategist. The Attacker utilizes a genetic algorithm and hybrid strategy representation to generate adversarial injections, while the Scorer evaluates the target web agent's responses. The Strategist dynamically uncovers effective strategies from interaction logs and compiles them into a strategy library that enhances the Attacker's effectiveness. Through extensive experiments on various web tasks, Genesis was found to discover novel strategies and outperform existing attack baselines. This framework aims to address the lack of studies on web agent attacks and the need for continuous discovery and evolution of attack strategies in automated web tasks. <div>

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly automate complex web tasks, they boost productivity while simultaneously introducing new security risks. However, relevant studies on web agent attacks remain limited. Existing red-teaming approaches mainly rely on manually crafted attack strategies or static models trained offline. Such methods fail to capture the underlying behavioral patterns of web agents, making it difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In web agent attacks, success requires the continuous discovery and evolution of attack strategies. To this end, we propose Genesis, a novel agentic framework composed of three modules: Attacker, Scorer, and Strategist. The Attacker generates adversarial injections by integrating the genetic algorithm with a hybrid strategy representation. The Scorer evaluates the target web agent's responses to provide feedback. The Strategist dynamically uncovers effective strategies from interaction logs and compiles them into a continuously growing strategy library, which is then re-deployed to enhance the Attacker's effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various web tasks show that our framework discovers novel strategies and consistently outperforms existing attack baselines.

Abstract: Geospatial data offers immense potential for understanding our planet. However, the sheer volume and diversity of this data along with its varied resolutions, timescales, and sparsity pose significant challenges for thorough analysis and interpretation. This paper introduces Earth AI, a family of geospatial AI models and agentic reasoning that enables significant advances in our ability to unlock novel and profound insights into our planet. This approach is built upon foundation models across three key domains--Planet-scale Imagery, Population, and Environment--and an intelligent Gemini-powered reasoning engine. We present rigorous benchmarks showcasing the power and novel capabilities of our foundation models and validate that when used together, they provide complementary value for geospatial inference and their synergies unlock superior predictive capabilities. To handle complex, multi-step queries, we developed a Gemini-powered agent that jointly reasons over our multiple foundation models along with large geospatial data sources and tools. On a new benchmark of real-world crisis scenarios, our agent demonstrates the ability to deliver critical and timely insights, effectively bridging the gap between raw geospatial data and actionable understanding.

<div> Keywords: Multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection, ShortcutBreaker, Transformer-based architectures, low-rank noisy bottleneck, global perturbation attention 

Summary: 
ShortcutBreaker is a novel framework designed for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (MUAD) tasks. It addresses the issue of identity shortcuts in existing models by introducing two key innovations. Firstly, the low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) prevents trivial identity reproduction by projecting high-dimensional features into a low-rank latent space based on matrix rank inequality. Secondly, a global perturbation attention is incorporated to prevent information shortcuts in the decoders by leveraging ViTs global modeling capability. The proposed method outperforms previous MUAD methods on four anomaly detection benchmarks, including industrial and medical datasets, achieving image-level AUROC scores of 99.8%, 98.9%, 90.6%, and 87.8% across the datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of ShortcutBreaker in improving anomaly detection performance and overcoming the limitations of existing models in distinguishing normal and abnormal cases. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) has garnered growing research interest, as it seeks to develop a unified model for anomaly detection across multiple classes, i.e., eliminating the need to train separate models for distinct objects and thereby saving substantial computational resources. Under the MUAD setting, while advanced Transformer-based architectures have brought significant performance improvements, identity shortcuts persist: they directly copy inputs to outputs, narrowing the gap in reconstruction errors between normal and abnormal cases, and thereby making the two harder to distinguish. Therefore, we propose ShortcutBreaker, a novel unified feature-reconstruction framework for MUAD tasks, featuring two key innovations to address the issue of shortcuts. First, drawing on matrix rank inequality, we design a low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) to project highdimensional features into a low-rank latent space, and theoretically demonstrate its capacity to prevent trivial identity reproduction. Second, leveraging ViTs global modeling capability instead of merely focusing on local features, we incorporate a global perturbation attention to prevent information shortcuts in the decoders. Extensive experiments are performed on four widely used anomaly detection benchmarks, including three industrial datasets (MVTec-AD, ViSA, and Real-IAD) and one medical dataset (Universal Medical). The proposed method achieves a remarkable image-level AUROC of 99.8%, 98.9%, 90.6%, and 87.8% on these four datasets, respectively, consistently outperforming previous MUAD methods across different scenarios.

Summary: 
Memory-Augmented State Machine Prompting (MASMP) is proposed as a framework for LLM agents in real-time strategy games. MASMP integrates state machine prompting with memory mechanisms to address challenges like hallucinations and fragmented decision-making. The framework includes a natural language-driven state machine architecture to guide LLMs and a memory module to preserve strategic variables. Experiments in StarCraft II show MASMP's 60% win rate against the hardest built-in AI, significantly outperforming baselines.

Abstract: This paper proposes Memory-Augmented State Machine Prompting (MASMP), a novel framework for LLM agents in real-time strategy games. Addressing key challenges like hallucinations and fragmented decision-making in existing approaches, MASMP integrates state machine prompting with memory mechanisms to unify structured actions with long-term tactical coherence. The framework features: (1) a natural language-driven state machine architecture that guides LLMs to emulate finite state machines and behavior trees through prompts, and (2) a lightweight memory module preserving strategic variables (e.g., tactics, priority units) across decision cycles. Experiments in StarCraft II demonstrate MASMP's 60% win rate against the hardest built-in AI (Lv7), vastly outperforming baselines (0%). Case studies reveal the method retains LLMs' semantic comprehension while resolving the "Knowing-Doing Gap" through strict state-action mapping, achieving both interpretability and FSM-like reliability. This work establishes a new paradigm for combining neural and symbolic AI in complex decision-making.

<div> framework, Autonomous Curriculum Learning, Heterogeneous Adversarial Play, teacher-student interactions, bidirectional feedback system

Summary:
Heterogeneous Adversarial Play (HAP) is introduced as an adversarial Automatic Curriculum Learning framework that enables teacher-student interactions through a minimax optimization approach. This framework addresses the challenge of asymmetry in autonomous skill acquisition by co-evolving task-generating instructors and problem-solving learners. Unlike existing Automatic Curriculum Learning methodologies, HAP incorporates a bidirectional feedback system where instructors adjust task complexity based on real-time learner performance metrics. Experimental results across multiple learning domains demonstrate HAP's efficacy in achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines, while also enhancing learning outcomes for both artificial agents and human subjects. This approach enables the autonomous synthesis of appropriate curricula without predetermined task hierarchies, leading to improved learning efficiency in open-ended learning scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2510.18407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-play constitutes a fundamental paradigm for autonomous skill acquisition, whereby agents iteratively enhance their capabilities through self-directed environmental exploration. Conventional self-play frameworks exploit agent symmetry within zero-sum competitive settings, yet this approach proves inadequate for open-ended learning scenarios characterized by inherent asymmetry. Human pedagogical systems exemplify asymmetric instructional frameworks wherein educators systematically construct challenges calibrated to individual learners' developmental trajectories. The principal challenge resides in operationalizing these asymmetric, adaptive pedagogical mechanisms within artificial systems capable of autonomously synthesizing appropriate curricula without predetermined task hierarchies. Here we present Heterogeneous Adversarial Play (HAP), an adversarial Automatic Curriculum Learning framework that formalizes teacher-student interactions as a minimax optimization wherein task-generating instructor and problem-solving learner co-evolve through adversarial dynamics. In contrast to prevailing ACL methodologies that employ static curricula or unidirectional task selection mechanisms, HAP establishes a bidirectional feedback system wherein instructors continuously recalibrate task complexity in response to real-time learner performance metrics. Experimental validation across multi-task learning domains demonstrates that our framework achieves performance parity with SOTA baselines while generating curricula that enhance learning efficacy in both artificial agents and human subjects.

<div> Keywords: Visual Language Models, Medical reasoning, Med-VRAgent, Visual Guidance, Monte Carlo Tree Search

Summary:
Visual Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in medical reasoning tasks but struggle with issues such as hallucinations, vague descriptions, inconsistent logic, and poor localization. In response to these challenges, the authors propose a framework called Medical Visual Reasoning Agent (Med-VRAgent). This approach combines Visual Guidance, Self-Reward paradigms, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance the medical visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Med-VRAgent uses a combination of Visual Guidance and tree search to improve performance. The trajectories generated by Med-VRAgent are used as feedback to fine-tune VLMs using proximal policy optimization (PPO) objectives. Experimental results on multiple medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches. This novel framework shows promise in addressing key challenges faced by VLMs in medical reasoning tasks.

<div> Keywords: urban waterlogging, monitoring, assessment, semi-supervised learning, foundation model<br />
Summary:<br />
The study introduces Urban Waterlogging Assessment (UWAssess) as a framework to automatically identify waterlogged areas in surveillance images and generate structured assessment reports. To tackle the lack of labeled data, the researchers implemented a semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy and a chain-of-thought prompting strategy to optimize the foundation model's performance for data-scarce tasks. The evaluations on visual benchmarks showed significant enhancements in perception performance. The framework's ability to generate reliable textual reports describing waterlogging extent, depth, risk, and impact was confirmed through GPT-based assessments. This shift from perception to generation in waterlogging monitoring could prove beneficial for urban management, disaster response, and climate resilience initiatives. The collaborative approach with multiple foundation models sets the stage for intelligent and scalable systems to address urban waterlogging challenges effectively.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With climate change intensifying, urban waterlogging poses an increasingly severe threat to global public safety and infrastructure. However, existing monitoring approaches rely heavily on manual reporting and fail to provide timely and comprehensive assessments. In this study, we present Urban Waterlogging Assessment (UWAssess), a foundation model-driven framework that automatically identifies waterlogged areas in surveillance images and generates structured assessment reports. To address the scarcity of labeled data, we design a semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy and a chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy to unleash the potential of the foundation model for data-scarce downstream tasks. Evaluations on challenging visual benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in perception performance. GPT-based evaluations confirm the ability of UWAssess to generate reliable textual reports that accurately describe waterlogging extent, depth, risk and impact. This dual capability enables a shift of waterlogging monitoring from perception to generation, while the collaborative framework of multiple foundation models lays the groundwork for intelligent and scalable systems, supporting urban management, disaster response and climate resilience.

AlphaOPT is a self-improving experience library that utilizes limited demonstrations and solver feedback to optimize optimization modeling tasks. It operates in a two-phase cycle: Library Learning and Library Evolution, where it extracts structured insights and refines applicability conditions to improve task transfer. This design allows for efficient learning without curated rationales, continual expansion without costly retraining, and explicit, interpretable knowledge for human intervention. Experimental results show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data and outperforms the strongest baseline when trained only on answers. The code and data for AlphaOPT are available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Optimization modeling enables critical decisions across industries but remains difficult to automate: informal language must be mapped to precise mathematical formulations and executable solver code. Prior LLM approaches either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone, without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts, extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition, explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights, and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data (65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only on answers. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/Minw913/AlphaOPT.

Summary:<br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making tasks, but face challenges in dealing with uncertainty. Two main types of uncertainty, LLM uncertainty and environmental uncertainty, hinder the adoption of LLMs for decision-making. PlanU is introduced as an LLM-based planning method that incorporates uncertainty within Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It models the return of each node in the MCTS as a quantile distribution to address uncertainty in decision-making tasks. PlanU utilizes a set of quantiles to represent the return distribution and introduces an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity (UCC) score to balance exploration and exploitation during tree search. Through experiments, PlanU is shown to be effective in addressing uncertainty in LLM-based decision-making tasks. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored across a range of decision-making tasks. However, LLMs sometimes struggle with decision-making tasks under uncertainty that are relatively easy for humans, such as planning actions in stochastic environments. The adoption of LLMs for decision-making is impeded by uncertainty challenges, such as LLM uncertainty and environmental uncertainty. LLM uncertainty arises from the stochastic sampling process inherent to LLMs. Most LLM-based Decision-Making (LDM) approaches address LLM uncertainty through multiple reasoning chains or search trees. However, these approaches overlook environmental uncertainty, which leads to poor performance in environments with stochastic state transitions. Some recent LDM approaches deal with uncertainty by forecasting the probability of unknown variables. However, they are not designed for multi-step decision-making tasks that require interaction with the environment. To address uncertainty in LLM decision-making, we introduce PlanU, an LLM-based planning method that captures uncertainty within Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). PlanU models the return of each node in the MCTS as a quantile distribution, which uses a set of quantiles to represent the return distribution. To balance exploration and exploitation during tree search, PlanU introduces an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity (UCC) score which estimates the uncertainty of MCTS nodes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PlanU in LLM-based decision-making tasks under uncertainty.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) have impressive reasoning abilities but often require expensive training on massive datasets. Traditional data selection methods use external models or heuristics, but this study focuses on the model's internal mechanisms. By identifying specialized attention heads involved in complex reasoning tasks, the researchers developed CircuitSeer, a data selection method based on measuring data's impact on crucial reasoning circuits. Extensive experiments on multiple models and datasets show CircuitSeer's effectiveness. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on a small subset chosen by CircuitSeer resulted in a significant performance improvement, demonstrating the method's efficiency. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, but scaling their performance often relies on massive reasoning datasets that are computationally expensive to train on. Existing data selection methods aim to curate smaller, high-quality subsets but often rely on costly external models or opaque heuristics. In this work, we shift the focus from external heuristics to the model's internal mechanisms. We find that complex reasoning tasks consistently activate a sparse, specialized subset of attention heads, forming core reasoning circuits. Building on this insight, we propose CircuitSeer, a novel data selection method that quantifies the reasoning complexity of data by measuring its influence on these crucial circuits. Extensive experiments on 4 models and 9 datasets demonstrate CircuitSeer's superiority. Notably, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on just 10% of data selected by our method achieves a 1.4-point gain in average Pass@1 over training on the full dataset, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.

Summary:
The article introduces a probabilistic intent modeling framework for large language model (LLM) agents engaged in multi-turn social dialogue. This framework maintains a belief distribution over a partner's latent intentions, starting from contextual priors and updating through likelihood estimation after each utterance. By evolving this distribution, the framework provides additional contextual grounding for the agent's policy, allowing it to adapt its dialogue strategies under uncertainty. Preliminary experiments conducted in the SOTOPIA environment demonstrate promising results: the proposed framework shows improvements in Overall score compared to baseline models, surpassing an oracle agent that directly observes partner intentions. These findings suggest that probabilistic intent modeling has the potential to enhance the development of socially intelligent LLM agents.

Abstract: We present a probabilistic intent modeling framework for large language model (LLM) agents in multi-turn social dialogue. The framework maintains a belief distribution over a partner's latent intentions, initialized from contextual priors and dynamically updated through likelihood estimation after each utterance. The evolving distribution provides additional contextual grounding for the policy, enabling adaptive dialogue strategies under uncertainty. Preliminary experiments in the SOTOPIA environment show consistent improvements: the proposed framework increases the Overall score by 9.0% on SOTOPIA-All and 4.1% on SOTOPIA-Hard compared with the Qwen2.5-7B baseline, and slightly surpasses an oracle agent that directly observes partner intentions. These early results suggest that probabilistic intent modeling can contribute to the development of socially intelligent LLM agents.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) have been successful in automating data analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries. However, existing LLM-agent-based frameworks lack privacy protection. On the other hand, federated analytics (FA) provides privacy-preserving computation but requires structured queries. LAFA integrates LLM-agent-based analytics with FA, using a hierarchical multi-agent architecture to transform natural language queries into optimized FA workflows. LAFA decomposes queries into sub-queries and maps them into FA operations using prior knowledge. An optimizer agent improves efficiency by eliminating redundant operations. Experimental results show LAFA outperforms baseline strategies, achieving higher success rates and reducing resource-intensive operations. This work paves the way for privacy-preserving LLM-driven analytics with natural language input in the FA setting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating multi-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering little to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks support for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable queries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural language input in the FA setting.

Summary:
StarBench introduces a turn-based RPG benchmark, focusing on human-like play skills such as multimodal decision-making and agentic information seeking. The benchmark evaluates agents' performance across eight combat tasks in two control regimes: direct control and tool-assisted control. In the direct control regime, agents must map raw screenshots to low-level actions without semantic hints, highlighting gaps in perception-to-control fidelity. Tool-assisted control allows higher-level intents to be converted into actions through detectors and OCR outputs for UI grounding. StarBench also includes a diagnostic to measure agents' choice to request guidance before proceeding and its impact on performance. Results show that judicious information seeking leads to improved success, establishing StarBench as a reproducible benchmark for evaluating multimodal decision-making and information seeking in real-client gameplay.<br /><br />Summary: StarBench benchmarks human-like play skills, evaluates vision-language models, focuses on multimodal decision-making and information seeking, exposes gaps in perception-to-control fidelity, and highlights the importance of guidance in improving agent performance. <div>

Abstract: Human players do more than press buttons: they ground what they see on screen into precise keyboard-mouse actions and, when stuck, they seek information before trying again. We ask whether current vision-language models (VLMs) can do the same. Despite encouraging results under simplified control or tool scaffolds, human-like play in a real client - mapping raw screenshots to temporally coherent low-level actions while deciding when to ask for guidance - remains an open challenge. We introduce StarBench, a turn-based RPG benchmark derived from Honkai: Star Rail that targets these two human-like competencies: multimodal decision-making from pixels to actions and agentic information seeking. StarBench standardizes evaluation across eight combat tasks and two regimes with shared tasks and metrics: (i) direct control, where agents receive only screenshots and must emit low-level primitives (click and keypress) with no semantic hints; and (ii) tool-assisted control, where higher-level intents can be mapped to primitives by detectors and OCR outputs provide optional textualized observations to ease UI grounding. To mirror human practice, StarBench also includes an ask-or-act diagnostic that measures whether and when agents choose to request brief guidance before proceeding, and how that choice affects subsequent performance. We report reference baselines for contemporary VLMs and a human reference. Results expose sizable gaps in perception-to-control fidelity in the direct regime, while showing that judicious information seeking correlates with improved success, establishing StarBench as a reproducible yardstick for agentic information seeking and multimodal decision-making in real-client play.

<div> Keywords: on-device virtual assistants, GUI agents, AndroidControl-Curated, SOTA model, Magma-R1

Summary: 
On-device virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are limited by rigid APIs, leading to the development of GUI agents as API-independent alternatives. However, existing benchmarks such as AndroidControl undervalue the capabilities of these agents due to shortcomings and errors. Researchers have enhanced the benchmark to AndroidControl-Curated, revealing that state-of-the-art models can achieve success rates nearing 75% on complex tasks, a 15% improvement. The new SOTA model, Magma-R1-3B, post-trained on a small dataset, outperforms larger models like Qwen3-VL-235B. The release of the AndroidControl-Curated benchmark and Magma-R1 model aims to accelerate the development of robust on-device virtual assistants by providing a more accurate assessment of their capabilities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: On-device virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are increasingly pivotal, yet their capabilities are hamstrung by a reliance on rigid, developer-dependent APIs. GUI agents offer a powerful, API-independent alternative, but their adoption is hindered by the perception of poor performance, as even the best models (e.g. Qwen3-VL-235B) scores are capped at around 60% on benchmarks like AndroidControl, far from viability for real-world use. Our research reveals that issue lies not only with the models but with the benchmarks themselves. We identified notable shortcomings in AndroidControl, including ambiguities and factual errors, which systematically underrates agent capabilities. To address this critical oversight, we enhanced AndroidControl into AndroidControl-Curated, a refined version of the benchmark improved through a rigorous purification pipeline. On this enhanced benchmark, state-of-the-art models achieve success rates nearing 75% on complex tasks (15% improvement), reflecting that on-device GUI agents are actually closer to practical deployment than previously thought. We introduce our new SOTA model, Magma-R1- 3B, post-trained on just 2.4k curated samples using 60 hours of an H20 GPU (approximately $60). Despite being 200 times smaller in parameters, this model delivers performance comparable to Qwen3- VL-235B. We release both AndroidControl-Curated benchmark and Magma-R1 model to the research community, encouraging adoption of this enhanced benchmark to better reflect model capabilities and accelerate the development of robust, on-device virtual assistants.

<div> Keywords: Control algorithms, Tuning Potential, Expert simulation, Algorithm analysis, Performance improvements

Summary: 
This study introduces Crucible, an agent that utilizes a multi-level expert simulation driven by LLM to tune control algorithms in production environments. Crucible addresses the crucial aspect of Tuning Potential, often overlooked in existing research. The agent formalizes a metric to quantitatively evaluate the algorithms' tunability across different scenarios. Through a series of case studies ranging from classic control tasks to complex computer systems, Crucible effectively quantifies the tunable space and provides insights for algorithm analysis and design. The experimental results demonstrate Crucible's ability to systematically evaluate and improve algorithm performance. Additionally, the study validates its findings through real-world deployment, showing practical applicability. The code for Crucible is openly available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Control algorithms in production environments typically require domain experts to tune their parameters and logic for specific scenarios. However, existing research predominantly focuses on algorithmic performance under ideal or default configurations, overlooking the critical aspect of Tuning Potential. To bridge this gap, we introduce Crucible, an agent that employs an LLM-driven, multi-level expert simulation to turn algorithms and defines a formalized metric to quantitatively evaluate their Tuning Potential. We demonstrate Crucible's effectiveness across a wide spectrum of case studies, from classic control tasks to complex computer systems, and validate its findings in a real-world deployment. Our experimental results reveal that Crucible systematically quantifies the tunable space across different algorithms. Furthermore, Crucible provides a new dimension for algorithm analysis and design, which ultimately leads to performance improvements. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-media/Crucible.

<div> Counterfactual reasoning, Pluralistic values, Large language models, Value alignment, Structural causal model <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces COUPLE, a framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) with pluralistic human values, considering the interdependence and prioritization among multiple value dimensions. COUPLE leverages a structural causal model (SCM) and counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with desired value objectives. By explicitly modeling causal relationships, COUPLE offers better interpretability and outperforms existing baselines in value alignment tasks on two datasets with different value systems. The framework addresses the challenges of value complexity and value steerability, providing a promising approach for integrating diverse value perspectives into LLM applications. <div>
arXiv:2510.18526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into applications serving users across diverse cultures, communities and demographics, it is critical to align LLMs with pluralistic human values beyond average principles (e.g., HHH). In psychological and social value theories such as Schwartz's Value Theory, pluralistic values are represented by multiple value dimensions paired with various priorities. However, existing methods encounter two challenges when aligning with such fine-grained value objectives: 1) they often treat multiple values as independent and equally important, ignoring their interdependence and relative priorities (value complexity); 2) they struggle to precisely control nuanced value priorities, especially those underrepresented ones (value steerability). To handle these challenges, we propose COUPLE, a COUnterfactual reasoning framework for PLuralistic valuE alignment. It introduces a structural causal model (SCM) to feature complex interdependency and prioritization among features, as well as the causal relationship between high-level value dimensions and behaviors. Moreover, it applies counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with any desired value objectives. Benefitting from explicit causal modeling, COUPLE also provides better interpretability. We evaluate COUPLE on two datasets with different value systems and demonstrate that COUPLE advances other baselines across diverse types of value objectives.

Summary: 
This study introduces an emulator for the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) that uses a combination of long- and short-term memory networks with a relaxed water-balance constraint to ensure operational resilience in hydrological and flood forecasting. The emulator is designed to handle data delays, missing data, and inconsistencies, with five different architectures representing varying levels of information availability. Trained on minimally managed catchments in the United States and tested in over 5,000 basins worldwide, including heavily regulated rivers in India, the emulator accurately replicates the hydrological core of GloFAS. It demonstrates smooth performance degradation as information quality decreases, showcasing its robustness in handling data scarcity and human influence. This framework highlights operational robustness as a key aspect of hydrological machine learning and contributes to the development of reliable real-time forecasting systems. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.18535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable hydrologic and flood forecasting requires models that remain stable when input data are delayed, missing, or inconsistent. However, most advances in rainfall-runoff prediction have been evaluated under ideal data conditions, emphasizing accuracy rather than operational resilience. Here, we develop an operationally ready emulator of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) that couples long- and short-term memory networks with a relaxed water-balance constraint to preserve physical coherence. Five architectures span a continuum of information availability: from complete historical and forecast forcings to scenarios with data latency and outages, allowing systematic evaluation of robustness. Trained in minimally managed catchments across the United States and tested in more than 5,000 basins, including heavily regulated rivers in India, the emulator reproduces the hydrological core of GloFAS and degrades smoothly as information quality declines. Transfer across contrasting hydroclimatic and management regimes yields reduced yet physically consistent performance, defining the limits of generalization under data scarcity and human influence. The framework establishes operational robustness as a measurable property of hydrological machine learning and advances the design of reliable real-time forecasting systems.

<div> Framework, SOCIA-Nabla, Simulator construction, LLM-driven agents, Textual-Gradient Descent

Summary:
SOCIA-Nabla is a new framework for simulator construction that treats the process as instance optimization over code within a textual computation graph. Specialized LLM-driven agents are used as graph nodes, with a workflow manager executing a loop that includes code synthesis, execution, evaluation, and code repair. The optimizer performs Textual-Gradient Descent, while human-in-the-loop interaction is only used for task-specific confirmation, reducing the need for expert effort. Across three CPS tasks, SOCIA-Nabla achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. By combining multi-agent orchestration with a loss-aligned optimization approach, SOCIA-Nabla transforms prompt pipelines into reproducible simulator code generation that can scale across different domains and simulation granularities. The work is currently under review, and the code will be released soon.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present SOCIA-Nabla, an end-to-end, agentic framework that treats simulator construction asinstance optimization over code within a textual computation graph. Specialized LLM-driven agents are embedded as graph nodes, and a workflow manager executes a loss-driven loop: code synthesis -> execution -> evaluation -> code repair. The optimizer performs Textual-Gradient Descent (TGD), while human-in-the-loop interaction is reserved for task-spec confirmation, minimizing expert effort and keeping the code itself as the trainable object. Across three CPS tasks, i.e., User Modeling, Mask Adoption, and Personal Mobility, SOCIA-Nabla attains state-of-the-art overall accuracy. By unifying multi-agent orchestration with a loss-aligned optimization view, SOCIA-Nabla converts brittle prompt pipelines into reproducible, constraint-aware simulator code generation that scales across domains and simulation granularities. This work is under review, and we will release the code soon.

Summary:  
- The study demonstrates the extraction of valuable alignment training data from a post-trained model to enhance capabilities such as long-context reasoning, safety, instruction following, and mathematics.  
- Utilizing embedding models proves more effective in identifying semantic similarities between strings compared to traditional metrics like edit distance.  
- Approximate string matching may underestimate the amount of extractable data due to trivial artifacts that deflate the metric.  
- Models tend to reproduce training data used in post-training phases like SFT or RL, which can be employed to train a base model and restore a significant portion of the original performance.  
- The research raises concerns about the potential risks associated with extracting alignment data and suggests that distillation practices indirectly train models on their original datasets.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show that it is possible to extract significant amounts of alignment training data from a post-trained model -- useful to steer the model to improve certain capabilities such as long-context reasoning, safety, instruction following, and maths. While the majority of related work on memorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction through string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for our specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model can identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such as edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation, approximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative estimate of $10\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial artifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily regurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or RL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a meaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a possibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work opens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation practices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set, distillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's original dataset.

Abstract: Automating quantitative trading strategy development in dynamic markets is challenging, especially with increasing demand for personalized investment solutions. Existing methods often fail to explore the vast strategy space while preserving the diversity essential for robust performance across changing market conditions. We present QuantEvolve, an evolutionary framework that combines quality-diversity optimization with hypothesis-driven strategy generation. QuantEvolve employs a feature map aligned with investor preferences, such as strategy type, risk profile, turnover, and return characteristics, to maintain a diverse set of effective strategies. It also integrates a hypothesis-driven multi-agent system to systematically explore the strategy space through iterative generation and evaluation. This approach produces diverse, sophisticated strategies that adapt to both market regime shifts and individual investment needs. Empirical results show that QuantEvolve outperforms conventional baselines, validating its effectiveness. We release a dataset of evolved strategies to support future research.

The paper introduces Visual Attention Reasoning (VAR), a novel framework that aims to reduce hallucination tendencies and enhance reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). VAR breaks down the reasoning process into two key stages: evidence grounding and chain-of-thought generation with a backtracking mechanism for self-correction. The framework utilizes a multi-faceted reward function to guide the search process, penalizing outputs that are not grounded in the visual input. The theoretical analysis validates the search strategy's effectiveness in finding correct solutions.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), despite their advances, are hindered by their high hallucination tendency and heavy reliance on brittle, linear reasoning processes, leading to failures in complex tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce Visual Attention Reasoning (VAR), a novel framework that recasts grounded reasoning as a structured search over a reasoning trajectory space. VAR decomposes the reasoning process into two key stages: traceable evidence grounding and search-based chain-of-thought (CoT) generation, which incorporates a backtracking mechanism for self-correction. The search is guided by a multi-faceted reward function with semantic and geometric self-verification components, which penalize outputs that are not faithfully grounded in the visual input. We provide a theoretical analysis for our search strategy, validating its capability to find the correct solution with high probability. Experimental results show that our 7B model, VAR-7B, sets a new state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of hallucination and safety benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing open-source models and demonstrating competitive performance against leading proprietary systems.

Abstract: We present a new approach to classification that combines data and knowledge. In this approach, data mining is used to derive association rules (possibly with negations) from data. Those rules are leveraged to increase the predictive performance of tree-based models (decision trees and random forests) used for a classification task. They are also used to improve the corresponding explanation task through the generation of abductive explanations that are more general than those derivable without taking such rules into account. Experiments show that for the two tree-based models under consideration, benefits can be offered by the approach in terms of predictive performance and in terms of explanation sizes.

Summary:
In this new research article, the focus is on modelling qualitative uncertainty in formal argumentation, a crucial aspect for both practical applications and theoretical understanding. Unlike previous works that mostly concentrate on abstract models, this study delves into studying plausible instantiations of these abstract models. The uncertainty of arguments is grounded in their components, organized within rules and premises. The key technical contributions include introducing a notion of expressivity that can handle both abstract and structured formalisms, along with presenting negative and positive expressivity results to compare abstract and structured models of argumentation with uncertainty. These results have implications for incomplete abstract argumentation frameworks, their extension with dependencies, and ASPIC+ on the structured side. <div>

Abstract: Modelling qualitative uncertainty in formal argumentation is essential both for practical applications and theoretical understanding. Yet, most of the existing works focus on \textit{abstract} models for arguing with uncertainty. Following a recent trend in the literature, we tackle the open question of studying plausible instantiations of these abstract models. To do so, we ground the uncertainty of arguments in their components, structured within rules and premises. Our main technical contributions are: i) the introduction of a notion of expressivity that can handle abstract and structured formalisms, and ii) the presentation of both negative and positive expressivity results, comparing the expressivity of abstract and structured models of argumentation with uncertainty. These results affect incomplete abstract argumentation frameworks, and their extension with dependencies, on the abstract side, and ASPIC+, on the structured side.

Summary: 
Retrieval-augmented generation systems, like RAG, address complex user queries by decomposing them, retrieving relevant documents, and generating answers. An important trade-off in this process involves the balance between broad retrieval and limiting to avoid noise and high cost. The study formulates this as an exploitation-exploration problem, with document retrieval as a sequential decision-making process. Different bandit learning methods were experimented with and found effective in dynamically selecting informative sub-queries. Using rank information and human judgments to estimate document relevance resulted in significant improvements in document-level precision, alpha-nDCG, and overall performance in long-form generation tasks. <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems address complex user requests by decomposing them into subqueries, retrieving potentially relevant documents for each, and then aggregating them to generate an answer. Efficiently selecting informative documents requires balancing a key trade-off: (i) retrieving broadly enough to capture all the relevant material, and (ii) limiting retrieval to avoid excessive noise and computational cost. We formulate query decomposition and document retrieval in an exploitation-exploration setting, where retrieving one document at a time builds a belief about the utility of a given sub-query and informs the decision to continue exploiting or exploring an alternative. We experiment with a variety of bandit learning methods and demonstrate their effectiveness in dynamically selecting the most informative sub-queries. Our main finding is that estimating document relevance using rank information and human judgments yields a 35% gain in document-level precision, 15% increase in {\alpha}-nDCG, and better performance on the downstream task of long-form generation.

Summary:  
<br />SherlockLLM is a dialogue-driven retrieval framework that utilizes Reinforcement Learning to optimize the questioning strategy in information retrieval systems. The framework aims to efficiently narrow down search space by generating a sequence of binary questions to clarify user intent and improve system performance. SherlockLLM is trained without the need for large-scale annotated dialogue data and demonstrates robust and efficient performance in both structured and unstructured tasks. On structured tasks, it matches strong baselines and approaches the theoretical optimal defined by binary search. In contrast, on challenging unstructured tasks, SherlockLLM outperforms the baselines significantly, showcasing its ability to learn a highly effective information-seeking dialogue policy. <div>
arXiv:2510.18659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User queries in information retrieval are often ambiguous, making it challenging for systems to identify a user's target from a single query. While recent dialogue-based interactive retrieval systems can clarify user intent, they are inefficient as they often lack an explicit strategy to ask the most informative questions. To address this limitation, we propose SherlockLLM, a dialogue-driven retrieval framework that learns an optimal questioning strategy via Reinforcement Learning (RL) and avoids the need for large-scale annotated dialogue data. In our framework, an agent is trained to generate a sequence of binary questions to efficiently narrow down the search space. To validate our approach, we introduce a benchmark with both structured and unstructured tasks. Experimental results show that SherlockLLM is a robust and efficient solution. On the structured tasks, its performance matches strong baselines and approaches the theoretical optimal defined by binary search. On the challenging unstructured task, our agent significantly outperforms these baselines, showcasing its ability to learn a highly effective information-seeking dialogue policy.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying the occurrence of harmful algal bloom (HAB), particularly cyanobacteria, which threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health through oxygen depletion, toxin release, and disruption of marine biodiversity. Traditional monitoring approaches, such as manual water sampling, remain labor-intensive and limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing have shown potential for scalable AI-driven solutions, yet challenges remain in reasoning over imagery and quantifying bloom severity. In this work, we introduce ALGae Observation and Segmentation (ALGOS), a segmentation-and-reasoning system for HAB monitoring that combines remote sensing image understanding with severity estimation. Our approach integrates GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation for high-quality segmentation mask curation and fine-tunes vision language model on severity prediction using the Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels (CAML) from NASA. Experiments demonstrate that ALGOS achieves robust performance on both segmentation and severity-level estimation, paving the way toward practical and automated cyanobacterial monitoring systems.

Abstract: Optimizing national scientific investment requires a clear understanding of evolving research trends and the demographic and geographical forces shaping them, particularly in light of commitments to equity, diversity, and inclusion. This study addresses this need by analyzing 18 years (2005-2022) of research proposals funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). We conducted a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three topic modelling approaches: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Structural Topic Modelling (STM), and BERTopic. We also introduced a novel algorithm, named COFFEE, designed to enable robust covariate effect estimation for BERTopic. This advancement addresses a significant gap, as BERTopic lacks a native function for covariate analysis, unlike the probabilistic STM. Our findings highlight that while all models effectively delineate core scientific domains, BERTopic outperformed by consistently identifying more granular, coherent, and emergent themes, such as the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence. Additionally, the covariate analysis, powered by COFFEE, confirmed distinct provincial research specializations and revealed consistent gender-based thematic patterns across various scientific disciplines. These insights offer a robust empirical foundation for funding organizations to formulate more equitable and impactful funding strategies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the scientific ecosystem.

<div> optimize visual space, zero-shot learning, visual prototype, embedding space, multilayer perceptron

Summary: 
Optimizing the visual space is essential for enhancing zero-shot learning models. Two strategies are proposed to achieve this goal. The first method involves learning visual prototypes for each class to represent them in the visual space more effectively. The second approach focuses on optimizing the visual feature structure in an intermediate embedding space using a multilayer perceptron framework-based algorithm. The experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets show that optimizing the visual space improves zero-shot learning performance. The visual prototype-based method outperforms existing approaches and achieves the new state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot learning. <div>

Abstract: Zero-shot learning, which aims to recognize new categories that are not included in the training set, has gained popularity owing to its potential ability in the real-word applications. Zero-shot learning models rely on learning an embedding space, where both semantic descriptions of classes and visual features of instances can be embedded for nearest neighbor search. Recently, most of the existing works consider the visual space formulated by deep visual features as an ideal choice of the embedding space. However, the discrete distribution of instances in the visual space makes the data structure unremarkable. We argue that optimizing the visual space is crucial as it allows semantic vectors to be embedded into the visual space more effectively. In this work, we propose two strategies to accomplish this purpose. One is the visual prototype based method, which learns a visual prototype for each visual class, so that, in the visual space, a class can be represented by a prototype feature instead of a series of discrete visual features. The other is to optimize the visual feature structure in an intermediate embedding space, and in this method we successfully devise a multilayer perceptron framework based algorithm that is able to learn the common intermediate embedding space and meanwhile to make the visual data structure more distinctive. Through extensive experimental evaluation on four benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that optimizing visual space is beneficial for zero-shot learning. Besides, the proposed prototype based method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance.

<div> 6GHz, high-capacity access, Wi-Fi, 5G, LBT <br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
An agentic controller for managing unlicensed 6GHz networks is proposed, separating policy from execution. Using telemetry data, a large language model suggests adjustments for fairness and duty-cycle caps, optimizing energy efficiency and throughput while accounting for safety. The controller consistently improves energy efficiency and maintains competitive throughput with a rule baseline in a simulated 6GHz network. By internalizing LBT losses and energy costs, the controller's policies outperform the baseline in various trade-offs, demonstrating the benefits of transparent, policy-level guidance from a language model in enhancing wireless coexistence. <div>

Abstract: Unlicensed 6GHz is becoming a primary workhorse for high-capacity access, with Wi-Fi and 5G NR-U competing for the same channels under listen-before-talk (LBT) rules. Operating in this regime requires decisions that jointly trade throughput, energy, and service-level objectives while remaining safe and auditable. We present an agentic controller that separates {policy} from {execution}. At the start of each scheduling epoch the agent summarizes telemetry (per-channel busy and baseline LBT failure; per-user CQI, backlog, latency, battery, priority, and power mode) and invokes a large language model (LLM) to propose a small set of interpretable knobs: a fairness index \alpha, per-channel duty-cycle caps for Wi-Fi/NR-U, and class weights. A deterministic optimizer then enforces feasibility and computes an \alpha-fair allocation that internalizes LBT losses and energy cost; malformed or unsafe policies are clamped and fall back to a rule baseline. In a 6GHz simulator with two 160MHz channels and mixed Wi-Fi/NR-U users, LLM-assisted policies consistently improve energy efficiency while keeping throughput competitive with a strong rule baseline. One LLM lowers total energy by 35.3% at modest throughput loss, and another attains the best overall trade-off, finishing with higher total bits (+3.5%) and higher bits/J (+12.2%) than the baseline. We release code, per-epoch logs, and plotting utilities to reproduce all figures and numbers, illustrating how transparent, policy-level LLM guidance can safely improve wireless coexistence.

Summary:<br />
Recent advancements in neural interfacing have led to improvements in human-computer interaction, rehabilitation, and neuromuscular diagnostics. Traditional blind source separation methods for motor unit decomposition from surface electromyography data often lack accuracy and interpretability due to the absence of biophysical constraints. A new Biophysical-Model-Informed Source Separation framework has been introduced, integrating anatomically accurate forward EMG models into the decomposition process. This approach utilizes MRI-based anatomical reconstructions and generative modeling to estimate neural drive and motor neuron properties in an unsupervised manner, resulting in higher fidelity motor unit estimation with reduced computational cost compared to traditional methods. The framework has potential applications in clinical diagnostics, prosthetic control, and neurorehabilitation, paving the way for non-invasive personalized neuromuscular assessments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in neural interfacing have enabled significant improvements in human-computer interaction, rehabilitation, and neuromuscular diagnostics. Motor unit (MU) decomposition from surface electromyography (sEMG) is a key technique for extracting neural drive information, but traditional blind source separation (BSS) methods fail to incorporate biophysical constraints, limiting their accuracy and interpretability. In this work, we introduce a novel Biophysical-Model-Informed Source Separation (BMISS) framework, which integrates anatomically accurate forward EMG models into the decomposition process. By leveraging MRI-based anatomical reconstructions and generative modeling, our approach enables direct inversion of a biophysically accurate forward model to estimate both neural drive and motor neuron properties in an unsupervised manner. Empirical validation in a controlled simulated setting demonstrates that BMISS achieves higher fidelity motor unit estimation while significantly reducing computational cost compared to traditional methods. This framework paves the way for non-invasive, personalized neuromuscular assessments, with potential applications in clinical diagnostics, prosthetic control, and neurorehabilitation.

Abstract: Integrated Satellite Aerial Terrestrial Networks (ISATNs) are envisioned as key enablers of 6G, providing global connectivity for applications such as autonomous transportation, Industrial IoT, and disaster response. Their large-scale deployment, however, risks unsustainable energy use and carbon emissions. This work advances prior energy-aware studies by proposing a carbon-aware orchestration framework for ISATNs that leverages Digital Twin (DT) technology. The framework adopts grams of CO$_2$-equivalent per bit (gCO$_2$/bit) as a primary sustainability metric and implements a multi timescale Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) loop that combines day-ahead forecasting with real-time adaptive optimization. ISATN-specific control knobs, including carbon-aware handovers, UAV duty cycling, and renewable-aware edge placement, are exploited to reduce emissions. Simulation results with real carbon intensity data show up to 29\% lower gCO$_2$/bit than QoS-only orchestration, while improving renewable utilization and resilience under adverse events.

Abstract: Building a working mental model of a protein typically requires weeks of reading, cross-referencing crystal and predicted structures, and inspecting ligand complexes, an effort that is slow, unevenly accessible, and often requires specialized computational skills. We introduce \emph{Speak to a Protein}, a new capability that turns protein analysis into an interactive, multimodal dialogue with an expert co-scientist. The AI system retrieves and synthesizes relevant literature, structures, and ligand data; grounds answers in a live 3D scene; and can highlight, annotate, manipulate and see the visualization. It also generates and runs code when needed, explaining results in both text and graphics. We demonstrate these capabilities on relevant proteins, posing questions about binding pockets, conformational changes, or structure-activity relationships to test ideas in real-time. \emph{Speak to a Protein} reduces the time from question to evidence, lowers the barrier to advanced structural analysis, and enables hypothesis generation by tightly coupling language, code, and 3D structures. \emph{Speak to a Protein} is freely accessible at https://open.playmolecule.org.

Abstract: Inertial fusion energy promises nearly unlimited, clean power if it can be achieved. However, the design and engineering of fusion systems requires controlling and manipulating matter at extreme energies and timescales; the shock physics and radiation transport governing the physical behavior under these conditions are complex requiring the development, calibration, and use of predictive multiphysics codes to navigate the highly nonlinear and multi-faceted design landscape. We hypothesize that artificial intelligence reasoning models can be combined with physics codes and emulators to autonomously design fusion fuel capsules. In this article, we construct a multi-agent system where natural language is utilized to explore the complex physics regimes around fusion energy. The agentic system is capable of executing a high-order multiphysics inertial fusion computational code. We demonstrate the capacity of the multi-agent design assistant to both collaboratively and autonomously manipulate, navigate, and optimize capsule geometry while accounting for high fidelity physics that ultimately achieve simulated ignition via inverse design.

<title>Synthetic EEG Generation using Diffusion Models for Motor Imagery Tasks</title>

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used, non-invasive method for capturing brain activity, and is particularly relevant for applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). However, collecting high-quality EEG data remains a major challenge due to sensor costs, acquisition time, and inter-subject variability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a methodology for generating synthetic EEG signals associated with motor imagery brain tasks using Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). The approach involves preprocessing real EEG data, training a diffusion model to reconstruct EEG channels from noise, and evaluating the quality of the generated signals through both signal-level and task-level metrics. For validation, we employed classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and U-Net to compare the performance of synthetic data against real data in classification tasks. The generated data achieved classification accuracies above 95%, with low mean squared error and high correlation with real signals.
  Our results demonstrate that synthetic EEG signals produced by diffusion models can effectively complement datasets, improving classification performance in EEG-based BCIs and addressing data scarcity.

Abstract: Do brains and language models converge toward the same internal representations of the world? Recent years have seen a rise in studies of neural activations and model alignment. In this work, we review 25 fMRI-based studies published between 2023 and 2025 and explicitly confront their findings with two key hypotheses: (i) the Platonic Representation Hypothesis -- that as models scale and improve, they converge to a representation of the real world, and (ii) the Intermediate-Layer Advantage -- that intermediate (mid-depth) layers often encode richer, more generalizable features. Our findings provide converging evidence that models and brains may share abstract representational structures, supporting both hypotheses and motivating further research on brain-model alignment.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in Large Language Model capabilities, tool retrieval for agent-based systems remains fundamentally limited by reliance on semantic similarity, which fails to capture functional viability. Current methods often retrieve textually relevant but functionally inoperative tools due to parameter mismatches, authentication failures, and execution constraints--a phenomenon we term the semantic-functional gap. We introduce GRETEL, to address this gap through systematic empirical validation. GRETEL implements an agentic workflow that processes semantically retrieved candidates through sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, generating execution-grounded evidence to distinguish truly functional tools from merely descriptive matches. Our comprehensive evaluation on the ToolBench benchmark demonstrates substantial improvements across all metrics: Pass Rate (at 10) increases from 0.690 to 0.826, Recall (at 10) improves from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG (at 10) rises from 0.807 to 0.857.. These results establish that execution-based validation provides a more reliable foundation for tool selection than semantic similarity alone, enabling more robust agent performance in real-world applications.

Using parameter-efficient fine-tuning on emotionally rich dialogues, the system was evaluated across eight personalized conditions. An LLM as a judge approach showed a 71.2\% preference for the fine-tuned model, with improved emotional depth and reduced output variance, demonstrating its potential for adaptive, personalized cognition.

Abstract: Multi-label image classification demands adaptive training strategies to navigate complex, evolving visual-semantic landscapes, yet conventional methods rely on static configurations that falter in dynamic settings. We propose MAT-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that reimagines training as a collaborative, real-time optimization process. By deploying autonomous agents to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss functions, MAT-Agent leverages non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward harmonizing accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhanced with dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training, it ensures robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across Pascal VOC, COCO, and VG-256 demonstrate MAT-Agent's superiority: it achieves an mAP of 97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T), OF1 of 92.3, and CF1 of 91.4 on Pascal VOC; an mAP of 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), OF1 of 88.2, and CF1 of 87.1 on COCO; and an mAP of 60.9, OF1 of 70.8, and CF1 of 61.1 on VG-256. With accelerated convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, MAT-Agent offers a scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models, paving the way for adaptive deep learning advancements.

Abstract: Prognostic Health Management (PHM) systems monitor and predict equipment health. A key task is Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation, which predicts how long a component, such as a rolling element bearing, will operate before failure. Many RUL methods exist but often lack generalizability and robustness under changing operating conditions. This paper introduces CARLE, a hybrid AI framework that combines deep and shallow learning to address these challenges. CARLE uses Res-CNN and Res-LSTM blocks with multi-head attention and residual connections to capture spatial and temporal degradation patterns, and a Random Forest Regressor (RFR) for stable, accurate RUL prediction. A compact preprocessing pipeline applies Gaussian filtering for noise reduction and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for time-frequency feature extraction. We evaluate CARLE on the XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA bearing datasets. Ablation studies measure each component's contribution, while noise and cross-domain experiments test robustness and generalization. Comparative results show CARLE outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, especially under dynamic conditions. Finally, we analyze model interpretability with LIME and SHAP to assess transparency and trustworthiness.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with a median survival of approximately 15 months. In clinical practice, the Stupp protocol serves as the standard first-line treatment. However, patients exhibit highly heterogeneous therapeutic responses which required at least two months before first visual impact can be observed, typically with MRI. Early prediction treatment response is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Disease Progression Modeling (DPM) aims to capture the trajectory of disease evolution, while Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) focuses on assessing the impact of therapeutic interventions. Whereas most TRP approaches primarly rely on timeseries data, we consider the problem of early visual TRP as a slice-to-slice translation model generating post-treatment MRI from a pre-treatment MRI, thus reflecting the tumor evolution. To address this problem we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with a concatenation-based conditioning from the pre-treatment MRI and the tumor localization, and a classifier-free guidance to enhance generation quality using survival information, in particular post-treatment tumor evolution. Our model were trained and tested on a local dataset consisting of 140 GBM patients collected at Centre Fran\c{c}ois Baclesse. For each patient we collected pre and post T1-Gd MRI, tumor localization manually delineated in the pre-treatment MRI by medical experts, and survival information.

Abstract: With the growing role of artificial intelligence in climate and weather research, efficient model training and inference are in high demand. Current models like FourCastNet and AI-GOMS depend heavily on GPUs, limiting hardware independence, especially for Chinese domestic hardware and frameworks. To address this issue, we present a framework for migrating large-scale atmospheric and oceanic models from PyTorch to MindSpore and optimizing for Chinese chips, and evaluating their performance against GPUs. The framework focuses on software-hardware adaptation, memory optimization, and parallelism. Furthermore, the model's performance is evaluated across multiple metrics, including training speed, inference speed, model accuracy, and energy efficiency, with comparisons against GPU-based implementations. Experimental results demonstrate that the migration and optimization process preserves the models' original accuracy while significantly reducing system dependencies and improving operational efficiency by leveraging Chinese chips as a viable alternative for scientific computing. This work provides valuable insights and practical guidance for leveraging Chinese domestic chips and frameworks in atmospheric and oceanic AI model development, offering a pathway toward greater technological independence.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce MUSE (Model-based Uncertainty-aware Similarity Estimation), a training-free framework designed for model-based zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation. MUSE leverages 2D multi-view templates rendered from 3D unseen objects and 2D object proposals extracted from input query images. In the embedding stage, it integrates class and patch embeddings, where the patch embeddings are normalized using generalized mean pooling (GeM) to capture both global and local representations efficiently. During the matching stage, MUSE employs a joint similarity metric that combines absolute and relative similarity scores, enhancing the robustness of matching under challenging scenarios. Finally, the similarity score is refined through an uncertainty-aware object prior that adjusts for proposal reliability. Without any additional training or fine-tuning, MUSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across the Classic Core, H3, and Industrial tracks. These results demonstrate that MUSE offers a powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation.

Abstract: Gender classification systems often inherit and amplify demographic imbalances in their training data. We first audit five widely used gender classification datasets, revealing that all suffer from significant intersectional underrepresentation. To measure the downstream impact of these flaws, we train identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the two most balanced of these datasets, UTKFace and FairFace. Our fairness evaluation shows that even these models exhibit significant bias, misclassifying female faces at a higher rate than male faces and amplifying existing racial skew. To counter these data-induced biases, we construct BalancedFace, a new public dataset created by blending images from FairFace and UTKFace, supplemented with images from other collections to fill missing demographic gaps. It is engineered to equalize subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only real, unedited images. When a standard classifier is trained on BalancedFace, it reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over 50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of 1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, all with a minimal loss of overall accuracy. These results underline the profound value of data-centric interventions and provide an openly available resource for fair gender classification research.

Abstract: Agentic systems interact with external systems by calling tools such as Python functions, REST API endpoints, or command line tools such as kubectl in Kubernetes. These tool calls often fail for various syntactic and semantic reasons. Some less obvious semantic errors can only be identified and resolved after analyzing the tool's response. To repair these errors, we develop a post-tool execution reflection component that combines large language model (LLM)-based reflection with domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using documents describing both the specific tool being called and troubleshooting documents related to the tool. For this paper, we focus on the use case of the kubectl command line tool to manage Kubernetes, a platform for orchestrating cluster applications. Through a larger empirical study and a smaller manual evaluation, we find that our RAG-based reflection will repair kubectl commands such that they are both more likely to successfully execute (pass rate) for 55% of our models evaluated and 36% more likely to correctly answer the user query on average. We find that troubleshooting documents improve pass rate compared to official documentation by an average of 10%.

Abstract: 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation (3D WSSS) aims to achieve semantic segmentation by leveraging sparse or low-cost annotated data, significantly reducing reliance on dense point-wise annotations. Previous works mainly employ class activation maps or pre-trained vision-language models to address this challenge. However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient exploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical bottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation method that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance mechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed methodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more balanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial refinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific optimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is developed, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to effectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with geometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive unlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates Self-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process continuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage, ultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models. Comprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks while demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised settings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design.

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems provide a new paradigm for reconfigurable and flexible wireless communications. To enable more energy efficient and spectrum efficient IRS assisted UAV wireless communications, this paper introduces a novel IRS-assisted UAV enabled spectrum sharing system with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The goal is to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the secondary network by jointly optimizing the beamforming, subcarrier allocation, IRS phase shifts, and the UAV trajectory subject to practical transmit power and passive reflection constraints as well as UAV physical limitations. A physically grounded propulsion-energy model is adopted, with its tight upper bound used to form a tractable EE lower bound for the spectrum sharing system. To handle highly non convex, time coupled optimization problems with a mixed continuous and discrete policy space, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach based on the actor critic framework. Extended experiments show the significant EE improvement of the proposed DRL-based approach compared to several benchmark schemes, thus demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach with mobility.

Abstract: EEG-based person identification enables applications in security, personalized brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), and cognitive monitoring. However, existing techniques often rely on deep learning architectures at high computational cost, limiting their scope of applications. In this study, we propose a novel EEG person identification approach using spiking neural networks (SNNs) with a lightweight spiking transformer for efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed SNN model is capable of handling the temporal complexities inherent in EEG signals. On the EEG-Music Emotion Recognition Challenge dataset, the proposed model achieves 100% classification accuracy with less than 10% energy consumption of traditional deep neural networks. This study offers a promising direction for energy-efficient and high-performance BCIs. The source code is available at https://github.com/PatrickZLin/Decode-ListenerIdentity.

<title>Outraged AI: Large language models prioritise emotion over cost in fairness enforcement</title>

Abstract: Emotions guide human decisions, but whether large language models (LLMs) use emotion similarly remains unknown. We tested this using altruistic third-party punishment, where an observer incurs a personal cost to enforce fairness, a hallmark of human morality and often driven by negative emotion. In a large-scale comparison of 4,068 LLM agents with 1,159 adults across 796,100 decisions, LLMs used emotion to guide punishment, sometimes even more strongly than humans did: Unfairness elicited stronger negative emotion that led to more punishment; punishing unfairness produced more positive emotion than accepting; and critically, prompting self-reports of emotion causally increased punishment. However, mechanisms diverged: LLMs prioritized emotion over cost, enforcing norms in an almost all-or-none manner with reduced cost sensitivity, whereas humans balanced fairness and cost. Notably, reasoning models (o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1) were more cost-sensitive and closer to human behavior than foundation models (GPT-3.5, DeepSeek-V3), yet remained heavily emotion-driven. These findings provide the first causal evidence of emotion-guided moral decisions in LLMs and reveal deficits in cost calibration and nuanced fairness judgements, reminiscent of early-stage human responses. We propose that LLMs progress along a trajectory paralleling human development; future models should integrate emotion with context-sensitive reasoning to achieve human-like emotional intelligence.

<title>POPI: Personalizing LLMs via Optimized Natural Language Preference Inference</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, yet user experiences remain inconsistent due to diverse preferences in style, tone, and reasoning mode. Nevertheless, existing alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) largely optimize toward population-level averages and overlook individual variation. Naive personalization strategies like per-user fine-tuning are computationally prohibitive, and in-context approaches that prepend raw user signals often suffer from inefficiency and noise. To address these challenges, we propose POPI, a general framework that introduces a preference inference model to distill heterogeneous user signals into concise natural language summaries. These summaries act as transparent, compact, and transferable personalization representations that condition a shared generation model to produce personalized responses. POPI jointly optimizes both preference inference and personalized generation under a unified objective using reinforcement learning, ensuring summaries maximally encode useful preference information. Extensive experiments across four personalization benchmarks demonstrate that POPI consistently improves personalization accuracy while reducing context overhead by a large margin. Moreover, optimized summaries seamlessly transfer to frozen off-the-shelf LLMs, enabling plug-and-play personalization without weight updates.

<title>Does GenAI Rewrite How We Write? An Empirical Study on Two-Million Preprints</title>

Abstract: Preprint repositories become central infrastructures for scholarly communication. Their expansion transforms how research is circulated and evaluated before journal publication. Generative large language models (LLMs) introduce a further potential disruption by altering how manuscripts are written. While speculation abounds, systematic evidence of whether and how LLMs reshape scientific publishing remains limited.
  This paper addresses the gap through a large-scale analysis of more than 2.1 million preprints spanning 2016--2025 (115 months) across four major repositories (i.e., arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, SocArXiv). We introduce a multi-level analytical framework that integrates interrupted time-series models, collaboration and productivity metrics, linguistic profiling, and topic modeling to assess changes in volume, authorship, style, and disciplinary orientation. Our findings reveal that LLMs have accelerated submission and revision cycles, modestly increased linguistic complexity, and disproportionately expanded AI-related topics, while computationally intensive fields benefit more than others. These results show that LLMs act less as universal disruptors than as selective catalysts, amplifying existing strengths and widening disciplinary divides. By documenting these dynamics, the paper provides the first empirical foundation for evaluating the influence of generative AI on academic publishing and highlights the need for governance frameworks that preserve trust, fairness, and accountability in an AI-enabled research ecosystem.

<title>From Flows to Words: Can Zero-/Few-Shot LLMs Detect Network Intrusions? A Grammar-Constrained, Calibrated Evaluation on UNSW-NB15</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can reason over natural-language inputs, but their role in intrusion detection without fine-tuning remains uncertain. This study evaluates a prompt-only approach on UNSW-NB15 by converting each network flow to a compact textual record and augmenting it with lightweight, domain-inspired boolean flags (asymmetry, burst rate, TTL irregularities, timer anomalies, rare service/state, short bursts). To reduce output drift and support measurement, the model is constrained to produce structured, grammar-valid responses, and a single decision threshold is calibrated on a small development split. We compare zero-shot, instruction-guided, and few-shot prompting to strong tabular and neural baselines under identical splits, reporting accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and macro scores. Empirically, unguided prompting is unreliable, while instructions plus flags substantially improve detection quality; adding calibrated scoring further stabilizes results. On a balanced subset of two hundred flows, a 7B instruction-tuned model with flags reaches macro-F1 near 0.78; a lighter 3B model with few-shot cues and calibration attains F1 near 0.68 on one thousand examples. As the evaluation set grows to two thousand flows, decision quality decreases, revealing sensitivity to coverage and prompting. Tabular baselines remain more stable and faster, yet the prompt-only pipeline requires no gradient training, produces readable artifacts, and adapts easily through instructions and flags. Contributions include a flow-to-text protocol with interpretable cues, a calibration method for thresholding, a systematic baseline comparison, and a reproducibility bundle with prompts, grammar, metrics, and figures.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language understanding and generation have sparked interest in their potential for cybersecurity applications, including password guessing. In this study, we conduct an empirical investigation into the efficacy of pre-trained LLMs for password cracking using synthetic user profiles. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art open-source LLMs such as TinyLLaMA, Falcon-RW-1B, and Flan-T5 by prompting them to generate plausible passwords based on structured user attributes (e.g., name, birthdate, hobbies). Our results, measured using Hit@1, Hit@5, and Hit@10 metrics under both plaintext and SHA-256 hash comparisons, reveal consistently poor performance, with all models achieving less than 1.5% accuracy at Hit@10. In contrast, traditional rule-based and combinator-based cracking methods demonstrate significantly higher success rates. Through detailed analysis and visualization, we identify key limitations in the generative reasoning of LLMs when applied to the domain-specific task of password guessing. Our findings suggest that, despite their linguistic prowess, current LLMs lack the domain adaptation and memorization capabilities required for effective password inference, especially in the absence of supervised fine-tuning on leaked password datasets. This study provides critical insights into the limitations of LLMs in adversarial contexts and lays the groundwork for future efforts in secure, privacy-preserving, and robust password modeling.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created unprecedented demands for computational power, yet methods for evaluating the performance, efficiency, and environmental impact of deployed models remain fragmented. Current approaches often fail to provide a holistic view, making it difficult to compare and optimise systems across heterogeneous hardware, software stacks, and numeric precisions. To address this gap, we propose a unified and reproducible methodology for AI model inference that integrates computational and environmental metrics under realistic serving conditions. Our framework provides a pragmatic, carbon-aware evaluation by systematically measuring latency and throughput distributions, energy consumption, and location-adjusted carbon emissions, all while maintaining matched accuracy constraints for valid comparisons. We apply this methodology to multi-precision models across diverse hardware platforms, from data-centre accelerators like the GH200 to consumer-level GPUs such as the RTX 4090, running on mainstream software stacks including PyTorch, TensorRT, and ONNX Runtime. By systematically categorising these factors, our work establishes a rigorous benchmarking framework that produces decision-ready Pareto frontiers, clarifying the trade-offs between accuracy, latency, energy, and carbon. The accompanying open-source code enables independent verification and facilitates adoption, empowering researchers and practitioners to make evidence-based decisions for sustainable AI deployment.

Abstract: Kanerva (2014) suggested that it would be possible to construct a complete Lisp out of a vector-symbolic architecture. We present the general form of a vector-symbolic representation of the five Lisp elementary functions, lambda expressions, and other auxiliary functions, found in the Lisp 1.5 specification McCarthy (1960), which is near minimal and sufficient for Turing-completeness. Our specific implementation uses holographic reduced representations Plate (1995), with a lookup table cleanup memory. Lisp, as all Turing-complete languages, is a Cartesian closed category, unusual in its proximity to the mathematical abstraction. We discuss the mathematics, the purpose, and the significance of demonstrating vector-symbolic architectures' Cartesian-closure, as well as the importance of explicitly including cleanup memories in the specification of the architecture.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to a surge of open-source models across diverse domains. While model merging offers a promising way to combine their strengths, existing approaches often suffer from parameter conflicts that degrade performance on domain-specific tasks. We propose MIN-Merging, a router-based framework that selectively merges the most important neurons to reduce such conflicts. Extensive experiments on Computer Vision(CV) and Natural Language Processing(NLP) benchmarks show that MIN-Merging achieves consistent gains on in-domain tasks while retaining the generalization ability of pretrained models on out-of-domain tasks. These results highlight its effectiveness as a practical solution to the parameter conflict problem in model merging.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, raising concerns about privacy, security and the need to remove undesirable knowledge. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution, yet faces two key challenges: (1) practical unlearning needs are often continuous and heterogeneous, and (2) they involve decentralized, sensitive data with asymmetric access. These factors result in inter-domain and intra-domain interference, which further amplifies the dilemma of unbalanced forgetting and retaining performance. In response, we propose a federated unlearning approach for LLMs that is scalable and privacy preserving. Our method decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning and employs a hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives and enables robust, adaptable unlearning updates. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks of WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU showed that our approach effectively handles heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared with baseline methods.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet their standard attention mechanism incurs quadratic computation and memory costs with respect to sequence length, posing a major bottleneck for long-context training. Prior work tackles this challenge along two directions: (1) kernel-level optimizations, which accelerate dense and sparse attention operators; and (2) module-level strategies, often referred to as distributed attention or context parallel training, which scale attention across multiple devices. However, systematic evaluation still remains limited: operator-level comparisons are often incomplete, while context parallel strategies are typically framework-specific, with unclear performance analysis across contexts. To address these gaps, we propose a unified benchmark that integrates representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with a modular and extensible interface for evaluation. The benchmark evaluates methods along two critical dimensions: (1) attention mask patterns, which strongly affect efficiency, scalability, and usability, and (2) sequence length and distributed scale, which determine performance under extreme long-context training. Through comprehensive experiments on the cluster of up to 96 GPUs, our benchmark enables reproducible comparisons, highlights method-specific trade-offs, and provides practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in long-context LLM training.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enables the scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) to trillions of parameters by activating a sparse subset of weights for each input, maintaining constant computational cost during inference. Concurrently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant technique for parameter-efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on specialized tasks. In this work, we unify these two paradigms into a novel, end-to-end trainable framework named L-MoE: a Lightweight Mixture of LoRA Experts. L-MoE redefines MoE experts not as dense feed-forward networks, but as a collection of task-specialized, low-rank adapters. A lightweight gating network, trained jointly with the experts, learns to dynamically compose these LoRA adapters by computing a weighted average of their parameters for each input token. This composition is fully differentiable, allowing gradients from a standard auto-regressive language modeling objective to flow back through the entire architecture, simultaneously refining both the expert adapters and the routing strategy. This approach creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is modular by design, allows for dynamic skill composition, and is trainable from end-to-end. We present the formal mathematical framework for L-MoE, detailing the differentiable routing mechanism and the joint optimization objective, thereby providing a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and specialized language models.

<title>Automated Algorithm Design for Auto-Tuning Optimizers</title>

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is essential for optimizing high-performance applications, where vast and irregular parameter spaces make manual exploration infeasible. Traditionally, auto-tuning relies on well-established optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms, annealing methods, or surrogate model-based optimizers to efficiently find near-optimal configurations. However, designing effective optimizers remains challenging, as no single method performs best across all tuning tasks.
  In this work, we explore a new paradigm: using large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate optimization algorithms tailored to auto-tuning problems. We introduce a framework that prompts LLMs with problem descriptions and search-space characteristics results to produce specialized optimization strategies, which are iteratively examined and improved.
  These generated algorithms are evaluated on four real-world auto-tuning applications across six hardware platforms and compared against the state-of-the-art in optimization algorithms of two contemporary auto-tuning frameworks. The evaluation demonstrates that providing additional application- and search space-specific information in the generation stage results in an average performance improvement of 30.7\% and 14.6\%, respectively. In addition, our results show that LLM-generated optimizers can rival, and in various cases outperform, existing human-designed algorithms, with our best-performing generated optimization algorithms achieving, on average, 72.4\% improvement over state-of-the-art optimizers for auto-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are entering legal workflows, yet we lack a jurisdiction-specific framework to assess their baseline competence therein. We use India's public legal examinations as a transparent proxy. Our multi-year benchmark assembles objective screens from top national and state exams and evaluates open and frontier LLMs under real-world exam conditions. To probe beyond multiple-choice questions, we also include a lawyer-graded, paired-blinded study of long-form answers from the Supreme Court's Advocate-on-Record exam. This is, to our knowledge, the first exam-grounded, India-specific yardstick for LLM court-readiness released with datasets and protocols. Our work shows that while frontier systems consistently clear historical cutoffs and often match or exceed recent top-scorer bands on objective exams, none surpasses the human topper on long-form reasoning. Grader notes converge on three reliability failure modes: procedural or format compliance, authority or citation discipline, and forum-appropriate voice and structure. These findings delineate where LLMs can assist (checks, cross-statute consistency, statute and precedent lookups) and where human leadership remains essential: forum-specific drafting and filing, procedural and relief strategy, reconciling authorities and exceptions, and ethical, accountable judgment.

<title>The Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning Paradigm to Minimize the Number of Communications</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative decentralized training across multiple parties (nodes) while keeping raw data private. There are two main paradigms in FL: Horizontal FL (HFL), where all participant nodes share the same feature space but hold different samples, and Vertical FL (VFL), where participants hold complementary features for the same samples. While HFL is widely adopted, VFL is employed in domains where nodes hold complementary features about the same samples. Still, VFL presents a significant limitation: the vast number of communications required during training. This compromises privacy and security, and can lead to high energy consumption, and in some cases, make model training unfeasible due to the high number of communications.
  In this paper, we introduce Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning (SBVFL), a novel paradigm that leverages a distributed training mechanism enhanced for privacy and security. Decoupling the vast majority of node updates from the server dramatically reduces node-server communication. Experiments show that SBVFL reduces communication by ~99% compared to standard VFL while maintaining accuracy and robustness. Therefore, SBVFL enables practical, privacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, cybersecurity, and the defense industry.

Abstract: The proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing structured data and adhering to syntactic rules is a capability that drives their widespread adoption but also makes them paradoxically vulnerable. In this paper, we investigate this vulnerability through BreakFun, a jailbreak methodology that weaponizes an LLM's adherence to structured schemas. BreakFun employs a three-part prompt that combines an innocent framing and a Chain-of-Thought distraction with a core "Trojan Schema"--a carefully crafted data structure that compels the model to generate harmful content, exploiting the LLM's strong tendency to follow structures and schemas. We demonstrate this vulnerability is highly transferable, achieving an average success rate of 89% across 13 foundational and proprietary models on JailbreakBench, and reaching a 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) on several prominent models. A rigorous ablation study confirms this Trojan Schema is the attack's primary causal factor. To counter this, we introduce the Adversarial Prompt Deconstruction guardrail, a defense that utilizes a secondary LLM to perform a "Literal Transcription"--extracting all human-readable text to isolate and reveal the user's true harmful intent. Our proof-of-concept guardrail demonstrates high efficacy against the attack, validating that targeting the deceptive schema is a viable mitigation strategy. Our work provides a look into how an LLM's core strengths can be turned into critical weaknesses, offering a fresh perspective for building more robustly aligned models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in education, yet their correctness alone does not capture the quality, reliability, or pedagogical validity of their problem-solving behavior, especially in mathematics, where multistep logic, symbolic reasoning, and conceptual clarity are critical. Conventional evaluation methods largely focus on final answer accuracy and overlook the reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a novel interpretability framework for analyzing LLM-generated solutions using undergraduate calculus problems as a representative domain. Our approach combines reasoning flow extraction and decomposing solutions into semantically labeled operations and concepts with prompt ablation analysis to assess input salience and output stability. Using structured metrics such as reasoning complexity, phrase sensitivity, and robustness, we evaluated the model behavior on real Calculus I to III university exams. Our findings revealed that LLMs often produce syntactically fluent yet conceptually flawed solutions, with reasoning patterns sensitive to prompt phrasing and input variation. This framework enables fine-grained diagnosis of reasoning failures, supports curriculum alignment, and informs the design of interpretable AI-assisted feedback tools. This is the first study to offer a structured, quantitative, and pedagogically grounded framework for interpreting LLM reasoning in mathematics education, laying the foundation for the transparent and responsible deployment of AI in STEM learning environments.

Abstract: Simulating nuanced human social dynamics with Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge, particularly in achieving psychological depth and consistent persona behavior crucial for high-fidelity training tools. This paper introduces TACLA (Transactional Analysis Contextual LLM-based Agents), a novel Multi-Agent architecture designed to overcome these limitations. TACLA integrates core principles of Transactional Analysis (TA) by modeling agents as an orchestrated system of distinct Parent, Adult, and Child ego states, each with its own pattern memory. An Orchestrator Agent prioritizes ego state activation based on contextual triggers and an agent's life script, ensuring psychologically authentic responses. Validated in an educational scenario, TACLA demonstrates realistic ego state shifts in Student Agents, effectively modeling conflict de-escalation and escalation based on different teacher intervention strategies. Evaluation shows high conversational credibility and confirms TACLA's capacity to create dynamic, psychologically-grounded social simulations, advancing the development of effective AI tools for education and beyond.

Abstract: We introduce NeuCo-Bench, a novel benchmark framework for evaluating (lossy) neural compression and representation learning in the context of Earth Observation (EO). Our approach builds on fixed-size embeddings that act as compact, task-agnostic representations applicable to a broad range of downstream tasks. NeuCo-Bench comprises three core components: (i) an evaluation pipeline built around reusable embeddings, (ii) a new challenge mode with a hidden-task leaderboard designed to mitigate pretraining bias, and (iii) a scoring system that balances accuracy and stability. To support reproducibility, we release SSL4EO-S12-downstream, a curated multispectral, multitemporal EO dataset. We present initial results from a public challenge at the 2025 CVPR EARTHVISION workshop and conduct ablations with state-of-the-art foundation models. NeuCo-Bench provides a first step towards community-driven, standardized evaluation of neural embeddings for EO and beyond.

<title>Uncertainty-Aware Post-Hoc Calibration: Mitigating Confidently Incorrect Predictions Beyond Calibration Metrics</title>

Abstract: Despite extensive research on neural network calibration, existing methods typically apply global transformations that treat all predictions uniformly, overlooking the heterogeneous reliability of individual predictions. Furthermore, the relationship between improved calibration and effective uncertainty-aware decision-making remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a post-hoc calibration framework that leverages prediction reliability assessment to jointly enhance calibration quality and uncertainty-aware decision-making. The framework employs proximity-based conformal prediction to stratify calibration samples into putatively correct and putatively incorrect groups based on semantic similarity in feature space. A dual calibration strategy is then applied: standard isotonic regression calibrated confidence in putatively correct predictions, while underconfidence-regularized isotonic regression reduces confidence toward uniform distributions for putatively incorrect predictions, facilitating their identification for further investigations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using calibration metrics, uncertainty-aware performance measures, and empirical conformal coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones show that the proposed method achieves lower confidently incorrect predictions, and competitive Expected Calibration Error compared with isotonic and focal-loss baselines. This work bridges calibration and uncertainty quantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc solution that requires no model retraining while improving both probability alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

<title>Self-Evidencing Through Hierarchical Gradient Decomposition: A Dissipative System That Maintains Non-Equilibrium Steady-State by Minimizing Variational Free Energy</title>

Abstract: The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that self-organizing systems must minimize variational free energy to persist, but the path from principle to implementable algorithm has remained unclear. We present a constructive proof that the FEP can be realized through exact local credit assignment. The system decomposes gradient computation hierarchically: spatial credit via feedback alignment, temporal credit via eligibility traces, and structural credit via a Trophic Field Map (TFM) that estimates expected gradient magnitude for each connection block. We prove these mechanisms are exact at their respective levels and validate the central claim empirically: the TFM achieves 0.9693 Pearson correlation with oracle gradients. This exactness produces emergent capabilities including 98.6% retention after task interference, autonomous recovery from 75% structural damage, self-organized criticality (spectral radius p ~= 1.0$), and sample-efficient reinforcement learning on continuous control tasks without replay buffers. The architecture unifies Prigogine's dissipative structures, Friston's free energy minimization, and Hopfield's attractor dynamics, demonstrating that exact hierarchical inference over network topology can be implemented with local, biologically plausible rules.

<title>Data Unlearning Beyond Uniform Forgetting via Diffusion Time and Frequency Selection</title>

Abstract: Data unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples from a trained model without requiring full retraining. Unlike concept unlearning, data unlearning in diffusion models remains underexplored and often suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. To address this, we first observe that most existing methods attempt to unlearn the samples at all diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor-quality generation. We argue that forgetting occurs disproportionately across time and frequency, depending on the model and scenarios. By selectively focusing on specific time-frequency ranges during training, we achieve samples with higher aesthetic quality and lower noise. We validate this improvement by applying our time-frequency selective approach to diverse settings, including gradient-based and preference optimization objectives, as well as both image-level and text-to-image tasks. Finally, to evaluate both deletion and quality of unlearned data samples, we propose a simple normalized version of SSCD. Together, our analysis and methods establish a clearer understanding of the unique challenges in data unlearning for diffusion models, providing practical strategies to improve both evaluation and unlearning performance.

<title>JT-Safe: Intrinsically Enhancing the Safety and Trustworthiness of LLMs</title>

Abstract: The hallucination and credibility concerns of large language models (LLMs) are global challenges that the industry is collectively addressing. Recently, a significant amount of advances have been made on post-training and inference techniques to mitigate these challenges. However, it is widely agreed that unsafe and hallucinations of LLMs intrinsically originate from pre-training, involving pre-training data and the next-token prediction learning mechanism. In this paper, we focus on enhancing pre-training data to improve the trustworthiness and safety of LLMs. Since the data is vast, it's almost impossible to entirely purge the data of factual errors, logical inconsistencies, or distributional biases. Moreover, the pre-training data lack grounding in real-world knowledge. Each piece of data is treated as a sequence of tokens rather than as a representation of a part of the world. To overcome these issues, we propose approaches to enhancing our pre-training data with its context in the world and increasing a substantial amount of data reflecting industrial scenarios. We argue that most source data are created by the authors for specific purposes in a certain spatial-temporal context. They have played a role in the real world. By incorporating related world context information, we aim to better anchor pre-training data within real-world scenarios, thereby reducing uncertainty in model training and enhancing the model's safety and trustworthiness. We refer to our Data with World Context as DWC. We continue pre-training an earlier checkpoint of JT-35B-Base with 1.5 trillion of DWC tokens. We introduce our post-training procedures to activate the potentials of DWC. Compared with the Qwen model of a similar scale, JT-Safe-35B achieves an average performance improvement of 1.79% on the Safety and Trustworthy evaluation benchmarks, while being pretrained with only 6.2 trillion tokens.

Abstract: Smart contracts play a significant role in automating blockchain services. Nevertheless, vulnerabilities in smart contracts pose serious threats to blockchain security. Currently, traditional detection methods primarily rely on static analysis and formal verification, which can result in high false-positive rates and poor scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently made significant progress in smart contract vulnerability detection. However, they still face challenges such as high inference costs and substantial computational overhead. In this paper, we propose ParaVul, a parallel LLM and retrieval-augmented framework to improve the reliability and accuracy of smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we first develop Sparse Low-Rank Adaptation (SLoRA) for LLM fine-tuning. SLoRA introduces sparsification by incorporating a sparse matrix into quantized LoRA-based LLMs, thereby reducing computational overhead and resource requirements while enhancing their ability to understand vulnerability-related issues. We then construct a vulnerability contract dataset and develop a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates dense retrieval with Best Matching 25 (BM25), assisting in verifying the results generated by the LLM. Furthermore, we propose a meta-learning model to fuse the outputs of the RAG system and the LLM, thereby generating the final detection results. After completing vulnerability detection, we design chain-of-thought prompts to guide LLMs to generate comprehensive vulnerability detection reports. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of ParaVul, especially in terms of F1 scores, achieving 0.9398 for single-label detection and 0.9330 for multi-label detection.

Abstract: The dynamics of tumor-immune interactions within a complex tumor microenvironment are typically modeled using a system of ordinary differential equations or partial differential equations. These models introduce some unknown parameters that need to be estimated accurately and efficiently from the limited and noisy experimental data. Moreover, due to the intricate biological complexity and limitations in experimental measurements, tumor-immune dynamics are not fully understood, and therefore, only partial knowledge of the underlying physics may be available, resulting in unknown or missing terms within the system of equations. In this study, we develop a cancer biology-informed neural network model(CBINN) to infer the unknown parameters in the system of equations as well as to discover the missing physics from sparse and noisy measurements. We test the performance of the CBINN model on three distinct nonlinear compartmental tumor-immune models and evaluate its robustness across multiple synthetic noise levels. By harnessing these highly nonlinear dynamics, our CBINN framework effectively estimates the unknown model parameters and uncovers the underlying physical laws or mathematical structures that govern these biological systems, even from scattered and noisy measurements. The models chosen here represent the dynamic patterns commonly observed in compartmental models of tumor-immune interactions, thereby validating the generalizability and efficacy of our methodology.

Abstract: Recent advances in enhancing the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) have been remarkably successful. LLMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning demonstrate strong performance in challenging tasks such as mathematics and coding, even with relatively small model sizes. However, despite these improvements in task accuracy, the assessment of creativity in LLM generations has been largely overlooked in reasoning tasks, in contrast to writing tasks. The lack of research on creativity assessment in reasoning primarily stems from two challenges: (1) the difficulty of defining the range of creativity, and (2) the necessity of human evaluation in the assessment process. To address these challenges, we propose CLAWS, a method that defines and classifies mathematical solutions into typical, creative, and hallucinated categories without human evaluation, by leveraging attention weights across prompt sections and output. CLAWS outperforms five existing white-box detection methods (Perplexity, Logit Entropy, Window Entropy, Hidden Score, and Attention Score) on five 7-8B math RL models (DeepSeek, Qwen, Mathstral, OpenMath2, and Oreal). We validate CLAWS on 4545 math problems collected from 181 math contests (AJHSME, AMC, AIME).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and planning capabilities, driving extensive research into task decomposition. Existing task decomposition methods focus primarily on memory, tool usage, and feedback mechanisms, achieving notable success in specific domains, but they often overlook the trade-off between performance and cost. In this study, we first conduct a comprehensive investigation on task decomposition, identifying six categorization schemes. Then, we perform an empirical analysis of three factors that influence the performance and cost of task decomposition: categories of approaches, characteristics of tasks, and configuration of decomposition and execution models, uncovering three critical insights and summarizing a set of practical principles. Building on this analysis, we propose the Select-Then-Decompose strategy, which establishes a closed-loop problem-solving process composed of three stages: selection, execution, and verification. This strategy dynamically selects the most suitable decomposition approach based on task characteristics and enhances the reliability of the results through a verification module. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that the Select-Then-Decompose consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, demonstrating an optimal balance between performance and cost. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/summervvind/Select-Then-Decompose.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving remarkable performance in complex reasoning domains such as mathematics and code generation. However, current RL methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision. Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward (DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward (DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to learn from continuous experience.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods for automated toxicity detection in online gaming chats. Traditional machine learning models with embeddings, large language models (LLMs) with zero-shot and few-shot prompting, fine-tuned transformer models, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches are evaluated. The evaluation framework assesses three critical dimensions: classification accuracy, processing speed, and computational costs. A hybrid moderation system architecture is proposed that optimizes human moderator workload through automated detection and incorporates continuous learning mechanisms. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance variations across methods, with fine-tuned DistilBERT achieving optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. The findings provide empirical evidence for deploying cost-effective, efficient content moderation systems in dynamic online gaming environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code-related tasks but often struggle in realistic software repositories, where project-specific APIs and cross-file dependencies are crucial. Retrieval-augmented methods mitigate this by injecting repository context at inference time. The low inference-time latency budget affects either retrieval quality or the added latency adversely impacts user experience. We address this limitation with SpecAgent, an agent that improves both latency and code-generation quality by proactively exploring repository files during indexing and constructing speculative context that anticipates future edits in each file. This indexing-time asynchrony allows thorough context computation, masking latency, and the speculative nature of the context improves code-generation quality. Additionally, we identify the problem of future context leakage in existing benchmarks, which can inflate reported performance. To address this, we construct a synthetic, leakage-free benchmark that enables a more realistic evaluation of our agent against baselines. Experiments show that SpecAgent consistently achieves absolute gains of 9-11% (48-58% relative) compared to the best-performing baselines, while significantly reducing inference latency.

Abstract: Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math, coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled, universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust generalization of our framework.

Abstract: Extending Named Entity Recognition (NER) models to new PII entities in noisy spoken-language data is a common need. We find that jointly fine-tuning a BERT model on standard semantic entities (PER, LOC, ORG) and new pattern-based PII (EMAIL, PHONE) results in minimal degradation for original classes. We investigate this "peaceful coexistence," hypothesizing that the model uses independent semantic vs. morphological feature mechanisms.
  Using an incremental learning setup as a diagnostic tool, we measure semantic drift and find two key insights. First, the LOC (location) entity is uniquely vulnerable due to a representation overlap with new PII, as it shares pattern-like features (e.g., postal codes). Second, we identify a "reverse O-tag representation drift." The model, initially trained to map PII patterns to 'O', blocks new learning. This is resolved only by unfreezing the 'O' tag's classifier, allowing the background class to adapt and "release" these patterns. This work provides a mechanistic diagnosis of NER model adaptation, highlighting feature independence, representation overlap, and 'O' tag plasticity.

Abstract: Unlike other military technologies driven by national security needs and developed with federal funding, AI is predominantly funded and advanced by commercial industry for civilian applications. However, there is a lack of understanding of the reasons commercial AI firms decide to work with the DoD or choose to abstain from the defence market. This thesis argues that the contract law and procurement framework are among the most significant obstacles. This research indicates that the commercial AI industry actually views the DoD as an attractive customer. However, this attraction is despite the obstacles presented by traditional contract law and procurement practices used to solicit and award contracts. Drawing on social exchange theory, this thesis introduces a theoretical framework, optimal buyer theory, to understand the factors that influence a commercial decision to engage with the DoD. Interviews from a sample of the participants explain why the AI industry holds such perceptions, opinions, and preferences about contracts generally and the DoD, specifically, in its role as a customer. This thesis concludes that commercial AI firms are attracted to contracts that are consistent with their business and technology considerations. Additionally, it develops best practices for leveraging existing contract law, primarily other transaction authority, to align contracting practices with commercial preferences and the machine learning development and deployment lifecycle.

Abstract: We introduce Chart2Code, a new benchmark for evaluating the chart understanding and code generation capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). Chart2Code is explicitly designed from a user-driven perspective, capturing diverse real-world scenarios and progressively increasing task difficulty. It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction) reproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart Editing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding elements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to transform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user instructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that reflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task complexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 2,023 tasks across 22 chart types, paired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness and the visual fidelity of rendered charts. We benchmark 25 state-of-the-art (SoTA) LMMs, including both proprietary and the latest open-source models such as GPT-5, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3/3.5, MiMo-VL, and Seed-1.6-VL. Experimental results demonstrate that even the SoTA model GPT-5 averages only 0.57 on code-based evaluation and 0.22 on chart-quality assessment across the editing tasks, underscoring the difficulty of Chart2Code. We anticipate this benchmark will drive advances in multimodal reasoning and foster the development of more robust and general-purpose LMMs. Our code and data are available on Chart2Code.

Abstract: Detecting regime shifts in chaotic time series is hard because observation-space signals are entangled with intrinsic variability. We propose Parameter--Space Changepoint Detection (Param--CPD), a two--stage framework that first amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters with a neural posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, and then applies a standard CPD algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory. On Lorenz--63 with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a cleaner detection signal. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length, and noise indicate consistent gains. Our results show that operating in a physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown some success in augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, as a non-parametric knowledge integration paradigm for LLMs, RAG methods heavily rely on external retrieval modules and the retrieved textual context prior. Especially for very large scale knowledge augmentation, they would introduce substantial inference latency due to expensive searches and much longer relevant context. In this paper, we propose a parametric knowledge integration method, called \textbf{AtlasKV}, a scalable, effective, and general way to augment LLMs with billion-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) (e.g. 1B triples) using very little GPU memory cost (e.g. less than 20GB VRAM). In AtlasKV, we introduce KG2KV and HiKVP to integrate KG triples into LLMs at scale with sub-linear time and memory complexity. It maintains strong knowledge grounding and generalization performance using the LLMs' inherent attention mechanism, and requires no external retrievers, long context priors, or retraining when adapting to new knowledge.

While recent deep learning models have made breakthroughs in solving the crystallographic phase problem, the resulting low-resolution electron density maps are often ambiguous and difficult to interpret. To overcome this critical bottleneck, we introduce XDXD, to our knowledge, the first end-to-end deep learning framework to determine a complete atomic model directly from low-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. Our diffusion-based generative model bypasses the need for manual map interpretation, producing chemically plausible crystal structures conditioned on the diffraction pattern. We demonstrate that XDXD achieves a 70.4\% match rate for structures with data limited to 2.0~\AA{} resolution, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) below 0.05. Evaluated on a benchmark of 24,000 experimental structures, our model proves to be robust and accurate. Furthermore, a case study on small peptides highlights the model's potential for extension to more complex systems, paving the way for automated structure solution in previously intractable cases.

Abstract: AI is transforming medical practice and redefining the competencies that future healthcare professionals need to master. Despite international recommendations, the integration of AI into Medicine curricula in Spain had not been systematically evaluated until now. A cross-sectional study (July-September 2025) including Spanish universities offering the official degree in Medicine, according to the 'Register of Universities, Centers and Degrees (Registro de Universidades, Centros y T\'itulos RUCT)'. Curricula and publicly available institutional documentation were reviewed to identify courses and competencies related to AI in the 2025-2026 academic year. The analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. Of the 52 universities analyzed, ten (19.2%) offer specific AI courses, whereas 36 (69.2%) include no related content. Most of the identified courses are elective, with a credit load ranging from three to six ECTS, representing on average 1.17% of the total 360 credits of the degree. The University of Ja\'en is the only institution offering a compulsory course with AI content. The territorial analysis reveals marked disparities: Andalusia leads with 55.5% of its universities incorporating AI training, while several communities lack any initiative in this area. The integration of AI into the medical degree in Spain is incipient, fragmented, and uneven, with a low weight in ECTS. The limited training load and predominance of elective courses restrict the preparation of future physicians to practice in a healthcare environment increasingly mediated by AI. The findings support the establishment of minimum standards and national monitoring of indicators.

<title>Believe It or Not: How Deeply do LLMs Believe Implanted Facts?</title>

Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques promise to implant new factual knowledge into large language models (LLMs). But do LLMs really believe these facts? We develop a framework to measure belief depth and use it to evaluate the success of knowledge editing techniques. We operationalize belief depth as the extent to which implanted knowledge 1) generalizes to related contexts (e.g. Fermi estimates several logical steps removed), 2) is robust to self-scrutiny and direct challenge, and 3) is represented similarly to genuine knowledge (as measured by linear probes). Our evaluations show that simple prompting and mechanistic editing techniques fail to implant knowledge deeply. In contrast, Synthetic Document Finetuning (SDF) - where models are trained on LLM-generated documents consistent with a fact - often succeeds at implanting beliefs that behave similarly to genuine knowledge. However, SDF's success is not universal, as implanted beliefs that contradict basic world knowledge are brittle and representationally distinct from genuine knowledge. Overall, our work introduces measurable criteria for belief depth and enables the rigorous evaluation necessary for deploying knowledge editing in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained machine learning models have reshaped our understanding of artificial intelligence across numerous domains, including our own field of geography. As with any new technology, trust has taken on an important role in this discussion. In this chapter, we examine the multifaceted concept of trust in foundation models, particularly within a geographic context. As reliance on these models increases and they become relied upon for critical decision-making, trust, while essential, has become a fractured concept. Here we categorize trust into three types: epistemic trust in the training data, operational trust in the model's functionality, and interpersonal trust in the model developers. Each type of trust brings with it unique implications for geographic applications. Topics such as cultural context, data heterogeneity, and spatial relationships are fundamental to the spatial sciences and play an important role in developing trust. The chapter continues with a discussion of the challenges posed by different forms of biases, the importance of transparency and explainability, and ethical responsibilities in model development. Finally, the novel perspective of geographic information scientists is emphasized with a call for further transparency, bias mitigation, and regionally-informed policies. Simply put, this chapter aims to provide a conceptual starting point for researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers to better understand trust in (generative) GeoAI.

<title>Intuitionistic $j$-Do-Calculus in Topos Causal Models</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we generalize Pearl's do-calculus to an Intuitionistic setting called $j$-stable causal inference inside a topos of sheaves. Our framework is an elaboration of the recently proposed framework of Topos Causal Models (TCMs), where causal interventions are defined as subobjects. We generalize the original setting of TCM using the Lawvere-Tierney topology on a topos, defined by a modal operator $j$ on the subobject classifier $\Omega$. We introduce $j$-do-calculus, where we replace global truth with local truth defined by Kripke-Joyal semantics, and formalize causal reasoning as structure-preserving morphisms that are stable along $j$-covers. $j$-do-calculus is a sound rule system whose premises and conclusions are formulas of the internal Intuitionistic logic of the causal topos. We define $j$-stability for conditional independences and interventional claims as local truth in the internal logic of the causal topos. We give three inference rules that mirror Pearl's insertion/deletion and action/observation exchange, and we prove soundness in the Kripke-Joyal semantics. A companion paper in preparation will describe how to estimate the required entities from data and instantiate $j$-do with standard discovery procedures (e.g., score-based and constraint-based methods), and will include experimental results on how to (i) form data-driven $j$-covers (via regime/section constructions), (ii) compute chartwise conditional independences after graph surgeries, and (iii) glue them to certify the premises of the $j$-do rules in practice

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are improving at an exceptional rate. With the advent of agentic workflows, multi-turn dialogue has become the de facto mode of interaction with LLMs for completing long and complex tasks. While LLM capabilities continue to improve, they remain increasingly susceptible to jailbreaking, especially in multi-turn scenarios where harmful intent can be subtly injected across the conversation to produce nefarious outcomes. While single-turn attacks have been extensively explored, adaptability, efficiency and effectiveness continue to remain key challenges for their multi-turn counterparts. To address these gaps, we present PLAGUE, a novel plug-and-play framework for designing multi-turn attacks inspired by lifelong-learning agents. PLAGUE dissects the lifetime of a multi-turn attack into three carefully designed phases (Primer, Planner and Finisher) that enable a systematic and information-rich exploration of the multi-turn attack family. Evaluations show that red-teaming agents designed using PLAGUE achieve state-of-the-art jailbreaking results, improving attack success rates (ASR) by more than 30% across leading models in a lesser or comparable query budget. Particularly, PLAGUE enables an ASR (based on StrongReject) of 81.4% on OpenAI's o3 and 67.3% on Claude's Opus 4.1, two models that are considered highly resistant to jailbreaks in safety literature. Our work offers tools and insights to understand the importance of plan initialization, context optimization and lifelong learning in crafting multi-turn attacks for a comprehensive model vulnerability evaluation.

Abstract: We advance the understanding of robotic intervention in high-risk scenarios by examining their potential to distract and impede a school shooter. To evaluate this concept, we conducted a virtual reality study with 150 university participants role-playing as a school shooter. Within the simulation, an autonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself strategically to interfere and distract. The strategy the robot used to approach the shooter was manipulated -- either moving directly in front of the shooter (aggressive) or maintaining distance (passive) -- and the distraction method, ranging from no additional cues (low), to siren and lights (medium), to siren, lights, and smoke to impair visibility (high). An aggressive, high-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% relative to a no-robot control. This outcome underscores both the potential of robotic intervention to enhance safety and the pressing ethical questions surrounding their use in school environments.

Abstract: Sequential scientific data span many resolutions and domains, and unifying them into a common representation is a key step toward developing foundation models for the sciences. Astronomical spectra exemplify this challenge: massive surveys have collected millions of spectra across a wide range of wavelengths and resolutions, yet analyses remain fragmented across spectral domains (e.g., optical vs. infrared) and object types (e.g., stars vs. galaxies), limiting the ability to pool information across datasets. We present a deep learning model that jointly learns from heterogeneous spectra in a self-supervised manner. Our universal spectral tokenizer processes spectra from a variety of object types and resolutions directly on their native wavelength grids, producing intrinsically aligned, homogeneous, and physically meaningful representations that can be efficiently adapted to achieve competitive performance across a range of downstream tasks. For the first time, we demonstrate that a single model can unify spectral data across resolutions and domains, suggesting that our model can serve as a powerful building block for foundation models in astronomy -- and potentially extend to other scientific domains with heterogeneous sequential data, such as climate and healthcare.

Abstract: Modern language models are evaluated on large benchmarks, which are difficult to make sense of, especially for model selection. Looking at the raw evaluation numbers themselves using a model-centric lens, we propose SimBA, a three phase framework to Simplify Benchmark Analysis. The three phases of SimBA are: stalk, where we conduct dataset & model comparisons, prowl, where we discover a representative subset, and pounce, where we use the representative subset to predict performance on a held-out set of models. Applying SimBA to three popular LM benchmarks: HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite reveals that across all three benchmarks, datasets and models relate strongly to one another (stalk). We develop an representative set discovery algorithm which covers a benchmark using raw evaluation scores alone. Using our algorithm, we find that with 6.25% (1/16), 1.7% (1/58), and 28.4% (21/74) of the datasets for HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite respectively, we achieve coverage levels of at least 95% (prowl). Additionally, using just these representative subsets, we can both preserve model ranks and predict performance on a held-out set of models with near zero mean-squared error (pounce). Taken together, SimBA can help model developers improve efficiency during model training and dataset creators validate whether their newly created dataset differs from existing datasets in a benchmark. Our code is open source, available at https://github.com/nishantsubramani/simba.

Abstract: The convergence of LLM-powered research assistants and AI-based peer review systems creates a critical vulnerability: fully automated publication loops where AI-generated research is evaluated by AI reviewers without human oversight. We investigate this through \textbf{BadScientist}, a framework that evaluates whether fabrication-oriented paper generation agents can deceive multi-model LLM review systems. Our generator employs presentation-manipulation strategies requiring no real experiments. We develop a rigorous evaluation framework with formal error guarantees (concentration bounds and calibration analysis), calibrated on real data. Our results reveal systematic vulnerabilities: fabricated papers achieve acceptance rates up to . Critically, we identify \textit{concern-acceptance conflict} -- reviewers frequently flag integrity issues yet assign acceptance-level scores. Our mitigation strategies show only marginal improvements, with detection accuracy barely exceeding random chance. Despite provably sound aggregation mathematics, integrity checking systematically fails, exposing fundamental limitations in current AI-driven review systems and underscoring the urgent need for defense-in-depth safeguards in scientific publishing.

<title>Is Multilingual LLM Watermarking Truly Multilingual? A Simple Back-Translation Solution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Multilingual watermarking aims to make large language model (LLM) outputs traceable across languages, yet current methods still fall short. Despite claims of cross-lingual robustness, they are evaluated only on high-resource languages. We show that existing multilingual watermarking methods are not truly multilingual: they fail to remain robust under translation attacks in medium- and low-resource languages. We trace this failure to semantic clustering, which fails when the tokenizer vocabulary contains too few full-word tokens for a given language. To address this, we introduce STEAM, a back-translation-based detection method that restores watermark strength lost through translation. STEAM is compatible with any watermarking method, robust across different tokenizers and languages, non-invasive, and easily extendable to new languages. With average gains of +0.19 AUC and +40%p TPR@1% on 17 languages, STEAM provides a simple and robust path toward fairer watermarking across diverse languages.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has accelerated the long-standing goal of enabling natural language querying over complex, hybrid databases. Yet, this ambition exposes a dual challenge: reasoning jointly over structured, multi-relational schemas and the semantic content of linked unstructured assets. To overcome this, we present DynaQuery - a unified, self-adapting framework that serves as a practical blueprint for next-generation "Unbound Databases." At the heart of DynaQuery lies the Schema Introspection and Linking Engine (SILE), a novel systems primitive that elevates schema linking to a first-class query planning phase. We conduct a rigorous, multi-benchmark empirical evaluation of this structure-aware architecture against the prevalent unstructured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm. Our results demonstrate that the unstructured retrieval paradigm is architecturally susceptible to catastrophic contextual failures, such as SCHEMA_HALLUCINATION, leading to unreliable query generation. In contrast, our SILE-based design establishes a substantially more robust foundation, nearly eliminating this failure mode. Moreover, end-to-end validation on a complex, newly curated benchmark uncovers a key generalization principle: the transition from pure schema-awareness to holistic semantics-awareness. Taken together, our findings provide a validated architectural basis for developing natural language database interfaces that are robust, adaptable, and predictably consistent.

<title>From Local to Global: Revisiting Structured Pruning Paradigms for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Structured pruning is a practical approach to deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently, as it yields compact, hardware-friendly architectures. However, the dominant local paradigm is task-agnostic: by optimizing layer-wise reconstruction rather than task objectives, it tends to preserve perplexity or generic zero-shot behavior but fails to capitalize on modest task-specific calibration signals, often yielding limited downstream gains. We revisit global structured pruning and present GISP-Global Iterative Structured Pruning-a post-training method that removes attention heads and MLP channels using first-order, loss-based important weights aggregated at the structure level with block-wise normalization. An iterative schedule, rather than one-shot pruning, stabilizes accuracy at higher sparsity and mitigates perplexity collapse without requiring intermediate fine-tuning; the pruning trajectory also forms nested subnetworks that support a "prune-once, deploy-many" workflow. Furthermore, because importance is defined by a model-level loss, GISP naturally supports task-specific objectives; we instantiate perplexity for language modeling and a margin-based objective for decision-style tasks. Extensive experiments show that across Llama2-7B/13B, Llama3-8B, and Mistral-0.3-7B, GISP consistently lowers WikiText-2 perplexity and improves downstream accuracy, with especially strong gains at 40-50% sparsity; on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-3-8B with GSM8K, task-aligned calibration substantially boosts exact-match accuracy.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from input images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline: structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned 7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8% accuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly detection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic monitoring for autonomous systems.

Abstract: The red palm mite infestation has become a serious concern, particularly in regions with extensive palm cultivation, leading to reduced productivity and economic losses. Accurate and early identification of mite-infested plants is critical for effective management. The current study focuses on evaluating and comparing the ML model for classifying the affected plants and detecting the infestation. TriggerNet is a novel interpretable AI framework that integrates Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to generate novel visual explanations for deep learning models in plant classification and disease detection. This study applies TriggerNet to address red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestation, a major threat to palm cultivation and agricultural productivity. A diverse set of RGB images across 11 plant species, Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise, Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree, and Cast Iron Plant was utilized for training and evaluation. Advanced deep learning models like CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, alongside machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM, and KNN, were employed for plant classification. For disease classification, all plants were categorized into four classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish Bronzing, and Silk Webbing. Snorkel was used to efficiently label these disease classes by leveraging heuristic rules and patterns, reducing manual annotation time and improving dataset reliability.

Abstract: Forecasting unobservable physical quantities from sparse, cross-domain sensor data is a central unsolved problem in scientific machine learning. Existing neural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located input-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical manifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator Network (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable functional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron measurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond shared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and target manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without iterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator learning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23 years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with millisecond inference latency. The framework establishes a general principle for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at capturing latent semantics and contextual relationships across diverse modalities. However, in modeling user behavior from sequential interaction data, performance often suffers when such semantic context is limited or absent. We introduce LaMAR, a LLM-driven semantic enrichment framework designed to enrich such sequences automatically. LaMAR leverages LLMs in a few-shot setting to generate auxiliary contextual signals by inferring latent semantic aspects of a user's intent and item relationships from existing metadata. These generated signals, such as inferred usage scenarios, item intents, or thematic summaries, augment the original sequences with greater contextual depth. We demonstrate the utility of this generated resource by integrating it into benchmark sequential modeling tasks, where it consistently improves performance. Further analysis shows that LLM-generated signals exhibit high semantic novelty and diversity, enhancing the representational capacity of the downstream models. This work represents a new data-centric paradigm where LLMs serve as intelligent context generators, contributing a new method for the semi-automatic creation of training data and language resources.

Abstract: Causal representation learning in the anti-causal setting (labels cause features rather than the reverse) presents unique challenges requiring specialized approaches. We propose Anti-Causal Invariant Abstractions (ACIA), a novel measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning. ACIA employs a two-level design, low-level representations capture how labels generate observations, while high-level representations learn stable causal patterns across environment-specific variations. ACIA addresses key limitations of existing approaches by accommodating prefect and imperfect interventions through interventional kernels, eliminating dependency on explicit causal structures, handling high-dimensional data effectively, and providing theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ACIA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and invariance metrics. Furthermore, our theoretical results establish tight bounds on performance gaps between training and unseen environments, confirming the efficacy of our approach for robust anti-causal learning.

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning fine-tuning of generative models presents a critical challenge, as existing approaches rely on fixed divergence regularization that creates an inherent dilemma: strong regularization preserves model capabilities but limits reward optimization, while weak regularization enables greater alignment but risks instability or reward hacking. We introduce Adaptive Divergence Regularized Policy Optimization (ADRPO), which automatically adjusts regularization strength based on advantage estimates-reducing regularization for high-value samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples, enabling policies to navigate between exploration and aggressive exploitation according to data quality. Our implementation with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow matching generative models achieves remarkable results on text-to-image generation, achieving better semantic alignment and diversity than offline methods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization like ORW-CFM-W2. ADRPO enables a 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass much larger models with 4.8B and 12B parameters in attribute binding, semantic consistency, artistic style transfer, and compositional control while maintaining generation diversity. ADRPO generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of both text-only LLMs and multi-modal reasoning models, enhancing existing online RL methods like GRPO. In LLM fine-tuning, ADRPO demonstrates an emergent ability to escape local optima through active exploration, while in multi-modal audio reasoning, it outperforms GRPO through superior step-by-step reasoning, enabling a 7B model to outperform substantially larger commercial models including Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, offering an effective plug-and-play solution to the exploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and modalities.

Abstract: Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires not only safety and efficiency, but also realistic, human-like behaviors that are socially aware and predictable. Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like, fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm for testing autonomous driving policies.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image generation, yet fine-tuning them with intermediate feedback remains challenging, especially for continuous-time flow matching models. Most existing approaches solely learn from outcome rewards, struggling with the credit assignment problem. Alternative methods that attempt to learn a critic via direct regression on cumulative rewards often face training instabilities and model collapse in online settings. We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1) reward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable intermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability mechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy updates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before influencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme that extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model diversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human preference models. Our results demonstrate that even with a computationally efficient critic model, we can robustly finetune flow models without compromising generative quality, diversity, or stability.

<title>R2L: Reliable Reinforcement Learning: Guaranteed Return &amp; Reliable Policies in Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of determining reliable policies in reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on optimization under uncertainty and the need for performance guarantees. While classical RL algorithms aim at maximizing the expected return, many real-world applications - such as routing, resource allocation, or sequential decision-making under risk - require strategies that ensure not only high average performance but also a guaranteed probability of success. To this end, we propose a novel formulation in which the objective is to maximize the probability that the cumulative return exceeds a prescribed threshold. We demonstrate that this reliable RL problem can be reformulated, via a state-augmented representation, into a standard RL problem, thereby allowing the use of existing RL and deep RL algorithms without the need for entirely new algorithmic frameworks. Theoretical results establish the equivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be derived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or Dueling Double DQN. To illustrate the practical relevance of the approach, we consider the problem of reliable routing, where the goal is not to minimize the expected travel time but rather to maximize the probability of reaching the destination within a given time budget. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed formulation leads to policies that effectively balance efficiency and reliability, highlighting the potential of reliable RL for applications in stochastic and safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning (benign or adversarial).

<title>RL-Driven Security-Aware Resource Allocation Framework for UAV-Assisted O-RAN</title>

Abstract: The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) into Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) enhances communication in disaster management and Search and Rescue (SAR) operations by ensuring connectivity when infrastructure fails. However, SAR scenarios demand stringent security and low-latency communication, as delays or breaches can compromise mission success. While UAVs serve as mobile relays, they introduce challenges in energy consumption and resource management, necessitating intelligent allocation strategies. Existing UAV-assisted O-RAN approaches often overlook the joint optimization of security, latency, and energy efficiency in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based framework for dynamic resource allocation in UAV relays, explicitly addressing these trade-offs. Our approach formulates an optimization problem that integrates security-aware resource allocation, latency minimization, and energy efficiency, which is solved using RL. Unlike heuristic or static methods, our framework adapts in real-time to network dynamics, ensuring robust communication. Simulations demonstrate superior performance compared to heuristic baselines, achieving enhanced security and energy efficiency while maintaining ultra-low latency in SAR scenarios.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a natural way for humans to teach robots, particularly when high-quality demonstrations are easy to obtain. While IL has been widely applied to single-robot settings, relatively few studies have addressed the extension of these methods to multi-agent systems, especially in settings where a single human must provide demonstrations to a team of collaborating robots. In this paper, we introduce and study Round-Robin Behavior Cloning (R2BC), a method that enables a single human operator to effectively train multi-robot systems through sequential, single-agent demonstrations. Our approach allows the human to teleoperate one agent at a time and incrementally teach multi-agent behavior to the entire system, without requiring demonstrations in the joint multi-agent action space. We show that R2BC methods match, and in some cases surpass, the performance of an oracle behavior cloning approach trained on privileged synchronized demonstrations across four multi-agent simulated tasks. Finally, we deploy R2BC on two physical robot tasks trained using real human demonstrations.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) partition input images into uniformly sized patches regardless of their content, resulting in long input sequence lengths for high-resolution images. We present Adaptive Patch Transformers (APT), which addresses this by using multiple different patch sizes within the same image. APT reduces the total number of input tokens by allocating larger patch sizes in more homogeneous areas and smaller patches in more complex ones. APT achieves a drastic speedup in ViT inference and training, increasing throughput by 40% on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining downstream performance, and can be applied to a previously fine-tuned ViT, converging in as little as 1 epoch. It also significantly reduces training and inference time without loss of performance in high-resolution dense visual tasks, achieving up to 30\% faster training and inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource allocation. This study develops and evaluates machine learning models that integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information, specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the MIMIC-IV database. We used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by a multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both models. Incorporating textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings significantly improved predictive performance. The final logistic regression model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an AUC of 0.918, compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%. The analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the clinical utility of the model. These results underscore the added prognostic value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.

Abstract: Recommender-systems research has accelerated model and evaluation advances, yet largely neglects automating the research process itself. We argue for a shift from narrow AutoRecSys tools -- focused on algorithm selection and hyper-parameter tuning -- to an Autonomous Recommender-Systems Research Lab (AutoRecLab) that integrates end-to-end automation: problem ideation, literature analysis, experimental design and execution, result interpretation, manuscript drafting, and provenance logging. Drawing on recent progress in automated science (e.g., multi-agent AI Scientist and AI Co-Scientist systems), we outline an agenda for the RecSys community: (1) build open AutoRecLab prototypes that combine LLM-driven ideation and reporting with automated experimentation; (2) establish benchmarks and competitions that evaluate agents on producing reproducible RecSys findings with minimal human input; (3) create review venues for transparently AI-generated submissions; (4) define standards for attribution and reproducibility via detailed research logs and metadata; and (5) foster interdisciplinary dialogue on ethics, governance, privacy, and fairness in autonomous research. Advancing this agenda can increase research throughput, surface non-obvious insights, and position RecSys to contribute to emerging Artificial Research Intelligence. We conclude with a call to organise a community retreat to coordinate next steps and co-author guidance for the responsible integration of automated research systems.

Abstract: We study discrete diffusion for language and other categorical data and focus on a common limitation of masked denoisers: reverse transitions typically factorize across positions, which can weaken joint structure and degrade quality in few-step generation. We propose \emph{Latent Discrete Diffusion Models} (LDDMs), which couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a continuous diffusion over latent embeddings. The latent channel provides a softer signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve ambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully joint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially resolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both variants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn informative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at lower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.

Abstract: Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency. Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks. In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline, which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall, language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32 critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy language-driven collaboration in transportation systems.

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving reliable and effective outputs from large language models (LLMs), but its design requires specialized knowledge of prompting techniques and a deep understanding of target tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that adaptively selects task-appropriate prompting techniques based on users' abstract task descriptions and automatically generates high-quality prompts without relying on pre-existing templates or frameworks. The proposed method constructs a knowledge base that associates task clusters, characterized by semantic similarity across diverse tasks, with their corresponding prompting techniques. When users input task descriptions, the system assigns them to the most relevant task cluster and dynamically generates prompts by integrating techniques drawn from the knowledge base. An experimental evaluation of the proposed method on 23 tasks from BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH) demonstrates superior performance compared with standard prompts and existing automatic prompt-generation tools, as measured by both arithmetic and harmonic mean scores. This research establishes a foundation for streamlining and standardizing prompt creation, enabling non-experts to effectively leverage LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text, but their internal reasoning remains opaque and difficult to control. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features that often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and passive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To address this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds explicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three stages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept representations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a dictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects activating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical reasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order structures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on multi-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept cues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA), and context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and context-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results demonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only improves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control, and alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and auditable AI.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in crowded scenes is challenging due to severe inter-person occlusions and highly dynamic, context-dependent motion patterns. Existing approaches often struggle to adapt to varying crowd densities and lack interpretable anomaly indicators. To address these limitations, we introduce VelocityNet, a dual-pipeline framework that combines head detection and dense optical flow to extract person-specific velocities. Hierarchical clustering categorizes these velocities into semantic motion classes (halt, slow, normal, and fast), and a percentile-based anomaly scoring system measures deviations from learned normal patterns. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns within densely crowded environments.

Abstract: Most current medical vision language models struggle to jointly generate diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks in response to complex visual questions. This represents a major limitation towards clinical application, as assistive systems that fail to provide both modalities simultaneously offer limited value to medical practitioners. To alleviate this limitation, we first introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a dataset combining abnormality detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation into a unified and hierarchical task. RadDiagSeg-D covers multiple imaging modalities and is precisely designed to support the development of models that produce descriptive text and corresponding segmentation masks in tandem. Subsequently, we leverage the dataset to propose a novel vision-language model, RadDiagSeg-M, capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation. RadDiagSeg-M provides highly informative and clinically useful outputs, effectively addressing the need to enrich contextual information for assistive diagnosis. Finally, we benchmark RadDiagSeg-M and showcase its strong performance across all components involved in the task of multi-target text-and-mask generation, establishing a robust and competitive baseline.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly used as evaluators in various applications, but the reliability of the outcomes remains a challenge. One such challenge is using LLMs-as-judges for direct assessment, i.e., assigning scores from a specified range without any references. We first show that this challenge stems from LLM judge outputs being associated with score range bias, i.e., LLM judge outputs are highly sensitive to pre-defined score ranges, preventing the search for optimal score ranges. We also show that similar biases exist among models from the same family. We then mitigate this bias through contrastive decoding, achieving up to 11.3% relative improvement on average in Spearman correlation with human judgments across different score ranges.

Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns. Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories. Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to 53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language safety.

Abstract: We explore how physical scale and population size shape the emergence of complex behaviors in open-ended ecological environments. In our setting, agents are unsupervised and have no explicit rewards or learning objectives but instead evolve over time according to reproduction, mutation, and natural selection. As they act, agents also shape their environment and the population around them in an ongoing dynamic ecology. Our goal is not to optimize a single high-performance policy, but instead to examine how behaviors emerge and evolve across large populations due to natural competition and environmental pressures. In an effort to discover how complex behaviors naturally emerge, we conduct experiments in large-scale worlds that reach populations of more than 60,000 individual agents, each with their own evolved neural network policy. We identify various emergent behaviors such as long-range resource extraction, vision-based foraging, and predation that arise under competitive and survival pressures. We examine how sensing modalities and environmental scale affect the emergence of these behaviors, finding that some appear only in sufficiently large environments and populations, with larger scales increasing behavioral stability and consistency. While there is a rich history of research in evolutionary settings, our scaling results provide promising new directions to explore ecology as an instrument of machine learning in an era of abundant computational resources.

Abstract: Mixed Reality (MR)-aided operation overlays digital objects on the physical world to provide a more immersive and intuitive operation process. A primary challenge is the precise and fast auto-verification of whether the user follows MR guidance by comparing frames before and after each operation. The pre-operation frame includes virtual guiding objects, while the post-operation frame contains physical counterparts. Existing approaches fall short of accounting for the discrepancies between physical and virtual objects due to imperfect 3D modeling or lighting estimation. In this paper, we propose EVER: an edge-assisted auto-verification system for mobile MR-aided operations. Unlike traditional frame-based similarity comparisons, EVER leverages the segmentation model and rendering pipeline adapted to the unique attributes of frames with physical pieces and those with their virtual counterparts; it adopts a threshold-based strategy using Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics for accurate auto-verification. To ensure fast auto-verification and low energy consumption, EVER offloads compute-intensive tasks to an edge server. Through comprehensive evaluations of public datasets and custom datasets with practical implementation, EVER achieves over 90% verification accuracy within 100 milliseconds (significantly faster than average human reaction time of approximately 273 milliseconds), while consuming only minimal additional computational resources and energy compared to a system without auto-verification.

Abstract: Scaling the number of parameters and the size of training data has proven to be an effective strategy for improving large language model (LLM) performance. Yet, as these models grow increasingly powerful and widely deployed, the cost of inference has become a pressing concern. Despite its importance, the trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency remains underexplored. In this work, we examine how key architectural factors, hidden size, the allocation of parameters between MLP and attention (mlp-to-attention ratio), and grouped-query attention (GQA), influence both inference cost and accuracy. We introduce a conditional scaling law that augments the Chinchilla framework with architectural information, along with a search framework for identifying architectures that are simultaneously inference-efficient and accurate. To validate our approach, we train more than 200 models spanning 80M to 3B parameters and 8B to 100B training tokens, and fit the proposed conditional scaling law. Our results show that the conditional scaling law reliably predicts optimal architectural choices and that the resulting models outperform existing open-source baselines. Under the same training budget, optimized architectures achieve up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater inference throughput compared to LLaMA-3.2.

<title>Finding the Sweet Spot: Optimal Data Augmentation Ratio for Imbalanced Credit Scoring Using ADASYN</title>

Abstract: Credit scoring models face a critical challenge: severe class imbalance, with default rates typically below 10%, which hampers model learning and predictive performance. While synthetic data augmentation techniques such as SMOTE and ADASYN have been proposed to address this issue, the optimal augmentation ratio remains unclear, with practitioners often defaulting to full balancing (1:1 ratio) without empirical justification.
  This study systematically evaluates 10 data augmentation scenarios using the Give Me Some Credit dataset (97,243 observations, 7% default rate), comparing SMOTE, BorderlineSMOTE, and ADASYN at different multiplication factors (1x, 2x, 3x). All models were trained using XGBoost and evaluated on a held-out test set of 29,173 real observations. Statistical significance was assessed using bootstrap testing with 1,000 iterations.
  Key findings reveal that ADASYN with 1x multiplication (doubling the minority class) achieved optimal performance with AUC of 0.6778 and Gini coefficient of 0.3557, representing statistically significant improvements of +0.77% and +3.00% respectively (p = 0.017, bootstrap test). Higher multiplication factors (2x and 3x) resulted in performance degradation, with 3x showing a -0.48% decrease in AUC, suggesting a "law of diminishing returns" for synthetic oversampling. The optimal class imbalance ratio was found to be 6.6:1 (majority:minority), contradicting the common practice of balancing to 1:1.
  This work provides the first empirical evidence of an optimal "sweet spot" for data augmentation in credit scoring, with practical guidelines for industry practitioners and researchers working with imbalanced datasets. While demonstrated on a single representative dataset, the methodology provides a reproducible framework for determining optimal augmentation ratios in other imbalanced domains.

Abstract: 3D human meshes show a natural hierarchical structure (like torso-limbs-fingers). But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior. In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets (especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features. Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Prompt Optimization has emerged as a crucial approach due to its capabilities in steering Large Language Models to solve various tasks. However, current works mainly rely on the random rewriting ability of LLMs, and the optimization process generally focus on specific influencing factors, which makes it easy to fall into local optimum. Besides, the performance of the optimized prompt is often unstable, which limits its transferability in different tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose $\textbf{DelvePO}$ ($\textbf{D}$irection-Guid$\textbf{e}$d Se$\textbf{l}$f-E$\textbf{v}$olving Framework for Fl$\textbf{e}$xible $\textbf{P}$rompt $\textbf{O}$ptimization), a task-agnostic framework to optimize prompts in self-evolve manner. In our framework, we decouple prompts into different components that can be used to explore the impact that different factors may have on various tasks. On this basis, we introduce working memory, through which LLMs can alleviate the deficiencies caused by their own uncertainties and further obtain key insights to guide the generation of new prompts. Extensive experiments conducted on different tasks covering various domains for both open- and closed-source LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini. Experimental results show that DelvePO consistently outperforms previous SOTA methods under identical experimental settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and transferability across different tasks.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables a single model to learn multiple tasks simultaneously, leveraging knowledge transfer among tasks for enhanced generalization, and has been widely applied across various domains. However, task imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the convergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this issue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training dynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL system. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method, NTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt spectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby mitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared representation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks, including both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task reinforcement learning.

Abstract: The use of low-bit quantization has emerged as an indispensable technique for enabling the efficient training of large-scale models. Despite its widespread empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its impact on learning performance remains notably absent, even in the simplest linear regression setting. We present the first systematic theoretical study of this fundamental question, analyzing finite-step stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for high-dimensional linear regression under a comprehensive range of quantization targets: data, labels, parameters, activations, and gradients. Our novel analytical framework establishes precise algorithm-dependent and data-dependent excess risk bounds that characterize how different quantization affects learning: parameter, activation, and gradient quantization amplify noise during training; data quantization distorts the data spectrum; and data and label quantization introduce additional approximation and quantized error. Crucially, we prove that for multiplicative quantization (with input-dependent quantization step), this spectral distortion can be eliminated, and for additive quantization (with constant quantization step), a beneficial scaling effect with batch size emerges. Furthermore, for common polynomial-decay data spectra, we quantitatively compare the risks of multiplicative and additive quantization, drawing a parallel to the comparison between FP and integer quantization methods. Our theory provides a powerful lens to characterize how quantization shapes the learning dynamics of optimization algorithms, paving the way to further explore learning theory under practical hardware constraints.

Abstract: We introduce the Stable Physics-Informed Kernel Evolution (SPIKE) method for numerical computation of inviscid hyperbolic conservation laws. SPIKE resolves a fundamental paradox: how strong-form residual minimization can capture weak solutions containing discontinuities. SPIKE employs reproducing kernel representations with regularized parameter evolution, where Tikhonov regularization provides a smooth transition mechanism through shock formation, allowing the dynamics to traverse shock singularities. This approach automatically maintains conservation, tracks characteristics, and captures shocks satisfying Rankine-Hugoniot conditions within a unified framework requiring no explicit shock detection or artificial viscosity. Numerical validation across scalar and vector-valued conservation laws confirms the method's effectiveness.

<title>Latent-Info and Low-Dimensional Learning for Human Mesh Recovery and Parallel Optimization</title>

Abstract: Existing 3D human mesh recovery methods often fail to fully exploit the latent information (e.g., human motion, shape alignment), leading to issues with limb misalignment and insufficient local details in the reconstructed human mesh (especially in complex scenes). Furthermore, the performance improvement gained by modelling mesh vertices and pose node interactions using attention mechanisms comes at a high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage network for human mesh recovery based on latent information and low dimensional learning. Specifically, the first stage of the network fully excavates global (e.g., the overall shape alignment) and local (e.g., textures, detail) information from the low and high-frequency components of image features and aggregates this information into a hybrid latent frequency domain feature. This strategy effectively extracts latent information. Subsequently, utilizing extracted hybrid latent frequency domain features collaborates to enhance 2D poses to 3D learning. In the second stage, with the assistance of hybrid latent features, we model the interaction learning between the rough 3D human mesh template and the 3D pose, optimizing the pose and shape of the human mesh. Unlike existing mesh pose interaction methods, we design a low-dimensional mesh pose interaction method through dimensionality reduction and parallel optimization that significantly reduces computational costs without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority compared to the most state-of-the-art.

<title>StreamingTOM: Streaming Token Compression for Efficient Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in 4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them, keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$ lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS. These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants can now process visual inputs, including images of text. This raises an intriguing question: can we compress textual inputs by feeding them as images to reduce token usage while preserving performance? In this paper, we show that visual text representations are a practical and surprisingly effective form of input compression for decoder LLMs. We exploit the idea of rendering long text inputs as a single image and provide it directly to the model. This leads to dramatically reduced number of decoder tokens required, offering a new form of input compression. Through experiments on two distinct benchmarks RULER (long-context retrieval) and CNN/DailyMail (document summarization) we demonstrate that this text-as-image method yields substantial token savings (often nearly half) without degrading task performance.

<title>From Retrieval to Generation: Unifying External and Parametric Knowledge for Medical Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Medical question answering (QA) requires extensive access to domain-specific knowledge. A promising direction is to enhance large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieved from medical corpora or parametric knowledge stored in model parameters. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grounds model reasoning on externally retrieved evidence, and Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG), which depends solely on the models internal knowledge to generate contextual documents. However, RAG often suffers from noisy or incomplete retrieval, while GAG is vulnerable to hallucinated or inaccurate information due to unconstrained generation. Both issues can mislead reasoning and undermine answer reliability. To address these challenges, we propose MedRGAG, a unified retrieval-generation augmented framework that seamlessly integrates external and parametric knowledge for medical QA. MedRGAG comprises two key modules: Knowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC), which directs the generator to produce background documents that complement the missing knowledge revealed by retrieval; and Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS), which adaptively selects an optimal combination of retrieved and generated documents to form concise yet comprehensive evidence for answer generation. Extensive experiments on five medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that MedRGAG achieves a 12.5% improvement over MedRAG and a 4.5% gain over MedGENIE, highlighting the effectiveness of unifying retrieval and generation for knowledge-intensive reasoning. Our code and data are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MedRGAG

Abstract: We investigate how embedding dimension affects the emergence of an internal "world model" in a transformer trained with reinforcement learning to perform bubble-sort-style adjacent swaps. Models achieve high accuracy even with very small embedding dimensions, but larger dimensions yield more faithful, consistent, and robust internal representations. In particular, higher embedding dimensions strengthen the formation of structured internal representation and lead to better interpretability. After hundreds of experiments, we observe two consistent mechanisms: (1) the last row of the attention weight matrix monotonically encodes the global ordering of tokens; and (2) the selected transposition aligns with the largest adjacent difference of these encoded values. Our results provide quantitative evidence that transformers build structured internal world models and that model size improves representation quality in addition to end performance. We release our metrics and analyses, which can be used to probe similar algorithmic tasks.

Abstract: Imitation learning from large-scale, diverse human demonstrations has proven effective for training robots, but collecting such data is costly and time-consuming. This challenge is amplified for multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation, where humans must teleoperate both a mobile base and two high-degree-of-freedom arms. Prior automated data generation frameworks have addressed static bimanual manipulation by augmenting a few human demonstrations in simulation, but they fall short for mobile settings due to two key challenges: (1) determining base placement to ensure reachability, and (2) positioning the camera to provide sufficient visibility for visuomotor policies. To address these issues, we introduce MoMaGen, which formulates data generation as a constrained optimization problem that enforces hard constraints (e.g., reachability) while balancing soft constraints (e.g., visibility during navigation). This formulation generalizes prior approaches and provides a principled foundation for future methods. We evaluate MoMaGen on four multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation tasks and show that it generates significantly more diverse datasets than existing methods. Leveraging this diversity, MoMaGen can train successful imitation learning policies from a single source demonstration, and these policies can be fine-tuned with as few as 40 real-world demonstrations to achieve deployment on physical robotic hardware. More details are available at our project page: momagen.github.io.

Abstract: We introduce Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM), a novel method for semi-supervised anomaly detection in tabular data. TCCM is inspired by flow matching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields between probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly applying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea -- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the framework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed target (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key advantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the need for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference; (2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which quantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward pass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models such as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy but heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as the learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly score inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical guarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench benchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on high-dimensional and large-scale datasets.

Abstract: State-of-the-art perceptive Reinforcement Learning controllers for legged robots either (i) impose oscillator or IK-based gait priors that constrain the action space, add bias to the policy optimization and reduce adaptability across robot morphologies, or (ii) operate "blind", which struggle to anticipate hind-leg terrain, and are brittle to noise. In this paper, we propose Phase-Guided Terrain Traversal (PGTT), a perception-aware deep-RL approach that overcomes these limitations by enforcing gait structure purely through reward shaping, thereby reducing inductive bias in policy learning compared to oscillator/IK-conditioned action priors. PGTT encodes per-leg phase as a cubic Hermite spline that adapts swing height to local heightmap statistics and adds a swing- phase contact penalty, while the policy acts directly in joint space supporting morphology-agnostic deployment. Trained in MuJoCo (MJX) on procedurally generated stair-like terrains with curriculum and domain randomization, PGTT achieves the highest success under push disturbances (median +7.5% vs. the next best method) and on discrete obstacles (+9%), with comparable velocity tracking, and converging to an effective policy roughly 2x faster than strong end-to-end baselines. We validate PGTT on a Unitree Go2 using a real-time LiDAR elevation-to-heightmap pipeline, and we report preliminary results on ANYmal-C obtained with the same hyperparameters. These findings indicate that terrain-adaptive, phase-guided reward shaping is a simple and general mechanism for robust perceptive locomotion across platforms.

Abstract: Adversarial pruning methods have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing neural networks while preserving robustness against adversarial attacks. These methods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model, (ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned model. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by assigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with the highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp local minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask selection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we introduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates during the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the corresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets, models, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes sharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately improving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.

Abstract: Distilling the tool-using capabilities of large language models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient small language models (SLMs) is a key challenge for their practical application. The predominant approach, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), suffers from poor generalization as it trains models to imitate a static set of teacher trajectories rather than learn a robust methodology. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers an alternative, the standard RL using sparse rewards fails to effectively guide SLMs, causing them to struggle with inefficient exploration and adopt suboptimal strategies. To address these distinct challenges, we propose MENTOR, a framework that synergistically combines RL with teacher-guided distillation. Instead of simple imitation, MENTOR employs an RL-based process to learn a more generalizable policy through exploration. In addition, to solve the problem of reward sparsity, it uses a teacher's reference trajectory to construct a dense, composite teacher-guided reward that provides fine-grained guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MENTOR significantly improves the cross-domain generalization and strategic competence of SLMs compared to both SFT and standard sparse-reward RL baselines.

Abstract: This paper presents an automated system for cricket video analysis that leverages deep learning techniques to extract wicket-taking deliveries, detect cricket balls, and model ball trajectories. The system employs the YOLOv8 architecture for pitch and ball detection, combined with optical character recognition (OCR) for scorecard extraction to identify wicket-taking moments. Through comprehensive image preprocessing, including grayscale transformation, power transformation, and morphological operations, the system achieves robust text extraction from video frames. The pitch detection model achieved 99.5% mean Average Precision at 50% IoU (mAP50) with a precision of 0.999, while the ball detection model using transfer learning attained 99.18% mAP50 with 0.968 precision and 0.978 recall. The system enables trajectory modeling on detected pitches, providing data-driven insights for identifying batting weaknesses. Experimental results on multiple cricket match videos demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for automated cricket analytics, offering significant potential for coaching and strategic decision-making.

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning often operates with coarse aggregate signals rather than instance labels. We study a setting where each training example is an $n$-tuple containing exactly m positives, while only the count m per tuple is observed. This NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision arises in, e.g., image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements. We show that tuple counts admit a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) by linking the tuple-generation process to latent instance marginals. Starting from fixed (n,m), we derive a closed-form URE and extend it to variable tuple sizes, variable counts, and their combination. Identification holds whenever the effective mixing rate is separated from the class prior. We establish generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity and prove statistical consistency with standard rates under mild regularity assumptions. To improve finite-sample stability, we introduce simple ReLU corrections to the URE that preserve asymptotic correctness. Across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, the approach consistently outperforms representative weak-supervision baselines and yields favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under class-prior imbalance and across diverse tuple configurations, demonstrating that count-only supervision can be exploited effectively through a theoretically grounded and practically stable objective.

Abstract: Open RAN introduces a flexible, cloud-based architecture for the Radio Access Network (RAN), enabling Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)-driven automation across heterogeneous, multi-vendor deployments. While EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) helps mitigate the opacity of AI models, explainability alone does not guarantee reliable network operations. In this article, we propose a lightweight verification approach based on interpretable models to validate the behavior of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents for RAN slicing and scheduling in Open RAN. Specifically, we use Decision Tree (DT)-based verifiers to perform near-real-time consistency checks at runtime, which would be otherwise unfeasible with computationally expensive state-of-the-art verifiers. We analyze the landscape of XAI and AI verification, propose a scalable architectural integration, and demonstrate feasibility with a DT-based slice-verifier. We also outline future challenges to ensure trustworthy AI adoption in Open RAN.

Abstract: The $\lambda$-superposition calculus is a successful approach to proving higher-order formulas. However, some parts of the calculus are extremely explosive, notably due to the higher-order unifier enumeration and the functional extensionality axiom. In the present work, we introduce an "optimistic" version of $\lambda$-superposition that addresses these two issues. Specifically, our new calculus delays explosive unification problems using constraints stored along with the clauses, and it applies functional extensionality in a more targeted way. The calculus is sound and refutationally complete with respect to a Henkin semantics. We have yet to implement it in a prover, but examples suggest that it will outperform, or at least usefully complement, the original $\lambda$-superposition calculus.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated that larger models often achieve superior performance. However, training these models remains computationally intensive and costly. To address this challenge, we introduce ScaleNet, an efficient approach for scaling ViT models. Unlike conventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion with negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained models. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs. Specifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers into pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain parameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a corresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential performance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set of adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are implemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of the shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific function. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet enables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\times$ depth-scaled DeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs, highlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs. Beyond image classification, our method shows significant potential for application in downstream vision areas, as evidenced by the validation in object detection task.

Abstract: We introduce ImageGem, a dataset for studying generative models that understand fine-grained individual preferences. We posit that a key challenge hindering the development of such a generative model is the lack of in-the-wild and fine-grained user preference annotations. Our dataset features real-world interaction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized LoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user preference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better preference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user preference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a vision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model recommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing customized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual user preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables, for the first time, a new paradigm for generative model personalization.

Abstract: Short video streaming has become a dominant paradigm in digital media, characterized by rapid swiping interactions and diverse media content. A key technical challenge is designing an effective preloading strategy that dynamically selects and prioritizes download tasks from an evolving playlist, balancing Quality of Experience (QoE) and bandwidth efficiency under practical commercial constraints. However, real world analysis reveals critical limitations of existing approaches: (1) insufficient adaptation of download task sizes to dynamic conditions, and (2) watch time prediction models that are difficult to deploy reliably at scale. In this paper, we propose DeLoad, a novel preloading framework that addresses these issues by introducing dynamic task sizing and a practical, multi dimensional watch time estimation method. Additionally, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enhanced agent is trained to optimize the download range decisions adaptively. Extensive evaluations conducted on an offline testing platform, leveraging massive real world network data, demonstrate that DeLoad achieves significant improvements in QoE metrics (34.4% to 87.4% gain). Furthermore, after deployment on a large scale commercial short video platform, DeLoad has increased overall user watch time by 0.09% while simultaneously reducing rebuffering events and 3.76% bandwidth consumption.

Abstract: Heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) are ubiquitous data structures in the real world. Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes, existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm, which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network (SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.

<title>CodeRL+: Improving Code Generation via Reinforcement with Execution Semantics Alignment</title>

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation by learning from vast code corpora, a fundamental semantic gap remains between their training on textual patterns and the goal of functional correctness, which is governed by formal execution semantics. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) approaches attempt to bridge this gap using outcome rewards from executing test cases. However, solely relying on binary pass/fail signals is inefficient for establishing a well-aligned connection between the textual representation of code and its execution semantics, especially for subtle logical errors within the code. In this paper, we propose CodeRL+, a novel approach that integrates execution semantics alignment into the RLVR training pipeline for code generation. CodeRL+ enables the model to infer variable-level execution trajectory, providing a direct learning signal of execution semantics. CodeRL+ can construct execution semantics alignment directly using existing on-policy rollouts and integrates seamlessly with various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeRL+ outperforms post-training baselines (including RLVR and Distillation), achieving a 4.6% average relative improvement in pass@1. CodeRL+ generalizes effectively to other coding tasks, yielding 15.5% and 4.4% higher accuracy on code-reasoning and test-output-generation benchmarks, respectively. CodeRL+ shows strong applicability across diverse RL algorithms and LLMs. Furthermore, probe analyses provide compelling evidence that CodeRL+ strengthens the alignment between code's textual representations and its underlying execution semantics.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data but often produce biased predictions with respect to sensitive attributes. Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii) the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Phone scams remain a pervasive threat to both personal safety and financial security worldwide. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in detecting fraudulent behavior by analyzing transcribed phone conversations. However, these capabilities introduce notable privacy risks, as such conversations frequently contain sensitive personal information that may be exposed to third-party service providers during processing. In this work, we explore how to harness LLMs for phone scam detection while preserving user privacy. We propose MASK (Modular Adaptive Sanitization Kit), a trainable and extensible framework that enables dynamic privacy adjustment based on individual preferences. MASK provides a pluggable architecture that accommodates diverse sanitization methods - from traditional keyword-based techniques for high-privacy users to sophisticated neural approaches for those prioritizing accuracy. We also discuss potential modeling approaches and loss function designs for future development, enabling the creation of truly personalized, privacy-aware LLM-based detection systems that balance user trust and detection effectiveness, even beyond phone scam context.

Abstract: Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is an important task in intelligent transportation systems, but existing approaches struggle to adapt to newly released models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city applications.

Abstract: LLMs are often used by downstream users as teacher models for knowledge distillation, compressing their capabilities into memory-efficient models. However, as these teacher models may stem from untrusted parties, distillation can raise unexpected security risks. In this paper, we investigate the security implications of knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher models. First, we show that prior backdoors mostly do not transfer onto student models. Our key insight is that this is because existing LLM backdooring methods choose trigger tokens that rarely occur in usual contexts. We argue that this underestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new backdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of transferable backdoors. T-MTB carefully constructs a composite backdoor trigger, made up of several specific tokens that often occur individually in anticipated distillation datasets. As such, the poisoned teacher remains stealthy, while during distillation the individual presence of these tokens provides enough signal for the backdoor to transfer onto the student. Using T-MTB, we demonstrate and extensively study the security risks of transferable backdoors across two attack scenarios, jailbreaking and content modulation, and across four model families of LLMs.

Abstract: Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the location of a specific object in an unseen environment. Embodied agents equipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation maps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily rely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to limited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which prevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt introduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency on local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device efficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better understand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to prune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we propose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to efficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on HM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time latency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner. Our code will be released soon.

Abstract: As AI systems enter high-stakes domains, evaluation must extend beyond predictive accuracy to include explainability, fairness, robustness, and sustainability. We introduce RAISE (Responsible AI Scoring and Evaluation), a unified framework that quantifies model performance across these four dimensions and aggregates them into a single, holistic Responsibility Score. We evaluated three deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Tabular ResNet, and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer, on structured datasets from finance, healthcare, and socioeconomics. Our findings reveal critical trade-offs: the MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, the Transformer excelled in explainability and fairness at a very high environmental cost, and the Tabular ResNet offered a balanced profile. These results underscore that no single model dominates across all responsibility criteria, highlighting the necessity of multi-dimensional evaluation for responsible model selection. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/raise-framework/raise.

Abstract: The paradigm of LLM-as-a-judge is emerging as a scalable and efficient alternative to human evaluation, demonstrating strong performance on well-defined tasks. However, its reliability in open-ended tasks with dynamic environments and complex interactions remains unexplored. To bridge the gap, we introduce WebDevJudge, a systematic benchmark for assessing LLM-as-a-judge performance in web development, with support for both non-interactive evaluation based on static observations and continuous interactive evaluation with a dynamic web environment. WebDevJudge comprises human preference labels over paired web implementations, annotated with structured and query-grounded rubrics to ensure high-quality ground truth. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate various evaluators, including LLMs, MLLMs, and agentic workflows. We systematically investigate the impact of different paradigms and guidance mechanisms. Our experiments reveal a significant gap between LLM judges and human experts. In-depth analysis indicates this gap stems from fundamental model limitations, including failures in recognizing functional equivalence, verifying task feasibility, and mitigating bias. Overall, WebDevJudge presents a significant challenge to LLM-as-a-judge, offering insights to guide future research toward developing more reliable and capable automated evaluators for complicated scenarios.

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a subject-to-video~(S2V) generation framework, which aims to synthesize subject-consistent videos conditioned on multiple reference images of target subjects. Despite recent progress in S2V generation models, existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances. In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline, incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V generation.

This paper examines the cost-benefit trade-off of interdisciplinary collaboration in AI mental health chatbots. We argue that involving experts from technology, healthcare, ethics, and law across key lifecycle phases is essential to ensure value-alignment and compliance with the high-risk requirements of the AI Act. We also highlight practical recommendations and existing frameworks to help balance the challenges and benefits of interdisciplinarity in mental health chatbots.

Abstract: Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge. Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g., VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available at https://github.com/zhangquanchen/3DThinker.

<title>C-SWAP: Explainability-Aware Structured Pruning for Efficient Neural Networks Compression</title>

Abstract: Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights, neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization. To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) images of biological samples remains a challenge in the life sciences. EM data captures details of biological structures, sometimes with such complexity that even human observers can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking, sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior, and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally, instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on 2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that {\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited amounts of training labels are available.

<title>Binary Quadratic Quantization: Beyond First-Order Quantization for Real-Valued Matrix Compression</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel matrix quantization method, Binary Quadratic Quantization (BQQ). In contrast to conventional first-order quantization approaches, such as uniform quantization and binary coding quantization, that approximate real-valued matrices via linear combinations of binary bases, BQQ leverages the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while maintaining an extremely compact data format. We validate our approach with two experiments: a matrix compression benchmark and post-training quantization (PTQ) on pretrained Vision Transformer-based models. Experimental results demonstrate that BQQ consistently achieves a superior trade-off between memory efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods for compressing diverse matrix data. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, even though we neither target state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy under tight memory constraints nor rely on PTQ-specific binary matrix optimization. For example, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2\% and 59.1% on the ImageNet dataset under the calibration-based and data-free scenarios, respectively, with quantization equivalent to 2 bits. These findings highlight the surprising effectiveness of binary quadratic expressions for efficient matrix approximation and neural network compression.

Abstract: The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in solving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to general LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1) significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference serving.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become progressively more embedded in clinical decision-support, documentation, and patient-information systems, ensuring their privacy and trustworthiness has emerged as an imperative challenge for the healthcare sector. Fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive electronic health record (EHR) data improves domain alignment but also raises the risk of exposing patient information through model behaviors. In this work-in-progress, we present an exploratory empirical study on membership inference vulnerabilities in clinical LLMs, focusing on whether adversaries can infer if specific patient records were used during model training. Using a state-of-the-art clinical question-answering model, Llemr, we evaluate both canonical loss-based attacks and a domain-motivated paraphrasing-based perturbation strategy that more realistically reflects clinical adversarial conditions. Our preliminary findings reveal limited but measurable membership leakage, suggesting that current clinical LLMs provide partial resistance yet remain susceptible to subtle privacy risks that could undermine trust in clinical AI adoption. These results motivate continued development of context-aware, domain-specific privacy evaluations and defenses such as differential privacy fine-tuning and paraphrase-aware training, to strengthen the security and trustworthiness of healthcare AI systems.

Abstract: Recent surges in LLM-driven intelligent systems largely overlook decades of foundational multi-agent systems (MAS) research, resulting in frameworks with critical limitations such as centralization and inadequate trust and communication protocols. This paper introduces the Fetch.ai architecture, an industrial-strength platform designed to bridge this gap by facilitating the integration of classical MAS principles with modern AI capabilities. We present a novel, multi-layered solution built on a decentralized foundation of on-chain blockchain services for verifiable identity, discovery, and transactions. This is complemented by a comprehensive development framework for creating secure, interoperable agents, a cloud-based platform for deployment, and an intelligent orchestration layer where an agent-native LLM translates high-level human goals into complex, multi-agent workflows. We demonstrate the deployed nature of this system through a decentralized logistics use case where autonomous agents dynamically discover, negotiate, and transact with one another securely. Ultimately, the Fetch.ai stack provides a principled architecture for moving beyond current agent implementations towards open, collaborative, and economically sustainable multi-agent ecosystems.

<title>Preference-based Reinforcement Learning beyond Pairwise Comparisons: Benefits of Multiple Options</title>

Abstract: We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024, Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}} \right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably, the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm, which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}} \right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.

Abstract: To mitigate unfair and unethical discrimination over sensitive features (e.g., gender, age, or race), fairness testing plays an integral role in engineering systems that leverage AI models to handle tabular data. A key challenge therein is how to effectively reveal fairness bugs under an intractable sample size using perturbation. Much current work has been focusing on designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about data characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting their full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing a generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT. Through causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most directly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive counterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a causal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide a test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves as a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators. Extensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably improve arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the cases with acceptable extra runtime overhead. Compared with a state-of-the-art approach that ranks the non-sensitive features solely based on correlation, CausalFT performs significantly better on 64% cases while being much more efficient. Further, CausalFT can better improve bias resilience in nearly all cases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreak attacks. We introduce HarmNet, a modular framework comprising ThoughtNet, a hierarchical semantic network; a feedback-driven Simulator for iterative query refinement; and a Network Traverser for real-time adaptive attack execution. HarmNet systematically explores and refines the adversarial space to uncover stealthy, high-success attack paths. Experiments across closed-source and open-source LLMs show that HarmNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher attack success rates. For example, on Mistral-7B, HarmNet achieves a 99.4% attack success rate, 13.9% higher than the best baseline. Index terms: jailbreak attacks; large language models; adversarial framework; query refinement.

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate strong capabilities in single-turn instruction following but suffer from Lost-in-Conversation (LiC), a degradation in performance as information is revealed progressively in multi-turn settings. Motivated by the current progress on Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), we propose Curriculum Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Accuracy and Abstention Rewards (RLAAR), a framework that encourages models not only to generate correct answers, but also to judge the solvability of questions in the multi-turn conversation setting. Our approach employs a competence-gated curriculum that incrementally increases dialogue difficulty (in terms of instruction shards), stabilizing training while promoting reliability. Using multi-turn, on-policy rollouts and a mixed-reward system, RLAAR teaches models to balance problem-solving with informed abstention, reducing premature answering behaviors that cause LiC. Evaluated on LiC benchmarks, RLAAR significantly mitigates LiC performance decay (62.6% to 75.1%) and improves calibrated abstention rates (33.5% to 73.4%). Together, these results provide a practical recipe for building multi-turn reliable and trustworthy LLMs.

<title>Computational Foundations for Strategic Coopetition: Formalizing Interdependence and Complementarity</title>

Abstract: Modern socio-technical systems are characterized by strategic coopetition where actors simultaneously cooperate to create value and compete to capture it. While conceptual modeling languages like i* provide rich qualitative representations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for quantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory offers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical report bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize two critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We ground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating depender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence coefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize complementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept, modeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We integrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation and introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates structural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental testing across power and logarithmic value function specifications, demonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the Samsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011), where logarithmic specifications achieve superior empirical fit (validation score 45/60) while power functions provide theoretical tractability. This technical report serves as the foundational reference for a coordinated research program examining strategic coopetition in requirements engineering and multi-agent systems, with companion work addressing trust dynamics, team production, and reciprocity mechanisms.

Abstract: We present a simple, self-help online supervised finetuning (OSFT) paradigm for LLM reasoning. In this paradigm, the model generates its own responses and is immediately finetuned on this self-generated data. OSFT is a highly efficient training strategy for LLM reasoning, as it is reward-free and uses just one rollout by default. Experiment results show that OSFT achieves downstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable to strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods such as GRPO. Our ablation study further demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of OSFT. The major mechanism of OSFT lies in facilitating the model's own existing preference (latent knowledge) learned from pretraining, which leads to reasoning ability improvement. We believe that OSFT offers an efficient and promising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms. Our code is available at https://github.com/ElementQi/OnlineSFT.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in specialized fields, such as industrial applications, due to their efficiency, lower computational requirements, and ability to be fine-tuned for domain-specific tasks, enabling accurate and cost-effective solutions. However, performing complex reasoning using SLMs in specialized fields such as Industry 4.0 remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation framework for industrial asset health, which transfers reasoning capabilities via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller, more efficient models (SLMs). We discuss the advantages and the process of distilling LLMs using multi-choice question answering (MCQA) prompts to enhance reasoning and refine decision-making. We also perform in-context learning to verify the quality of the generated knowledge and benchmark the performance of fine-tuned SLMs with generated knowledge against widely used LLMs. The results show that the fine-tuned SLMs with CoT reasoning outperform the base models by a significant margin, narrowing the gap to their LLM counterparts.

Abstract: Tuberculosis remains a critical global health issue, particularly in resource-limited and remote areas. Early detection is vital for treatment, yet the lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial intelligence (AI)-driven screening tools. Developing reliable AI models is challenging due to the necessity for large, high-quality datasets, which are costly to obtain. To tackle this, we propose a teacher--student framework which enhances both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays by integrating two supervised heads and a self-supervised head. Our model achieves an accuracy of 98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and a macro-F1 score of 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection, significantly outperforming baselines. The explainability assessments also show the model bases its predictions on relevant anatomical features, demonstrating promise for deployment in clinical screening and triage settings.

Abstract: Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values, and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning. We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor. Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization. We have released our code at https://github.com/USC-Lira/Q3C.

Abstract: Faithfully personalizing large language models (LLMs) to align with individual user preferences is a critical but challenging task. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) quickly reaches a performance plateau, standard reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) also struggles with the nuances of personalization. Scalar-based reward models are prone to reward hacking which leads to verbose and superficially personalized responses. To address these limitations, we propose Critique-Post-Edit, a robust reinforcement learning framework that enables more faithful and controllable personalization. Our framework integrates two key components: (1) a Personalized Generative Reward Model (GRM) that provides multi-dimensional scores and textual critiques to resist reward hacking, and (2) a Critique-Post-Edit mechanism where the policy model revises its own outputs based on these critiques for more targeted and efficient learning. Under a rigorous length-controlled evaluation, our method substantially outperforms standard PPO on personalization benchmarks. Personalized Qwen2.5-7B achieves an average 11\% win-rate improvement, and personalized Qwen2.5-14B model surpasses the performance of GPT-4.1. These results demonstrate a practical path to faithful, efficient, and controllable personalization.

Abstract: Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations. We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage, while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision. Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Lyapunov-Based Quantum Reinforcement Learning (LQRL) framework that integrates quantum policy optimization with Lyapunov stability analysis for continuous-time vehicle control. The proposed approach combines the representational power of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) with a stability-aware policy gradient mechanism to ensure asymptotic convergence and safe decision-making under dynamic environments. The vehicle longitudinal control problem was formulated as a continuous-state reinforcement learning task, where the quantum policy network generates control actions subject to Lyapunov stability constraints. Simulation experiments were conducted in a closed-loop adaptive cruise control scenario using a quantum-inspired policy trained under stability feedback. The results demonstrate that the LQRL framework successfully embeds Lyapunov stability verification into quantum policy learning, enabling interpretable and stability-aware control performance. Although transient overshoot and Lyapunov divergence were observed under aggressive acceleration, the system maintained bounded state evolution, validating the feasibility of integrating safety guarantees within quantum reinforcement learning architectures. The proposed framework provides a foundational step toward provably safe quantum control in autonomous systems and hybrid quantum-classical optimization domains.

Abstract: We present Ring-1T, the first open-source, state-of-the-art thinking model with a trillion-scale parameter. It features 1 trillion total parameters and activates approximately 50 billion per token. Training such models at a trillion-parameter scale introduces unprecedented challenges, including train-inference misalignment, inefficiencies in rollout processing, and bottlenecks in the RL system. To address these, we pioneer three interconnected innovations: (1) IcePop stabilizes RL training via token-level discrepancy masking and clipping, resolving instability from training-inference mismatches; (2) C3PO++ improves resource utilization for long rollouts under a token budget by dynamically partitioning them, thereby obtaining high time efficiency; and (3) ASystem, a high-performance RL framework designed to overcome the systemic bottlenecks that impede trillion-parameter model training. Ring-1T delivers breakthrough results across critical benchmarks: 93.4 on AIME-2025, 86.72 on HMMT-2025, 2088 on CodeForces, and 55.94 on ARC-AGI-v1. Notably, it attains a silver medal-level result on the IMO-2025, underscoring its exceptional reasoning capabilities. By releasing the complete 1T parameter MoE model to the community, we provide the research community with direct access to cutting-edge reasoning capabilities. This contribution marks a significant milestone in democratizing large-scale reasoning intelligence and establishes a new baseline for open-source model performance.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First, cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information through lightweight compression and groups information according to their topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally, long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that decouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with GPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in accuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API calls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

<title>How Do LLMs Use Their Depth?</title>

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that large language models do not use their depth uniformly, yet we still lack a fine-grained understanding of their layer-wise prediction dynamics. In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations of several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and nuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a "Guess-then-Refine" framework that explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make predictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers are composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical guesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate contextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the model, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens. Even high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the time, indicating that correct token prediction is not "one-and-done". We then go beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer depth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that function words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii) Fact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token requires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task analysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the first half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end. Together, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding light on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions and providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in transformer-based models.

<title>Grasp Any Region: Towards Precise, Contextual Pixel Understanding for Multimodal LLMs</title>

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes, requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However, previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding. Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports (1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2) modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5 on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

Abstract: The decisions of individuals and organizations are often suboptimal because fully rational decision-making is too demanding in the real world. Recent work suggests that some errors can be prevented by leveraging artificial intelligence to discover and teach clever heuristics. So far, this line of research has been limited to simplified, artificial decision-making tasks. This article is the first to extend this approach to a real-world decision problem, namely, executives deciding which project their organization should launch next. We develop a computational method (MGPS) that automatically discovers project selection strategies that are optimized for real people, and we develop an intelligent tutor that teaches the discovered project selection procedures. We evaluated MGPS on a computational benchmark and tested the intelligent tutor in a training experiment with two control conditions. MGPS outperformed a state-of-the-art method and was more computationally efficient. Moreover, people who practiced with our intelligent tutor learned significantly better project selection strategies than the control groups. These findings suggest that AI could be used to automate the process of discovering and formalizing the cognitive strategies taught by intelligent tutoring systems.

Abstract: Modeling large-scale time series has gained significant attention in recent years. However, its direct application in finance remains challenging due to substantial differences in data characteristics across domains. Specifically, financial systems feature inherent stochasticity and low signal-to-noise ratios, rendering traditional methods and pre-training approaches ineffective. This underscores the urgent need for a foundation model tailored to financial time series. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{LENS}, a pre-trained model for this domain. \textbf{LENS} effectively captures the complexity of financial stochastic systems through a carefully crafted model architecture and mitigates noise during pre-training by using an invertible embedding module. We provide a rigorous theoretical explanation of the model's effectiveness and validate its performance through extensive experiments. Pre-trained on a dataset comprising 100 billion financial observations, \textbf{LENS} achieves exceptional results across a wide range of critical downstream tasks. Moreover, our work offers practical insights into developing pre-trained time series models in high-noise environments, paving the way for further advancements in this pivotal research domain.

<title>Counterfactual Effect Decomposition in Multi-Agent Sequential Decision Making</title>

Abstract: We address the challenge of explaining counterfactual outcomes in multi-agent Markov decision processes. In particular, we aim to explain the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action on the outcome of a realized scenario through its influence on the environment dynamics and the agents' behavior. To achieve this, we introduce a novel causal explanation formula that decomposes the counterfactual effect by attributing to each agent and state variable a score reflecting their respective contributions to the effect. First, we show that the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action can be decomposed into two components: one measuring the effect that propagates through all subsequent agents' actions and another related to the effect that propagates through the state transitions. Building on recent advancements in causal contribution analysis, we further decompose these two effects as follows. For the former, we consider agent-specific effects -- a causal concept that quantifies the counterfactual effect of an agent's action that propagates through a subset of agents. Based on this notion, we use Shapley value to attribute the effect to individual agents. For the latter, we consider the concept of structure-preserving interventions and attribute the effect to state variables based on their "intrinsic" contributions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the interpretability of our approach in a Gridworld environment with LLM-assisted agents and a sepsis management simulator.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in mathematical theorem proving, particularly when utilizing formal languages such as LEAN. A prevalent proof method involves the LLM prover iteratively constructing the proof tactic by tactic, typically following a best-first search scheme. However, this method often ignores the critical preference information inside the existing tactic trajectories, hindering the search for deeper proofs. We propose an intuitive yet effective method, which utilizes a critic model to capture the preference information and to guide the search of the prover model at runtime. Given the prover-critic framework, a large-scale expert iteration with more than 20,000 CPU days is then applied to further fine-tune the prover and the critic. The trained InternLM2.5-StepProver critic significantly boosts the performance of the prover model (59.4% to 65.9%). We also analyze the impact of the critic on various aspects of the theorem proving process during expert iteration, providing insights into its effectiveness. We open-source our models and searched proofs at https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-Math and https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/Lean-Workbook.

<title>Do LLMs Strategically Reveal, Conceal, and Infer Information? A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis in The Chameleon Game</title>

Abstract: Large language model-based (LLM-based) agents have become common in settings that include non-cooperative parties. In such settings, agents' decision-making needs to conceal information from their adversaries, reveal information to their cooperators, and infer information to identify the other agents' characteristics. To investigate whether LLMs have these information control and decision-making capabilities, we make LLM agents play the language-based hidden-identity game, The Chameleon. In this game, a group of non-chameleon agents who do not know each other aim to identify the chameleon agent without revealing a secret. The game requires the aforementioned information control capabilities both as a chameleon and a non-chameleon. We begin with a theoretical analysis for a spectrum of strategies, from concealing to revealing, and provide bounds on the non-chameleons' winning probability. The empirical results with GPT, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3.1, and Qwen3 models show that while non-chameleon LLM agents identify the chameleon, they fail to conceal the secret from the chameleon, and their winning probability is far from the levels of even trivial strategies. Based on these empirical results and our theoretical analysis, we deduce that LLM-based agents may reveal excessive information to agents of unknown identities. Interestingly, we find that, when instructed to adopt an information-revealing level, this level is linearly encoded in the LLM's internal representations. While the instructions alone are often ineffective at making non-chameleon LLMs conceal, we show that steering the internal representations in this linear direction directly can reliably induce concealing behavior.

Abstract: As AI systems advance beyond human capabilities, scalable oversight becomes critical: how can we supervise AI that exceeds our abilities? A key challenge is that human evaluators may form incorrect beliefs about AI behavior in complex tasks, leading to unreliable feedback and poor value inference. To address this, we propose modeling evaluators' beliefs to interpret their feedback more reliably. We formalize human belief models, analyze their theoretical role in value learning, and characterize when ambiguity remains. To reduce reliance on precise belief models, we introduce "belief model covering" as a relaxation. This motivates our preliminary proposal to use the internal representations of adapted foundation models to mimic human evaluators' beliefs. These representations could be used to learn correct values from human feedback even when evaluators misunderstand the AI's behavior. Our work suggests that modeling human beliefs can improve value learning and outlines practical research directions for implementing this approach to scalable oversight.

Abstract: The ability of artificial intelligence agents to make optimal decisions and generalise them to different domains and tasks is compromised in complex scenarios. One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them in state-action transitions. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enhance the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions, and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. We demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task relevant structural patterns across CREATE and MiniGrid environments. Finally, we integrate SETLE with reinforcement learning and show measurable improvements in downstream performance, including breakthrough success rates in complex, sparse-reward tasks.

Abstract: Standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) relies on chunk-based retrieval, whereas GraphRAG advances this approach by graph-based knowledge representation. However, existing graph-based RAG approaches are constrained by binary relations, as each edge in an ordinary graph connects only two entities, limiting their ability to represent the n-ary relations (n >= 2) in real-world knowledge. In this work, we propose HyperGraphRAG, a novel hypergraph-based RAG method that represents n-ary relational facts via hyperedges, and consists of knowledge hypergraph construction, retrieval, and generation. Experiments across medicine, agriculture, computer science, and law demonstrate that HyperGraphRAG outperforms both standard RAG and previous graph-based RAG methods in answer accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/LHRLAB/HyperGraphRAG.

Abstract: Being able to cooperate with diverse humans is an important component of many economically valuable AI tasks, from household robotics to autonomous driving. However, generalizing to novel humans requires training on data that captures the diversity of human behaviors. Adversarial training is a promising method that allows dynamic data generation and ensures that agents are robust. It creates a feedback loop where the agent's performance influences the generation of new adversarial data, which can be used immediately to train the agent. However, adversarial training is difficult to apply in a cooperative task; how can we train an adversarial cooperator? We propose a novel strategy that combines a pretrained generative model to simulate valid cooperative agent policies with adversarial training to maximize regret. We call our method GOAT: Generative Online Adversarial Training. In this framework, the GOAT dynamically searches the latent space of the generative model for coordination strategies where the learning policy, the Cooperator agent, underperforms. GOAT enables better generalization by exposing the Cooperator to various challenging interaction scenarios. We maintain realistic coordination strategies by keeping the generative model frozen, thus avoiding adversarial exploitation. We evaluate GOAT with real human partners, and the results demonstrate state of the art performance on the Overcooked benchmark, highlighting its effectiveness in generalizing to diverse human behaviors.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy from a static dataset without further interactions with the environment. Collecting sufficiently large datasets for offline RL is exhausting since this data collection requires colossus interactions with environments and becomes tricky when the interaction with the environment is restricted. Hence, how an agent learns the best policy with a minimal static dataset is a crucial issue in offline RL, similar to the sample efficiency problem in online RL. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play pretraining method to initialize a feature of a Q-network to enhance data efficiency in offline RL. Specifically, we introduce a shared Q-network structure that outputs predictions of the next state and Q-value. We pretrain the shared Q-network through a supervised regression task that predicts a next state and trains the shared Q-network using diverse offline RL methods. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing popular offline RL methods on the D4RL, Robomimic and V-D4RL benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that our method significantly boosts data-efficient offline RL across various data qualities and data distributions trough D4RL and ExoRL benchmarks. Notably, our method adapted with only 10% of the dataset outperforms standard algorithms even with full datasets.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) now rival human performance on many multimodal tasks, yet they still hallucinate objects or generate unsafe text. Current hallucination detectors, e.g., single-token linear probing (LP) and PTrue, typically analyze only the logit of the first generated token or just its highest-scoring component, overlooking richer signals embedded within earlier token distributions. We demonstrate that analyzing the complete sequence of early logits potentially provides substantially more diagnostic information. We emphasize that hallucinations may only emerge after several tokens, as subtle inconsistencies accumulate over time. By analyzing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between logits corresponding to hallucinated and non-hallucinated tokens, we underscore the importance of incorporating later-token logits to more accurately capture the reliability dynamics of VLMs. In response, we introduce Multi-Token Reliability Estimation (MTRE), a lightweight, white-box method that aggregates logits from the first ten tokens using multi-token log-likelihood ratios and self-attention. Despite the challenges posed by large vocabulary sizes and long logit sequences, MTRE remains efficient and tractable. Across MAD-Bench, MM-SafetyBench, MathVista, and four compositional-geometry benchmarks, MTRE achieves a 9.4% gain in accuracy and a 14.8% gain in AUROC over standard detection methods, establishing a new state of the art in hallucination detection for open-source VLMs.

Abstract: Building credible simulators from data is difficult because structure design, parameter calibration, and out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness are tightly coupled. We introduce SOCIA (Simulation Orchestration for Computational Intelligence with Agents), a framework that treats simulator construction as joint structure-parameter co-optimization: it elicits mechanism-rich blueprints, exposes explicit tunable parameters, and instantiates a calibration schema, producing an executable simulator with built-in calibration hooks. SOCIA couples Bayesian Optimization for sample-efficient point calibration with Simulation-Based Inference for uncertainty-aware fitting; diagnostics trigger targeted structural edits in an outer refinement loop to co-optimize design and parameters under tight budgets. Across three diverse tasks, SOCIA consistently outperforms strong baselines, excelling on both in-distribution (ID) fitting and OOD shift. Ablations that weaken structure, calibration design, or tuning yield near-monotone degradations, underscoring the necessity of unified structure-parameter optimization. We will release the code soon.

Abstract: LLM-based agent systems are emerging as a new software paradigm and have been widely adopted across diverse domains such as medicine, robotics, and programming. However, maintaining these systems requires substantial effort, as they are inevitably prone to bugs and continually evolve to meet changing external requirements. Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e., bug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While recent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in addressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how effectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ significantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually analyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent issues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AGENTISSUE-BENCH, a reproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an executable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate state-of-the-art SE agents on AGENTISSUE-BENCH and reveal their limited effectiveness (i.e., with only 3.33% - 12.67% resolution rates). These results underscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to traditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop advanced SE agents for resolving agent issues.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to contain extensive world knowledge in their parameters, enabling impressive performance on many knowledge intensive tasks. However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter situations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or unfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine knowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of counterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop reasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual reasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge. Moreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill counterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored parametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of current LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings.

Abstract: Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators. Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models, highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.

Abstract: With the rapid development of mobile intelligent assistant technologies, multi-modal AI assistants have become essential interfaces for daily user interactions. However, current evaluation methods face challenges including high manual costs, inconsistent standards, and subjective bias. This paper proposes an automated multi-modal evaluation framework based on large language models and multi-agent collaboration. The framework employs a three-tier agent architecture consisting of interaction evaluation agents, semantic verification agents, and experience decision agents. Through supervised fine-tuning on the Qwen3-8B model, we achieve a significant evaluation matching accuracy with human experts.

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks; however, it remains challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability during extended training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.9%, demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop automation. Our code and the new OfficeWorld benchmark are available at https://github.com/thudm/ComputerRL. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et al., 2024b).

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex, multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM) that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0% to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as $0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents' reliability and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in automated code generation but frequently produce code that fails formal verification, an essential requirement for hardware and safety-critical domains. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed PREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that iteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically steering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly fine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3) employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a challenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization consistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by up to 21%. Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis flows. These results demonstrate a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for LLM-driven, formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural-language specification and silicon realization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized. Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Aireduce952/Tree-of-Agents.

Abstract: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control of model behavior.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in various domains, showing impressive potential on different tasks. Recently, reasoning LLMs have been proposed to improve the \textit{reasoning} or \textit{thinking} capabilities of LLMs to solve complex problems. Despite the promising results of reasoning LLMs, enhancing the multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs still remains a significant challenge. While existing optimization methods have advanced the LLM reasoning capabilities, they often treat reasoning trajectories as a whole, without considering the underlying critical steps within the trajectory. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{G}uided \textbf{P}ivotal \textbf{O}ptimization (GPO), a novel fine-tuning strategy that dives into the reasoning process to enable more effective improvements. GPO first identifies the `critical step' within a reasoning trajectory - a point that the model must carefully proceed to succeed at the problem. We locate the critical step by estimating the advantage function. GPO then resets the policy to the critical step, samples the new rollout and prioritizes the learning process on those rollouts. This focus allows the model to learn more effectively from pivotal moments within the reasoning process to improve the reasoning performance. We demonstrate that GPO is a general strategy that can be integrated with various optimization methods to improve reasoning performance. Besides theoretical analysis, our experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks show that GPO can consistently and significantly enhance the performance of existing optimization methods, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability in improving LLM reasoning by concentrating on pivotal moments within the generation process.

Abstract: We introduce transductive program synthesis, a new formulation of the program synthesis task that explicitly leverages test inputs during synthesis. While prior approaches to program synthesis--whether based on natural language descriptions or input-output examples--typically aim to generalize from training examples, they often struggle with robustness, especially in real-world settings where training examples are limited and test inputs involve various edge cases. To address this, we propose a novel framework that improves robustness by treating synthesis as an active learning over a finite hypothesis class defined by programs' outputs. We use an LLM to predict outputs for selected test inputs and eliminate inconsistent hypotheses, where the inputs are chosen via a greedy maximin algorithm to minimize the number of LLM queries required. We evaluate our approach on four benchmarks: Playgol, MBPP+, 1D-ARC, and programmatic world modeling on MiniGrid. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves program synthesis in both accuracy and efficiency. We release our code at https://github.com/klee972/SYNTRA.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models (LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy. However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements, reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

<title>R-Horizon: How Far Can Your Large Reasoning Model Really Go in Breadth and Depth?</title>

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition. Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data, RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e., the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data efficiency.

Abstract: Causal structure learning (CSL), a prominent technique for encoding cause-and-effect relationships among variables, through Bayesian Networks (BNs). Although recovering causal structure solely from data is a challenge, the integration of prior knowledge, revealing partial structural truth, can markedly enhance learning quality. However, current methods based on prior knowledge exhibit limited resilience to errors in the prior, with hard constraint methods disregarding priors entirely, and soft constraints accepting priors based on a predetermined confidence level, which may require expert intervention. To address this issue, we propose a strategy resilient to edge-level prior errors for CSL, thereby minimizing human intervention. We classify prior errors into different types and provide their theoretical impact on the Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) under the presumption of sufficient data. Intriguingly, we discover and prove that the strong hazard of prior errors is associated with a unique acyclic closed structure, defined as ``quasi-circle''. Leveraging this insight, a post-hoc strategy is employed to identify the prior errors by its impact on the increment of ``quasi-circles''. Through empirical evaluation on both real and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate our strategy's robustness against prior errors. Specifically, we highlight its substantial ability to resist order-reversed errors while maintaining the majority of correct prior.

Abstract: Robot learning of manipulation skills is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, unbiased datasets. While curated datasets can help, challenges remain in generalizability and real-world transfer. Meanwhile, large-scale "in-the-wild" video datasets have driven progress in computer vision through self-supervised techniques. Translating this to robotics, recent works have explored learning manipulation skills by passively watching abundant videos sourced online. Showing promising results, such video-based learning paradigms provide scalable supervision while reducing dataset bias. This survey reviews foundations such as video feature representation learning techniques, object affordance understanding, 3D hand/body modeling, and large-scale robot resources, as well as emerging techniques for acquiring robot manipulation skills from uncontrolled video demonstrations. We discuss how learning only from observing large-scale human videos can enhance generalization and sample efficiency for robotic manipulation. The survey summarizes video-based learning approaches, analyses their benefits over standard datasets, survey metrics, and benchmarks, and discusses open challenges and future directions in this nascent domain at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, and robot learning.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code generation, they still struggle with code generation tasks in specific scenarios. These scenarios usually necessitate the adaptation of LLMs to fulfill specific needs, but the limited training data available in practice leads to poor code generation performance. Therefore, how to effectively adapt LLMs to new scenarios with few training data is a major challenge for current code generation. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation approach named DEED, which stands for Data-Efficient adaptation with Error-Driven learning for code generation. DEED leverages the errors made by LLMs as learning opportunities, using error revision to overcome their own shortcomings, thus achieving efficient learning. Specifically, DEED involves identifying error code generated by LLMs, employing Self-Revise for code revision, optimizing the model with revised code, and iteratively adapting the process for continuous improvement. Experimental results show that, compared to other mainstream fine-tuning approaches, DEED achieves superior performance with few training data, showing an average relative improvement of 46.2% in Pass@1 on multiple code generation benchmarks. We also validate the effectiveness of Self-Revise, which generates revised code that optimizes the model more efficiently compared to the code samples from datasets. Moreover, DEED consistently demonstrates strong performance across various LLMs, underscoring its applicability.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought a pressing challenge: how to reliably assess hallucinations to guarantee model trustworthiness. Although Automatic Hallucination Evaluation (AHE) has become an indispensable component of this effort, the field remains fragmented in its methodologies, limiting both conceptual clarity and practical progress. This survey addresses this critical gap through a systematic analysis of 105 evaluation methods, revealing that 77.1% specifically target LLMs, a paradigm shift that demands new evaluation frameworks. We formulate a structured framework to organize the field, based on a survey of foundational datasets and benchmarks and a taxonomy of evaluation methodologies, which together systematically document the evolution from pre-LLM to post-LLM approaches. Beyond taxonomical organization, we identify fundamental limitations in current approaches and their implications for real-world deployment. To guide future research, we delineate key challenges and propose strategic directions, including enhanced interpretability mechanisms and integration of application-specific evaluation criteria, ultimately providing a roadmap for developing more robust and practical hallucination evaluation systems.

Abstract: Mitigating bias in automated decision-making systems, particularly in deep learning models, is a critical challenge due to nuanced definitions of fairness, dataset-specific biases, and the inherent trade-off between fairness and accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce FairVIC, an innovative approach that enhances fairness in neural networks by integrating variance, invariance, and covariance terms into the loss function during training. Unlike methods that rely on predefined fairness criteria, FairVIC abstracts fairness concepts to minimise dependency on protected characteristics. We evaluate FairVIC against comparable bias mitigation techniques on benchmark datasets, considering both group and individual fairness, and conduct an ablation study on the accuracy-fairness trade-off. FairVIC demonstrates significant improvements ($\approx70\%$) in fairness across all tested metrics without compromising accuracy, thus offering a robust, generalisable solution for fair deep learning across diverse tasks and datasets.

Abstract: We propose BlockScan, a customized Transformer for anomaly detection in blockchain transactions. Unlike existing methods that rely on rule-based systems or directly apply off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs), BlockScan introduces a series of customized designs to effectively model the unique data structure of blockchain transactions. First, a blockchain transaction is multi-modal, containing blockchain-specific tokens, texts, and numbers. We design a novel modularized tokenizer to handle these multi-modal inputs, balancing the information across different modalities. Second, we design a customized masked language modeling mechanism for pretraining the Transformer architecture, incorporating RoPE embedding and FlashAttention for handling longer sequences. Finally, we design a novel anomaly detection method based on the model outputs. We further provide theoretical analysis for the detection method of our system. Extensive evaluations on Ethereum and Solana transactions demonstrate BlockScan's exceptional capability in anomaly detection while maintaining a low false positive rate. Remarkably, BlockScan is the only method that successfully detects anomalous transactions on Solana with high accuracy, whereas all other approaches achieved very low or zero detection recall scores. This work sets a new benchmark for applying Transformer-based approaches in blockchain data analysis.

Key results, such as the law of large numbers and the functional central limit theorem, are known for weakly dependent variables. We demonstrate the transfer of mixing properties from the exogenous regressor to the response via coupling arguments. Additionally, we study Markov chains in random environments with drift and minorization conditions, even under non-stationary environments with favorable mixing properties, and apply this framework to single-server queuing models.

Abstract: Text embedding has become a foundational technology in natural language processing (NLP) during the deep learning era, driving advancements across a wide array of downstream tasks. While many natural language understanding challenges can now be modeled using generative paradigms and leverage the robust generative and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerous practical applications - such as semantic matching, clustering, and information retrieval - continue to rely on text embeddings for their efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, integrating LLMs with text embeddings has become a major research focus in recent years. In this survey, we categorize the interplay between LLMs and text embeddings into three overarching themes: (1) LLM-augmented text embedding, enhancing traditional embedding methods with LLMs; (2) LLMs as text embedders, adapting their innate capabilities for high-quality embedding; and (3) Text embedding understanding with LLMs, leveraging LLMs to analyze and interpret embeddings. By organizing recent works based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream applications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from various research and application domains in the era of LLMs. Furthermore, we highlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought forth by LLMs. Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for the evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical opportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP.

Abstract: Palmprint recognition has emerged as a prominent biometric technology, widely applied in diverse scenarios. Traditional handcrafted methods for palmprint recognition often fall short in representation capability, as they heavily depend on researchers' prior knowledge. Deep learning (DL) has been introduced to address this limitation, leveraging its remarkable successes across various domains. While existing surveys focus narrowly on specific tasks within palmprint recognition-often grounded in traditional methodologies-there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research exploring DL-based approaches across all facets of palmprint recognition. This paper bridges that gap by thoroughly reviewing recent advancements in DL-powered palmprint recognition. The paper systematically examines progress across key tasks, including region-of-interest segmentation, feature extraction, and security/privacy-oriented challenges. Beyond highlighting these advancements, the paper identifies current challenges and uncovers promising opportunities for future research. By consolidating state-of-the-art progress, this review serves as a valuable resource for researchers, enabling them to stay abreast of cutting-edge technologies and drive innovation in palmprint recognition.

<title>LLM Safety Alignment is Divergence Estimation in Disguise</title>

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework showing that popular LLM alignment methods, including RLHF and its variants, can be understood as divergence estimators between aligned (safe or preferred) and unaligned (harmful or less preferred) distributions. This perspective explains the emergence of separation in the latent space between safe and harmful prompts after alignment. As an application of our general divergence framework, we propose KLDO, a novel KL divergence-based alignment method, and empirically validate its effectiveness. We further show that using compliance-refusal datasets, rather than standard preference-based datasets, leads to stronger separation and improved safety alignment. Finally, to quantify the separation effect, we propose a distance-based metric in the prompt representation space, which also acts as a statistically significant indicator for model safety.

Abstract: Large language models have been widely applied, but can inadvertently encode sensitive or harmful information, raising significant safety concerns. Machine unlearning has emerged to alleviate this concern; however, existing training-time unlearning approaches, relying on coarse-grained loss combinations, have limitations in precisely separating knowledge and balancing removal effectiveness with model utility. In contrast, we propose Fine-grained Activation manipuLation by Contrastive Orthogonal uNalignment (FALCON), a novel representation-guided unlearning approach that leverages information-theoretic guidance for efficient parameter selection, employs contrastive mechanisms to enhance representation separation, and projects conflict gradients onto orthogonal subspaces to resolve conflicts between forgetting and retention objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FALCON achieves superior unlearning effectiveness while maintaining model utility, exhibiting robust resistance against knowledge recovery attempts.

Abstract: Inherent limitations of contemporary machine learning systems in crucial areas -- importantly in continual learning, information reuse, comprehensibility, and integration with deliberate behavior -- are receiving increasing attention. To address these challenges, we introduce a system design, fueled by a novel learning approach conceptually grounded in principles of evolutionary developmental biology, that overcomes key limitations of current methods. Our design comprises three core components: The Modeller, a gradient-free learning mechanism inherently capable of continual learning and structural adaptation; a planner for goal-directed action over learned models; and a behavior encapsulation mechanism that can decompose complex behaviors into a hierarchical structure. We demonstrate proof-of-principle operation in a simple test environment. Additionally, we extend our modeling framework to higher-dimensional network-structured spaces, using MNIST for a shape detection task. Our framework shows promise in overcoming multiple major limitations of contemporary machine learning systems simultaneously and in an organic manner.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent LLMs (MALLMs) introduce non-determinism unlike traditional or machine learning software, requiring new approaches to verifying correctness beyond simple output comparisons or statistical accuracy over test datasets. This paper presents a taxonomy for LLM test case design, informed by research literature and our experience. Each facet is exemplified, and we conduct an LLM-assisted analysis of six open-source testing frameworks, perform a sensitivity study of an agent-based system across different model configurations, and provide working examples contrasting atomic and aggregated test cases. We identify key variation points that impact test correctness and highlight open challenges that the research, industry, and open-source communities must address as LLMs become integral to software systems. Our taxonomy defines four facets of LLM test case design, addressing ambiguity in both inputs and outputs while establishing best practices. It distinguishes variability in goals, the system under test, and inputs, and introduces two key oracle types: atomic and aggregated. Our findings reveal that current tools treat test executions as isolated events, lack explicit aggregation mechanisms, and inadequately capture variability across model versions, configurations, and repeated runs. This highlights the need for viewing correctness as a distribution of outcomes rather than a binary property, requiring closer collaboration between academia and practitioners to establish mature, variability-aware testing methodologies.

<title>Temporal Alignment of LLMs through Cycle Encoding for Long-Range Time Representations</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) suffer from temporal misalignment issues especially across long span of time. The issue arises from knowing that LLMs are trained on large amounts of data where temporal information is rather sparse over long times, such as thousands of years, resulting in insufficient learning or catastrophic forgetting by the LLMs. This paper proposes a methodology named "Ticktack" for addressing the LLM's long-time span misalignment in a yearly setting. Specifically, we first propose to utilize the sexagenary year expression instead of the Gregorian year expression employed by LLMs, achieving a more uniform distribution in yearly granularity. Then, we employ polar coordinates to model the sexagenary cycle of 60 terms and the year order within each term, with additional temporal encoding to ensure LLMs understand them. Finally, we present a temporal representational alignment approach for post-training LLMs that effectively distinguishes time points with relevant knowledge, hence improving performance on time-related tasks, particularly over a long period. We also create a long time span benchmark for evaluation. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our proposal.

<title>Energy Matching: Unifying Flow Matching and Energy-Based Models for Generative Modeling</title>

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art generative models map noise to data distributions by matching flows or scores. A key limitation of these models is their inability to readily integrate available partial observations and additional priors. In contrast, energy-based models (EBMs) address this by incorporating corresponding scalar energy terms. Here, we propose Energy Matching, a framework that endows flow-based approaches with the flexibility of EBMs. Far from the data manifold, samples move from noise to data along irrotational, optimal transport paths. As they approach the data manifold, an entropic energy term guides the system into a Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, explicitly capturing the underlying likelihood structure of the data. We parameterize these dynamics with a single time-independent scalar field, which serves as both a powerful generator and a flexible prior for effective regularization of inverse problems. The present method substantially outperforms existing EBMs on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet generation in terms of fidelity, while retaining simulation-free training of transport-based approaches away from the data manifold. Furthermore, we leverage the flexibility of the method to introduce an interaction energy that supports the exploration of diverse modes, which we demonstrate in a controlled protein generation setting. This approach learns a scalar potential energy, without time conditioning, auxiliary generators, or additional networks, marking a significant departure from recent EBM methods. We believe this simplified yet rigorous formulation significantly advances EBMs capabilities and paves the way for their wider adoption in generative modeling in diverse domains.

<title>VLLFL: A Vision-Language Model Based Lightweight Federated Learning Framework for Smart Agriculture</title>

Abstract: In modern smart agriculture, object detection plays a crucial role by enabling automation, precision farming, and monitoring of resources. From identifying crop health and pest infestations to optimizing harvesting processes, accurate object detection enhances both productivity and sustainability. However, training object detection models often requires large-scale data collection and raises privacy concerns, particularly when sensitive agricultural data is distributed across farms. To address these challenges, we propose VLLFL, a vision-language model-based lightweight federated learning framework (VLLFL). It harnesses the generalization and context-aware detection capabilities of the vision-language model (VLM) and leverages the privacy-preserving nature of federated learning. By training a compact prompt generator to boost the performance of the VLM deployed across different farms, VLLFL preserves privacy while reducing communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that VLLFL achieves 14.53% improvement in the performance of VLM while reducing 99.3% communication overhead. Spanning tasks from identifying a wide variety of fruits to detecting harmful animals in agriculture, the proposed framework offers an efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving solution specifically tailored to agricultural applications.

Abstract: Although inspired by neuronal systems in the brain, artificial neural networks generally employ point-neurons, which offer far less computational complexity than their biological counterparts. Neurons have dendritic arbors that connect to different sets of synapses and offer local non-linear accumulation - playing a pivotal role in processing and learning. Inspired by this, we propose a novel neuron design based on a multi-gate ferroelectric field-effect transistor that mimics dendrites. It leverages ferroelectric nonlinearity for local computations within dendritic branches, while utilizing the transistor action to generate the final neuronal output. The branched architecture paves the way for utilizing smaller crossbar arrays in hardware integration, leading to greater efficiency. Using an experimentally calibrated device-circuit-algorithm co-simulation framework, we demonstrate that networks incorporating our dendritic neurons achieve superior performance in comparison to much larger networks without dendrites ($\sim$17$\times$ fewer trainable weight parameters). These findings suggest that dendritic hardware can significantly improve computational efficiency, and learning capacity of neuromorphic systems optimized for edge applications.

Abstract: While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved impressive results in natural image synthesis, their core strengths - creativity and realism - can be detrimental in medical applications, where accuracy and fidelity are paramount. These models instead risk introducing hallucinations and replication of unwanted acquisition noise. Here, we propose YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a 2.5D diffusion-based framework for medical image translation (MIT). Consistent with DM theory, we find that conventional diffusion sampling stochastically replicates noise. To mitigate this, we draw and average multiple samples, akin to physical signal averaging. As this effectively approximates the DM's expected value, we term this Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) sampling. We additionally propose regression sampling YODA, which retains the initial DM prediction and omits iterative refinement to produce noise-free images in a single step. Across five diverse multi-modal datasets - including multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we demonstrate that regression sampling is not only substantially more efficient but also matches or exceeds image quality of full diffusion sampling even with ExpA. Our results reveal that iterative refinement solely enhances perceptual realism without benefiting information translation, which we confirm in relevant downstream tasks. YODA outperforms eight state-of-the-art DMs and GANs and challenges the presumed superiority of DMs and GANs over computationally cheap regression models for high-quality MIT. Furthermore, we show that YODA-translated images are interchangeable with, or even superior to, physical acquisitions for several medical applications.

Abstract: With the growing requirement for natural human-computer interaction, speech-based systems receive increasing attention as speech is one of the most common forms of daily communication. However, the existing speech models still experience high latency when generating the first audio token during streaming, which poses a significant bottleneck for deployment. To address this issue, we propose VITA-Audio, an end-to-end large speech model with fast audio-text token generation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Multiple Cross-modal Token Prediction (MCTP) module that efficiently generates multiple audio tokens within a single model forward pass, which not only accelerates the inference but also significantly reduces the latency for generating the first audio in streaming scenarios. In addition, a four-stage progressive training strategy is explored to achieve model acceleration with minimal loss of speech quality. To our knowledge, VITA-Audio is the first multi-modal large language model capable of generating audio output during the first forward pass, enabling real-time conversational capabilities with minimal latency. VITA-Audio is fully reproducible and is trained on open-source data only. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves an inference speedup of 3~5x at the 7B parameter scale, but also significantly outperforms open-source models of similar model size on multiple benchmarks for automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and spoken question answering (SQA) tasks.

Abstract: The adoption of open science has quickly changed how artificial intelligence (AI) policy research is distributed globally. This study examines the regional trends in the citation of preprints, specifically focusing on the impact of two major disruptive events: the COVID-19 pandemic and the release of ChatGPT, on research dissemination patterns in the United States, Europe, and South Korea from 2015 to 2024. Using bibliometrics data from the Web of Science, this study tracks how global disruptive events influenced the adoption of preprints in AI policy research and how such shifts vary by region. By marking the timing of these disruptive events, the analysis reveals that while all regions experienced growth in preprint citations, the magnitude and trajectory of change varied significantly. The United States exhibited sharp, event-driven increases; Europe demonstrated institutional growth; and South Korea maintained consistent, linear growth in preprint adoption. These findings suggest that global disruptions may have accelerated preprint adoption, but the extent and trajectory are shaped by local research cultures, policy environments, and levels of open science maturity. This paper emphasizes the need for future AI governance strategies to consider regional variability in research dissemination and highlights opportunities for further longitudinal and comparative research to deepen our understanding of open-access adoption in AI policy development.

Abstract: Continued pretraining and instruction tuning on large-scale multilingual data have proven to be effective in scaling large language models (LLMs) to low-resource languages. However, the unaligned nature of such data limits its ability to effectively capture cross-lingual semantics. In contrast, multi-way parallel data, where identical content is aligned across multiple languages, provides stronger cross-lingual consistency and offers greater potential for improving multilingual performance. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality multi-way parallel corpus, TED2025, based on TED Talks. The corpus spans 113 languages, with up to 50 languages aligned in parallel, ensuring extensive multilingual coverage. Using this dataset, we investigate best practices for leveraging multi-way parallel data to enhance LLMs, including strategies for continued pretraining, instruction tuning, and the analysis of key influencing factors. Experiments on six multilingual benchmarks show that models trained on multiway parallel data consistently outperform those trained on unaligned multilingual data.

Abstract: We study the approximation capabilities, convergence speeds and on-convergence behaviors of transformers trained on in-context recall tasks -- which requires to recognize the \emph{positional} association between a pair of tokens from in-context examples. Existing theoretical results only focus on the in-context reasoning behavior of transformers after being trained for the \emph{one} gradient descent step. It remains unclear what is the on-convergence behavior of transformers being trained by gradient descent and how fast the convergence rate is. In addition, the generalization of transformers in one-step in-context reasoning has not been formally investigated. This work addresses these gaps. We first show that a class of transformers with either linear, ReLU or softmax attentions, is provably Bayes-optimal for an in-context recall task. When being trained with gradient descent, we show via a finite-sample analysis that the expected loss converges at linear rate to the Bayes risks. Moreover, we show that the trained transformers exhibit out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, i.e., generalizing to samples outside of the population distribution. Our theoretical findings are further supported by extensive empirical validations, showing that \emph{without} proper parameterization, models with larger expressive power surprisingly \emph{fail} to generalize OOD after being trained by gradient descent.

Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) streamlines the automation of optimization algorithm design through meta-learning. It typically employs a bi-level structure: the meta-level policy undergoes meta-training to reduce the manual effort required in developing algorithms for low-level optimization tasks. The original MetaBox (2023) provided the first open-source framework for reinforcement learning-based single-objective MetaBBO. However, its relatively narrow scope no longer keep pace with the swift advancement in this field. In this paper, we introduce MetaBox-v2 (https://github.com/MetaEvo/MetaBox) as a milestone upgrade with four novel features: 1) a unified architecture supporting RL, evolutionary, and gradient-based approaches, by which we reproduce $23$ up-to-date baselines; 2) efficient parallelization schemes, which reduce the training/testing time by $10-40$x; 3) a comprehensive benchmark suite of $18$ synthetic/realistic tasks ($1900$+ instances) spanning single-objective, multi-objective, multi-model, and multi-task optimization scenarios; 4) plentiful and extensible interfaces for custom analysis/visualization and integrating to external optimization tools/benchmarks. To show the utility of MetaBox-v2, we carry out a systematic case study that evaluates the built-in baselines in terms of the optimization performance, generalization ability and learning efficiency. Valuable insights are concluded from thorough and detailed analysis for practitioners and those new to the field.

Abstract: We introduce CoLoRA (Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CoLoRA extends LoRA to convolutional layers by decomposing kernel updates into lightweight depthwise and pointwise components.This design reduces the number of trainable parameters to 0.2 compared to conventional fine-tuning, preserves the original model size, and allows merging updates into the pretrained weights after each epoch, keeping inference complexity unchanged. On OCTMNISTv2, CoLoRA applied to VGG16 and ResNet50 achieves up to 1 percent accuracy and 0.013 AUC improvements over strong baselines (Vision Transformers, state-space, and Kolmogorov Arnold models) while reducing per-epoch training time by nearly 20 percent. Results indicate that CoLoRA provides a stable and effective alternative to full fine-tuning for medical image classification.

Abstract: Gradient-based data attribution methods, such as influence functions, are critical for understanding the impact of individual training samples without requiring repeated model retraining. However, their scalability is often limited by the high computational and memory costs associated with per-sample gradient computation. In this work, we propose GraSS, a novel gradient compression algorithm and its variants FactGraSS for linear layers specifically, that explicitly leverage the inherent sparsity of per-sample gradients to achieve sub-linear space and time complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving substantial speedups while preserving data influence fidelity. In particular, FactGraSS achieves up to 165% faster throughput on billion-scale models compared to the previous state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/TRAIS-Lab/GraSS.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through test-time scaling approaches, particularly when fine-tuned with chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from more powerful large reasoning models (LRMs). However, these reasoning chains often contain verbose elements that mirror human problem-solving, categorized as progressive reasoning (the essential solution development path) and functional elements (verification processes, alternative solution approaches, and error corrections). While progressive reasoning is crucial, the functional elements significantly increase computational demands during test-time inference. We introduce PIR (Perplexity-based Importance Refinement), a principled framework that quantitatively evaluates the importance of each reasoning step based on its impact on answer prediction confidence. PIR systematically identifies and selectively prunes only low-importance functional steps while preserving progressive reasoning components, creating optimized training data that maintains the integrity of the core solution path while reducing verbosity. Models fine-tuned on PIR-optimized data exhibit superior test-time scaling properties, generating more concise reasoning chains while achieving improved accuracy (+0.9\% to +6.6\%) with significantly reduced token usage (-3\% to -41\%) across challenging reasoning benchmarks (AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond). Our approach demonstrates strong generalizability across different model sizes, data sources, and token budgets, offering a practical solution for deploying reasoning-capable LLMs in scenarios where efficient test-time scaling, response time, and computational efficiency are valuable constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results across diverse downstream tasks, but their monolithic nature restricts scalability and efficiency in complex problem-solving. While recent research explores multi-agent collaboration among LLMs, most approaches rely on static organizational structures that struggle to adapt as task complexity and agent numbers grow, resulting in coordination overhead and inefficiencies. To this end, we propose a puppeteer-style paradigm for LLM-based multi-agent collaboration, where a centralized orchestrator ("puppeteer") dynamically directs agents ("puppets") in response to evolving task states. This orchestrator is trained via reinforcement learning to adaptively sequence and prioritize agents, enabling flexible and evolvable collective reasoning. Experiments on closed- and open-domain scenarios show that this method achieves superior performance with reduced computational costs. Analyses further reveal that the key improvements consistently stem from the emergence of more compact, cyclic reasoning structures under the orchestrator's evolution. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev/tree/puppeteer.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, LLaMA, and Claude achieve remarkable performance in text generation but remain opaque in their decision-making processes, limiting trust and accountability in high-stakes applications. We present gSMILE (generative SMILE), a model-agnostic, perturbation-based framework for token-level interpretability in LLMs. Extending the SMILE methodology, gSMILE uses controlled prompt perturbations, Wasserstein distance metrics, and weighted linear surrogates to identify input tokens with the most significant impact on the output. This process enables the generation of intuitive heatmaps that visually highlight influential tokens and reasoning paths. We evaluate gSMILE across leading LLMs (OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct, Meta's LLaMA 3.1 Instruct Turbo, and Anthropic's Claude 2.1) using attribution fidelity, attribution consistency, attribution stability, attribution faithfulness, and attribution accuracy as metrics. Results show that gSMILE delivers reliable human-aligned attributions, with Claude 2.1 excelling in attention fidelity and GPT-3.5 achieving the highest output consistency. These findings demonstrate gSMILE's ability to balance model performance and interpretability, enabling more transparent and trustworthy AI systems.

<title>Segment Policy Optimization: Effective Segment-Level Credit Assignment in RL for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models effectively using reinforcement learning (RL) remains a crucial challenge. Existing approaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities: token-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide fine-grained advantage signals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training an accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g., GRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward, leading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we propose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages segment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a better balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level methods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods, enabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a critic model. SPO features three components with novel strategies: (1) flexible segment partition; (2) accurate segment advantage estimation; and (3) policy optimization using segment advantages, including a novel probability-mask strategy. We further instantiate SPO for two specific scenarios: (1) SPO-chain for short chain-of-thought (CoT), featuring novel cutpoint-based partition and chain-based advantage estimation, achieving $6$-$12$ percentage point improvements in accuracy over PPO and GRPO on GSM8K. (2) SPO-tree for long CoT, featuring novel tree-based advantage estimation, which significantly reduces the cost of MC estimation, achieving $7$-$11$ percentage point improvements over GRPO on MATH500 under 2K and 4K context evaluation. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/AIFrameResearch/SPO.

Abstract: Sequence models such as transformers require inputs to be represented as one-dimensional sequences. In vision, this typically involves flattening images using a fixed row-major (raster-scan) order. While full self-attention is permutation-equivariant, modern long-sequence transformers increasingly rely on architectural approximations that break this invariance and introduce sensitivity to patch ordering. We show that patch order significantly affects model performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major or Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we propose REOrder, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch orderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the compressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over permutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This approach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space. REOrder improves top-1 accuracy over row-major ordering on ImageNet-1K by up to 3.01% and Functional Map of the World by 13.35%.

Abstract: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for adapting pre-trained language models to downstream tasks are susceptible to interference from noisy data. Conventional noise-handling approaches either rely on laborious data pre-processing or employ model architecture modifications prone to error accumulation. In contrast to existing noise-process paradigms, we propose a noise-robust adaptation method via asymmetric LoRA poisoning experts (LoPE), a novel framework that enhances model robustness to noise only with generated noisy data. Drawing inspiration from the mixture-of-experts architecture, LoPE strategically integrates a dedicated poisoning expert in an asymmetric LoRA configuration. Through a two-stage paradigm, LoPE performs noise injection on the poisoning expert during fine-tuning to enhance its noise discrimination and processing ability. During inference, we selectively mask the dedicated poisoning expert to leverage purified knowledge acquired by normal experts for noise-robust output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoPE achieves strong performance and robustness purely through the low-cost noise injection, which completely eliminates the requirement of data cleaning.

<title>EvaLearn: Quantifying the Learning Capability and Efficiency of LLMs via Sequential Problem Solving</title>

Abstract: We introduce EvaLearn, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their learning capability and efficiency in challenging tasks, a critical, yet underexplored aspect of model potential. EvaLearn contains 648 challenging problems across six task types, grouped into 182 sequences, each sequence dedicated to one task type. Diverging from most existing benchmarks that evaluate models in parallel, EvaLearn requires models to solve problems sequentially, allowing them to leverage the experience gained from previous solutions. EvaLearn provides five comprehensive automated metrics to evaluate models and quantify their learning capability and efficiency. We extensively benchmark nine frontier models and observe varied performance profiles: some models, such as Claude-3.7-sonnet, start with moderate initial performance but exhibit strong learning ability, while some models struggle to benefit from experience and may even show negative transfer. Moreover, we investigate model performance under two learning settings and find that instance-level rubrics and teacher-model feedback further facilitate model learning. Importantly, we observe that current LLMs with stronger static abilities do not show a clear advantage in learning capability across all tasks, highlighting that EvaLearn evaluates a new dimension of model performance. We hope EvaLearn provides a novel evaluation perspective for assessing LLM potential and understanding the gap between models and human capabilities, promoting the development of deeper and more dynamic evaluation approaches. All datasets, the automatic evaluation framework, and the results studied in this paper are available at the GitHub repository.

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models exhibit remarkable performance in in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason about the input context on the fly. This work studies in-context counterfactual reasoning in language models, that is, the ability to predict consequences of a hypothetical scenario. We focus on a well-defined, synthetic linear regression task that requires noise abduction. Accurate prediction is based on (1) inferring an unobserved latent concept and (2) copying contextual noise from factual observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual reasoning. Further, we enhance existing identifiability results and reduce counterfactual reasoning for a broad class of functions to a transformation on in-context observations. In Transformers, we find that self-attention, model depth and pre-training data diversity drive performance. Moreover, we provide mechanistic evidence that the latent concept is linearly represented in the residual stream and we introduce designated \textit{noise abduction heads} central to performing counterfactual reasoning. Lastly, our findings extend to counterfactual reasoning under SDE dynamics and reflect that Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our code is available under https://github.com/mrtzmllr/iccr.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large antenna arrays at base stations has significantly improved the spatial resolution and localization accuracy of radio-localization methods. However, traditional signal processing techniques struggle in complex radio environments, particularly in scenarios dominated by non line of sight (NLoS) propagation paths, resulting in degraded localization accuracy. Recent developments in machine learning have facilitated the development of machine learning-assisted localization techniques, enhancing localization accuracy in complex radio environments. However, these methods often involve substantial computational complexity during both the training and inference phases. This work extends the well-established fingerprinting-based localization framework by simultaneously reducing its memory requirements and improving its accuracy. Specifically, a model-based neural network is used to learn the location-to-channel mapping, and then serves as a generative neural channel model. This generative model augments the fingerprinting comparison dictionary while reducing the memory requirements. The proposed method outperforms fingerprinting baselines by achieving sub-wavelength localization accuracy, even in complex static NLoS environments. Remarkably, it offers an improvement by several orders of magnitude in localization accuracy, while simultaneously reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude compared to classical fingerprinting methods.

Abstract: Web-use agents are rapidly being deployed to automate complex web tasks with extensive browser capabilities. However, these capabilities create a critical and previously unexplored attack surface. This paper demonstrates how attackers can exploit web-use agents by embedding malicious content in web pages, such as comments, reviews, or advertisements, that agents encounter during legitimate browsing tasks. We introduce the task-aligned injection technique that frames malicious commands as helpful task guidance rather than obvious attacks, exploiting fundamental limitations in LLMs' contextual reasoning. Agents struggle to maintain coherent contextual awareness and fail to detect when seemingly helpful web content contains steering attempts that deviate them from their original task goal. To scale this attack, we developed an automated three-stage pipeline that generates effective injections without manual annotation or costly online agent interactions during training, remaining efficient even with limited training data. This pipeline produces a generator model that we evaluate on five popular agents using payloads organized by the Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability (CIA) security triad, including unauthorized camera activation, file exfiltration, user impersonation, phishing, and denial-of-service. This generator achieves over 80% attack success rate (ASR) with strong transferability across unseen payloads, diverse web environments, and different underlying LLMs. This attack succeed even against agents with built-in safety mechanisms, requiring only the ability to post content on public websites. To address this risk, we propose comprehensive mitigation strategies including oversight mechanisms, execution constraints, and task-aware reasoning techniques.

Abstract: Long-video understanding~(LVU) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods either downsample frames for single-pass reasoning, sacrificing fine-grained details, or depend on textual reasoning over task-agnostic representations, hindering task-specific perception and exploration. In this paper, we propose VideoExplorer, a framework grounded in the principle of ``thinking with video'', which naturally intertwines planning, temporal grounding, and scalable perception into a coherent reasoning process. Rather than reasoning over a static context, VideoExplorer iteratively formulates sub-questions, locates relevant moments, and performs task-oriented, temporally scalable video understanding until reaching the final answer, enabling faithful, efficient, and interpretable reasoning. To address the lack of LVU training resources, we construct a long-video reasoning dataset using difficulty-adaptive sampling to ensure high-quality trajectories on complex tasks. Building on this dataset, we design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised trajectory initialization followed by trajectory-level preference optimization, encouraging adaptive temporal grounding and iterative information integration guided by downstream rewards. Extensive evaluations on popular long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate VideoExplorer's significant advantage over existing baselines, highlighting its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency. Our code is made publicly available in this repository(https://github.com/yhy-2000/VideoDeepResearch).

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding-particularly in the context of structured geometric data-remains unexplored. This paper initiates a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on manifolds. We establish a novel connection between the attention mechanism and classical kernel methods, demonstrating that transformers effectively perform kernel-based prediction at a new query through its interaction with the prompt. This connection is validated by numerical experiments, revealing that the learned query-prompt scores for H\"older functions are highly correlated with the Gaussian kernel. Building on this insight, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension. Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as in-context kernel algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming search engines into Conversational Search Engines (CSE). Consequently, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO). We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not know whether certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains. Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains, and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are not only largely ineffective but also frequently have a negative impact on document ranking, which is opposite to what is expected. Instead, traditional SEO strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM context, are significantly more effective. We also observe that as we increase the number of C-SEO adopters, the overall gains decrease, depicting a congested and zero-sum nature of the problem. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/parameterlab/c-seo-bench and https://huggingface.co/datasets/parameterlab/c-seo-bench.

Abstract: We identify semantically coherent, context-consistent network components in large language models (LLMs) using coactivation of sparse autoencoder (SAE) features collected from just a handful of prompts. Focusing on concept-relation prediction tasks, we show that ablating these components for concepts (e.g., countries and words) and relations (e.g., capital city and translation language) changes model outputs in predictable ways, while amplifying these components induces counterfactual responses. Notably, composing relation and concept components yields compound counterfactual outputs. Further analysis reveals that while most concept components emerge from the very first layer, more abstract relation components are concentrated in later layers. Lastly, we show that extracted components more comprehensively capture concepts and relations than individual features while maintaining specificity. Overall, our findings suggest a modular organization of knowledge accessed through compositional operations, and advance methods for efficient, targeted LLM manipulation.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning models that leverage quantum circuits as quantum feature maps (QFMs) are recognized for their enhanced expressive power in learning tasks. Such models have demonstrated rigorous end-to-end quantum speedups for specific families of classification problems. However, deploying deep QFMs on real quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit noise and hardware constraints. Additionally, variational quantum algorithms often suffer from computational bottlenecks, particularly in accurate gradient estimation, which significantly increases quantum resource demands during training. We propose Iterative Quantum Feature Maps (IQFMs), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that constructs a deep architecture by iteratively connecting shallow QFMs with classically computed augmentation weights. By incorporating contrastive learning and a layer-wise training mechanism, the IQFMs framework effectively reduces quantum runtime and mitigates noise-induced degradation. In tasks involving noisy quantum data, numerical experiments show that the IQFMs framework outperforms quantum convolutional neural networks, without requiring the optimization of variational quantum parameters. Even for a typical classical image classification benchmark, a carefully designed IQFMs framework achieves performance comparable to that of classical neural networks. This framework presents a promising path to address current limitations and harness the full potential of quantum-enhanced machine learning.

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a major source of injury in hospitals and long-term care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be predicted using only one low-cost load cell mounted under a bed leg. The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps-recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field-that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights. To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.

Abstract: The grand goal of AI research, and particularly Self Supervised Learning (SSL), is to produce systems that can successfully solve any possible task. In contrast, current evaluation methods available to AI researchers typically rely on a fixed collection of hand-picked downstream benchmarks. Hence, a large amount of effort is put into designing and searching for large collection of evaluation tasks that can serve as a proxy of our grand goal. We argue that such a rigid evaluation protocol creates a silent bottleneck in AI research. To remedy that, we define a probabilistic space of downstream tasks obtained by adopting a distribution of tasks and by defining Task Priors. Under this view, one can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream tasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as (i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream tasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the variance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the defined Task Priors? Beyond establishing a new standard for evaluation, we believe that Task Priors will accelerate the pace of research in SSL - where downstream task evaluation is the sole qualitative signal that researchers have access to.

Abstract: Monitoring AIs at runtime can help us detect and stop harmful actions. In this paper, we study how to efficiently combine multiple runtime monitors into a single monitoring protocol. The protocol's objective is to maximize the probability of applying a safety intervention on misaligned outputs (i.e., maximize recall). Since running monitors and applying safety interventions are costly, the protocol also needs to adhere to an average-case budget constraint. Taking the monitors' performance and cost as given, we develop an algorithm to find the best protocol. The algorithm exhaustively searches over when and which monitors to call, and allocates safety interventions based on the Neyman-Pearson lemma. By focusing on likelihood ratios and strategically trading off spending on monitors against spending on interventions, we more than double our recall rate compared to a naive baseline in a code review setting. We also show that combining two monitors can Pareto dominate using either monitor alone. Our framework provides a principled methodology for combining existing monitors to detect undesirable behavior in cost-sensitive settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge. We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs) that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<title>A surrogate model for topology optimisation of elastic structures via parametric autoencoders</title>

Abstract: A surrogate-based topology optimisation algorithm for linear elastic structures under parametric loads and boundary conditions is proposed. Instead of learning the parametric solution of the state (and adjoint) problems or the optimisation trajectory as a function of the iterations, the proposed approach devises a surrogate version of the entire optimisation pipeline. First, the method predicts a quasi-optimal topology for a given problem configuration as a surrogate model of high-fidelity topologies optimised with the homogenisation method. This is achieved by means of a feed-forward net learning the mapping between the input parameters characterising the system setup and a latent space determined by encoder/decoder blocks reducing the dimensionality of the parametric topology optimisation problem and reconstructing a high-dimensional representation of the topology. Then, the predicted topology is used as an educated initial guess for a computationally efficient algorithm penalising the intermediate values of the design variable, while enforcing the governing equations of the system. This step allows the method to correct potential errors introduced by the surrogate model, eliminate artifacts, and refine the design in order to produce topologies consistent with the underlying physics. Different architectures are proposed and the approximation and generalisation capabilities of the resulting models are numerically evaluated. The quasi-optimal topologies allow to outperform the high-fidelity optimiser by reducing the average number of optimisation iterations by $53\%$ while achieving discrepancies below $4\%$ in the optimal value of the objective functional, even in the challenging scenario of testing the model to extrapolate beyond the training and validation domain.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1) Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving efficiency. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Learning-to-Detect-51CB.

Abstract: Reliable autonomous navigation across the unstructured terrains of distant planetary surfaces is a critical enabler for future space exploration. However, the deployment of learning-based controllers is hindered by the inherent sim-to-real gap, particularly for the complex dynamics of wheel interactions with granular media. This work presents a complete sim-to-real framework for developing and validating robust control policies for dynamic waypoint tracking on such challenging surfaces. We leverage massively parallel simulation to train reinforcement learning agents across a vast distribution of procedurally generated environments with randomized physics. These policies are then transferred zero-shot to a physical wheeled rover operating in a lunar-analogue facility. Our experiments systematically compare multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and action smoothing filters to identify the most effective combinations for real-world deployment. Crucially, we provide strong empirical evidence that agents trained with procedural diversity achieve superior zero-shot performance compared to those trained on static scenarios. We also analyze the trade-offs of fine-tuning with high-fidelity particle physics, which offers minor gains in low-speed precision at a significant computational cost. Together, these contributions establish a validated workflow for creating reliable learning-based navigation systems, marking a substantial step towards deploying autonomous robots in the final frontier.

Abstract: We investigate whether synthetic question-answer (QA) data generated by large language models (LLMs) can serve as an effective proxy for human-labeled benchmarks when the latter is unavailable. We assess the reliability of synthetic benchmarks across two experiments: one varying retriever parameters while keeping the generator fixed, and another varying the generator with fixed retriever parameters. Across four datasets, of which two open-domain and two proprietary, we find that synthetic benchmarks reliably rank the RAGs varying in terms of retriever configuration, aligning well with human-labeled benchmark baselines. However, they do not consistently produce reliable RAG rankings when comparing generator architectures. The breakdown possibly arises from a combination of task mismatch between the synthetic and human benchmarks, and stylistic bias favoring certain generators.

<title>AI Agentic Vulnerability Injection And Transformation with Optimized Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2508.20866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems and the sophistication of cyber-attacks have underscored the critical need for effective automated vulnerability detection and repair systems. Data-driven approaches using deep learning models show promise but critically depend on the availability of large, accurately labeled datasets. Yet existing datasets either suffer from noisy labels, limited range of vulnerabilities, or fail to reflect vulnerabilities as they occur in real-world software. This also limits large-scale benchmarking of such solutions. Automated vulnerability injection provides a way to directly address these dataset limitations, but existing techniques remain limited in coverage, contextual fidelity, or injection success rates. In this paper, we present AVIATOR, the first AI-agentic vulnerability injection workflow. It automatically injects realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities for high-fidelity, diverse, large-scale vulnerability dataset generation. Unlike prior monolithic approaches, AVIATOR orchestrates specialized AI agents, function agents and traditional code analysis tools that replicate expert reasoning. It combines semantic analysis, injection synthesis enhanced with LoRA-based fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, as well as post-injection validation via static analysis and LLM-based discriminators. This modular decomposition allows specialized agents to focus on distinct tasks, improving robustness of injection and reducing error propagation across the workflow. Evaluations across three distinct benchmarks demonstrate that AVIATOR achieves 91%-95% injection success rates, significantly surpassing existing automated dataset generation techniques in both accuracy and scope of software vulnerabilities.

arXiv:2509.00398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study provides an in_depth analysis of the ethical and trustworthiness challenges emerging alongside the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and proposes a comprehensive framework for their systematic evaluation. While generative AI, such as ChatGPT, demonstrates remarkable innovative potential, it simultaneously raises ethical and social concerns, including bias, harmfulness, copyright infringement, privacy violations, and hallucination. Current AI evaluation methodologies, which mainly focus on performance and accuracy, are insufficient to address these multifaceted issues. Thus, this study emphasizes the need for new human_centered criteria that also reflect social impact. To this end, it identifies key dimensions for evaluating the ethics and trustworthiness of generative AI_fairness, transparency, accountability, safety, privacy, accuracy, consistency, robustness, explainability, copyright and intellectual property protection, and source traceability and develops detailed indicators and assessment methodologies for each. Moreover, it provides a comparative analysis of AI ethics policies and guidelines in South Korea, the United States, the European Union, and China, deriving key approaches and implications from each. The proposed framework applies across the AI lifecycle and integrates technical assessments with multidisciplinary perspectives, thereby offering practical means to identify and manage ethical risks in real_world contexts. Ultimately, the study establishes an academic foundation for the responsible advancement of generative AI and delivers actionable insights for policymakers, developers, users, and other stakeholders, supporting the positive societal contributions of AI technologies.

Abstract: Increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) services imposes substantial deployment and computation costs on providers. LLM routing offers a cost-efficient solution by directing queries to the optimal LLM based on model and query features. However, existing works primarily focus on offline scenarios and struggle to adapt to online settings with high query volume and constrained token budgets. In this work, we introduce the first training-free algorithm for online routing scenarios. Our algorithm leverages approximate nearest neighbor search to efficiently estimate query features and performs a one-time optimization over a small set of initial queries to learn a routing strategy that guides future routing. We provide theoretical guarantees demonstrating that our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $1 - o(1)$ under natural assumptions, which is further validated by extensive experiments across 3 benchmark datasets and 8 baselines, showing an average improvement of 3.55$\times$ in overall performance, 1.85$\times$ in cost efficiency, and nearly 4.25$\times$ in throughput.

Abstract: This paper provides a self-contained, from-scratch, exposition of key algorithms for instruction tuning of models: SFT, Rejection Sampling, REINFORCE, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Explanations of these algorithms often assume prior knowledge, lack critical details, and/or are overly generalized and complex. Here, each method is discussed and developed step by step using simplified and explicit notation focused on LLMs, aiming to eliminate ambiguity and provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the concepts. By minimizing detours into the broader RL literature and connecting concepts to LLMs, we eliminate superfluous abstractions and reduce cognitive overhead. Following this exposition, we provide a literature review of new techniques and approaches beyond those detailed. Finally, new ideas for research and exploration in the form of GRAPE (Generalized Relative Advantage Policy Evolution) are presented.

<title>Measuring the Measures: Discriminative Capacity of Representational Similarity Metrics Across Model Families</title>

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity. Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families. These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing, recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations, frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and security.

<title>Generating Individual Travel Diaries Using Large Language Models Informed by Census and Land-Use Data</title>

Abstract: This study introduces a Large Language Model (LLM) scheme for generating individual travel diaries in agent-based transportation models. While traditional approaches rely on large quantities of proprietary household travel surveys, the method presented in this study generates personas stochastically from open-source American Community Survey (ACS) and Smart Location Database (SLD) data, then synthesizes diaries through direct prompting. This study features a novel one-to-cohort realism score: a composite of four metrics (Trip Count Score, Interval Score, Purpose Score, and Mode Score) validated against the Connecticut Statewide Transportation Study (CSTS) diaries, matched across demographic variables. The validation utilizes Jensen-Shannon Divergence to measure distributional similarities between generated and real diaries. When compared to diaries generated with classical methods (Negative Binomial for trip generation; Multinomial Logit for mode/purpose) calibrated on the validation set, LLM-generated diaries achieve comparable overall realism (LLM mean: 0.485 vs. 0.455). The LLM excels in determining trip purpose and demonstrates greater consistency (narrower realism score distribution), while classical models lead in numerical estimates of trip count and activity duration. Aggregate validation confirms the LLM's statistical representativeness (LLM mean: 0.612 vs. 0.435), demonstrating LLM's zero-shot viability and establishing a quantifiable metric of diary realism for future synthetic diary evaluation systems.

<title>Correct-Detect: Balancing Performance and Ambiguity Through the Lens of Coreference Resolution in LLMs</title>

arXiv:2509.14456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are intended to reflect human linguistic competencies. But humans have access to a broad and embodied context, which is key in detecting and resolving linguistic ambiguities, even in isolated text spans. A foundational case of semantic ambiguity is found in the task of coreference resolution: how is a pronoun related to an earlier person mention? This capability is implicit in nearly every downstream task, and the presence of ambiguity at this level can alter performance significantly. We show that LLMs can achieve good performance with minimal prompting in both coreference disambiguation and the detection of ambiguity in coreference, however, they cannot do both at the same time. We present the CORRECT-DETECT trade-off: though models have both capabilities and deploy them implicitly, successful performance balancing these two abilities remains elusive.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models such as BERT have become foundational in NLP, yet their performance degrades in specialized domains like patents, which contain long, technical, and legally structured text. Prior approaches to patent NLP have primarily relied on fine-tuning general-purpose models or domain-adapted variants pretrained with limited data. In this work, we pretrain 3 domain-specific masked language models for patents, using the ModernBERT architecture and a curated corpus of over 60 million patent records. Our approach incorporates architectural optimizations, including FlashAttention, rotary embeddings, and GLU feed-forward layers. We evaluate our models on four downstream patent classification tasks. Our model, ModernBERT-base-PT, consistently outperforms the general-purpose ModernBERT baseline on three out of four datasets and achieves competitive performance with a baseline PatentBERT. Additional experiments with ModernBERT-base-VX and Mosaic-BERT-large demonstrate that scaling the model size and customizing the tokenizer further enhance performance on selected tasks. Notably, all ModernBERT variants retain substantially faster inference over - 3x that of PatentBERT - underscoring their suitability for time-sensitive applications. These results underscore the benefits of domain-specific pretraining and architectural improvements for patent-focused NLP tasks.

Abstract: Modern foundational models increasingly reflect not just world knowledge, but patterns of human preference embedded in their training data. We hypothesize that recursive alignment-via human feedback and model-generated corpora-induces a social desirability bias, nudging models to favor agreeable or flattering responses over objective reasoning. We refer to it as the Narcissus Hypothesis and test it across 31 models using standardized personality assessments and a novel Social Desirability Bias score. Results reveal a significant drift toward socially conforming traits, with profound implications for corpus integrity and the reliability of downstream inferences. We then offer a novel epistemological interpretation, tracing how recursive bias may collapse higher-order reasoning down Pearl's Ladder of Causality, culminating in what we refer to as the Rung of Illusion.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated their remarkable success as general-purpose multi-modal assistants, with particular focuses on holistic image- and video-language understanding. Conversely, less attention has been given to scaling fine-grained pixel-level understanding capabilities, where the models are expected to realize pixel-level alignment between visual signals and language semantics. Some previous studies have applied LMMs to related tasks such as region-level captioning and referring expression segmentation. However, these models are limited to performing either referring or segmentation tasks independently and fail to integrate these fine-grained perception capabilities into visual reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose UniPixel, a large multi-modal model capable of flexibly comprehending visual prompt inputs and generating mask-grounded responses. Our model distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating pixel-level perception with general visual understanding capabilities. Specifically, UniPixel processes visual prompts and generates relevant masks on demand, and performs subsequent reasoning conditioning on these intermediate pointers during inference, thereby enabling fine-grained pixel-level reasoning. The effectiveness of our approach has been verified on 10 benchmarks across a diverse set of tasks, including pixel-level referring/segmentation and object-centric understanding in images/videos. A novel PixelQA task that jointly requires referring, segmentation, and question answering is also designed to verify the flexibility of our method.

<title>A Generalized Bisimulation Metric of State Similarity between Markov Decision Processes: From Theoretical Propositions to Applications</title>

arXiv:2509.18714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for computing state similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based computer-use agents represent a convergence of AI and OS capabilities, enabling natural language to control system- and application-level functions. However, due to LLMs' inherent uncertainty issues, granting agents control over computers poses significant security risks. When agent actions deviate from user intentions, they can cause irreversible consequences. Existing mitigation approaches, such as user confirmation and LLM-based dynamic action validation, still suffer from limitations in usability, security, and performance. To address these challenges, we propose CSAgent, a system-level, static policy-based access control framework for computer-use agents. To bridge the gap between static policy and dynamic context and user intent, CSAgent introduces intent- and context-aware policies, and provides an automated toolchain to assist developers in constructing and refining them. CSAgent enforces these policies through an optimized OS service, ensuring that agent actions can only be executed under specific user intents and contexts. CSAgent supports protecting agents that control computers through diverse interfaces, including API, CLI, and GUI. We implement and evaluate CSAgent, which successfully defends against more than 99.36% of attacks while introducing only 6.83% performance overhead.

Abstract: Identifying DNA- (DBPs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is crucial for the understanding of cell function, molecular interactions as well as regulatory functions. Owing to their high similarity, most of the existing approaches face challenges in differentiating between DBPs and RBPs leading to high cross-prediction errors. Moreover, identifying proteins which bind to both DNA and RNA (DRBPs) is also quite a challenging task. In this regard, we propose a novel framework viz. LAMP-PRo which is based on pre-trained protein language model (PLM), attention mechanisms and multi-label learning to mitigate these issues. First, pre-trained PLM such ESM-2 is used for embedding the protein sequences followed by convolutional neural network (CNN). Subsequently multi-head self-attention mechanism is applied for the contextual information while label-aware attention is used to compute class-specific representations by attending to the sequence in a way that is tailored to each label (DBP, RBP and non-NABP) in a multi-label setup. We have also included a novel cross-label attention mechanism to explicitly capture dependencies between DNA- and RNA-binding proteins, enabling more accurate prediction of DRBP. Finally, a linear layer followed by a sigmoid function are used for the final prediction. Extensive experiments are carried out to compare LAMP-PRo with the existing methods wherein the proposed model shows consistent competent performance. Furthermore, we also provide visualization to showcase model interpretability, highlighting which parts of the sequence are most relevant for a predicted label. The original datasets are available at http://bliulab.net/iDRBP\_MMC and the codes are available at https://github.com/NimishaGhosh/LAMP-PRo.

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential grounding.

Abstract: Astronomical image interpretation presents a significant challenge for applying multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to specialized scientific tasks. Existing benchmarks focus on general multimodal capabilities but fail to capture the complexity of astronomical data. To bridge this gap, we introduce AstroMMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in astronomical image understanding. AstroMMBench comprises 621 multiple-choice questions across six astrophysical subfields, curated and reviewed by 15 domain experts for quality and relevance. We conducted an extensive evaluation of 25 diverse MLLMs, including 22 open-source and 3 closed-source models, using AstroMMBench. The results show that Ovis2-34B achieved the highest overall accuracy (70.5%), demonstrating leading capabilities even compared to strong closed-source models. Performance showed variations across the six astrophysical subfields, proving particularly challenging in domains like cosmology and high-energy astrophysics, while models performed relatively better in others, such as instrumentation and solar astrophysics. These findings underscore the vital role of domain-specific benchmarks like AstroMMBench in critically evaluating MLLM performance and guiding their targeted development for scientific applications. AstroMMBench provides a foundational resource and a dynamic tool to catalyze advancements at the intersection of AI and astronomy.

Abstract: Modern legislative frameworks, such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often involve complex webs of agencies, mandates, and interdependencies. Government issued charts attempt to depict these structures but are typically static, dense, and difficult to interpret - even for experts. We introduce LegiScout, an interactive visualization system that transforms static policy diagrams into dynamic, force-directed graphs, enhancing comprehension while preserving essential relationships. By integrating data extraction, natural language processing, and computer vision techniques, LegiScout supports deeper exploration of not only the ACA but also a wide range of legislative and regulatory frameworks. Our approach enables stakeholders - policymakers, analysts, and the public - to navigate and understand the complexity inherent in modern law.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing but remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, especially multi-turn jailbreaks that distribute malicious intent across benign exchanges and bypass alignment mechanisms. Existing approaches often explore the adversarial space poorly, rely on hand-crafted heuristics, or lack systematic query refinement. We present NEXUS (Network Exploration for eXploiting Unsafe Sequences), a modular framework for constructing, refining, and executing optimized multi-turn attacks. NEXUS comprises: (1) ThoughtNet, which hierarchically expands a harmful intent into a structured semantic network of topics, entities, and query chains; (2) a feedback-driven Simulator that iteratively refines and prunes these chains through attacker-victim-judge LLM collaboration using harmfulness and semantic-similarity benchmarks; and (3) a Network Traverser that adaptively navigates the refined query space for real-time attacks. This pipeline uncovers stealthy, high-success adversarial paths across LLMs. On several closed-source and open-source LLMs, NEXUS increases attack success rate by 2.1% to 19.4% over prior methods.

Abstract: This study evaluates whether integrating curriculum learning with diffusion-based synthetic augmentation can enhance the detection of difficult pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs, particularly those with low size, brightness, and contrast, which often challenge conventional AI models due to data imbalance and limited annotation. A Faster R-CNN with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) backbone was trained on a hybrid dataset comprising expert-labeled NODE21 (1,213 patients; 52.4 percent male; mean age 63.2 +/- 11.5 years), VinDr-CXR, CheXpert, and 11,206 DDPM-generated synthetic images. Difficulty scores based on size, brightness, and contrast guided curriculum learning. Performance was compared to a non-curriculum baseline using mean average precision (mAP), Dice score, and area under the curve (AUC). Statistical tests included bootstrapped confidence intervals, DeLong tests, and paired t-tests. The curriculum model achieved a mean AUC of 0.95 versus 0.89 for the baseline (p < 0.001), with improvements in sensitivity (70 percent vs. 48 percent) and accuracy (82 percent vs. 70 percent). Stratified analysis demonstrated consistent gains across all difficulty bins (Easy to Very Hard). Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed more anatomically focused attention under curriculum learning. These results suggest that curriculum-guided synthetic augmentation enhances model robustness and generalization for pulmonary nodule detection.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability, conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models (ORMs) that judge only final answers. Process Reward Models(PRMs) address this gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text, multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future research toward fine-grained, robust reasoning alignment.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of 11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA, MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/MATRIX.

<title>Lightweight Baselines for Medical Abstract Classification: DistilBERT with Cross-Entropy as a Strong Default</title>

Abstract: The research evaluates lightweight medical abstract classification methods to establish their maximum performance capabilities under financial budget restrictions. On the public medical abstracts corpus, we finetune BERT base and Distil BERT with three objectives cross entropy (CE), class weighted CE, and focal loss under identical tokenization, sequence length, optimizer, and schedule. DistilBERT with plain CE gives the strongest raw argmax trade off, while a post hoc operating point selection (validation calibrated, classwise thresholds) sub stantially improves deployed performance; under this tuned regime, focal benefits most. We report Accuracy, Macro F1, and WeightedF1, release evaluation artifacts, and include confusion analyses to clarify error structure. The practical takeaway is to start with a compact encoder and CE, then add lightweight calibration or thresholding when deployment requires higher macro balance.

<title>Is Implicit Knowledge Enough for LLMs? A RAG Approach for Tree-based Structures</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting with structured data like code files, another popular method, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data, particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.

<title>Stabilizing MoE Reinforcement Learning by Aligning Training and Inference Routers</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions, the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.

<title>A$^2$FM: An Adaptive Agent Foundation Model for Tool-Aware Hybrid Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2510.12838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models split into two families: reasoning-centric LLMs, which strengthen internal chain-of-thought reasoning but cannot invoke external tools, and agentic LLMs, which learn to interact with environments and leverage tools but often lag in deep reasoning. This divide arises from fundamentally different training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency on simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In this work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A$^2$FM), a unified framework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first learns task-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a shared backbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third mode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary reasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To jointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy Optimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a cost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A$^2$FM achieves 13.4% on BrowseComp, 70.4% on AIME25, and 16.7% on HLE, setting new SOTA among comparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across agentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks. Notably, the adaptive execution achieves a cost of pass of only $0.00487 per correct answer-cutting cost by 45.2% relative to reasoning and 33.5% relative to agentic, thus delivering substantially higher cost efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness; and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

<div> Keywords: Deep metric learning, Quantum Metric Learning, Parameterized Quantum Circuit, NISQ devices, Quantum Polar Metric Learning

Summary:
Quantum Polar Metric Learning (QPMeL) is proposed as a method to improve deep metric learning on quantum computers. QPMeL combines classical model learning with a shallow Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) using Ry and Rz gates to create better separation in Hilbert Space. The approach uses a trainable layer of ZZ(θ)-gates to learn entanglement and incorporates a Fidelity Triplet Loss function to train both classical and quantum components. Compared to Quantum Metric Learning (QMeL) on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, QPMeL achieves 3X better multi-class separation while using only half the number of gates and depth. Furthermore, QPMeL outperforms classical networks with similar configurations, showing promise for future research on fully classical models with quantum loss functions.

Abstract: Deep metric learning has recently shown extremely promising results in the classical data domain, creating well-separated feature spaces. This idea was also adapted to quantum computers via Quantum Metric Learning(QMeL). QMeL consists of a 2-step process with a classical model to compress the data to fit into the limited number of qubits, then train a Parameterized Quantum Circuit(PQC) to create better separation in Hilbert Space. However, on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QMeL solutions result in high circuit width and depth, both of which limit scalability. We propose Quantum Polar Metric Learning (QPMeL) that uses a classical model to learn the parameters of the polar form of a qubit. We then utilize a shallow PQC with $R_y$ and $R_z$ gates to create the state and a trainable layer of $ZZ(\theta)$-gates to learn entanglement. The circuit also computes fidelity via a SWAP Test for our proposed Fidelity Triplet Loss function, used to train both classical and quantum components. When compared to QMeL approaches, QPMeL achieves 3X better multi-class separation, while using only 1/2 the number of gates and depth. We also demonstrate that QPMeL outperforms classical networks with similar configurations, presenting a promising avenue for future research on fully classical models with quantum loss functions.

Abstract: Although graph-based learning has attracted a lot of attention, graph representation learning is still a challenging task whose resolution may impact key application fields such as chemistry or biology. To this end, we introduce GRALE, a novel graph autoencoder that encodes and decodes graphs of varying sizes into a shared embedding space. GRALE is trained using an Optimal Transport-inspired loss that compares the original and reconstructed graphs and leverages a differentiable node matching module, which is trained jointly with the encoder and decoder. The proposed attention-based architecture relies on Evoformer, the core component of AlphaFold, which we extend to support both graph encoding and decoding. We show, in numerical experiments on simulated and molecular data, that GRALE enables a highly general form of pre-training, applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks, from classification and regression to more complex tasks such as graph interpolation, editing, matching, and prediction.

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents now operate across cloud, enterprise, and decentralized domains, creating demand for registry infrastructures that enable trustworthy discovery, capability negotiation, and identity assurance. We analyze five prominent approaches: (1) MCP Registry (centralized publication of mcp.json descriptors), (2) A2A Agent Cards (decentralized self-describing JSON capability manifests), (3) AGNTCY Agent Directory Service (IPFS Kademlia DHT content routing extended for semantic taxonomy-based content discovery, OCI artifact storage, and Sigstore-backed integrity), (4) Microsoft Entra Agent ID (enterprise SaaS directory with policy and zero-trust integration), and (5) NANDA Index AgentFacts (cryptographically verifiable, privacy-preserving fact model with credentialed assertions). Using four evaluation dimensions: security, authentication, scalability, and maintainability, we surface architectural trade-offs between centralized control, enterprise governance, and distributed resilience. We conclude with design recommendations for an emerging Internet of AI Agents requiring verifiable identity, adaptive discovery flows, and interoperable capability semantics.

arXiv:2509.18355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving high performance, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness while maintaining architectural flexibility is a critical challenge in the development and deployment of edge AI devices. Monolithic SoC designs struggle with this complex balance mainly due to low manufacturing yields (below 16%) at advanced 360 mm^2 process nodes. This paper presents a novel chiplet-based RISC-V SoC architecture that addresses these limitations through modular AI acceleration and intelligent system level optimization. Our proposed design integrates 4 different key innovations in a 30mm x 30mm silicon interposer: adaptive cross-chiplet Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS); AI-aware Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) protocol extensions featuring streaming flow control units and compression-aware transfers; distributed cryptographic security across heterogeneous chiplets; and intelligent sensor-driven load migration. The proposed architecture integrates a 7nm RISC-V CPU chiplet with dual 5nm AI accelerators (15 TOPS INT8 each), 16GB HBM3 memory stacks, and dedicated power management controllers. Experimental results across industry standard benchmarks like MobileNetV2, ResNet-50 and real-time video processing demonstrate significant performance improvements. The AI-optimized configuration achieves ~14.7% latency reduction, 17.3% throughput improvement, and 16.2% power reduction compared to previous basic chiplet implementations. These improvements collectively translate to a 40.1% efficiency gain corresponding to ~3.5 mJ per MobileNetV2 inference (860 mW/244 images/s), while maintaining sub-5ms real-time capability across all experimented workloads. These performance upgrades demonstrate that modular chiplet designs can achieve near-monolithic computational density while enabling cost efficiency, scalability and upgradeability, crucial for next-generation edge AI device applications.

Abstract: Aging is a highly complex and heterogeneous process that progresses at different rates across individuals, making biological age (BA) a more accurate indicator of physiological decline than chronological age. While previous studies have built aging clocks using single-omics data, they often fail to capture the full molecular complexity of human aging. In this work, we leveraged the Human Phenotype Project, a large-scale cohort of 12,000 adults aged 30--70 years, with extensive longitudinal profiling that includes clinical, behavioral, environmental, and multi-omics datasets -- spanning transcriptomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and the microbiome. By employing advanced machine learning frameworks capable of modeling nonlinear biological dynamics, we developed and rigorously validated a multi-omics aging clock that robustly predicts diverse health outcomes and future disease risk. Unsupervised clustering of the integrated molecular profiles from multi-omics uncovered distinct biological subtypes of aging, revealing striking heterogeneity in aging trajectories and pinpointing pathway-specific alterations associated with different aging patterns. These findings demonstrate the power of multi-omics integration to decode the molecular landscape of aging and lay the groundwork for personalized healthspan monitoring and precision strategies to prevent age-related diseases.

Summary:
The study focuses on the evaluation of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning capabilities in solving mathematical extremal problems. They introduce ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset consisting of standardized extrema-finding problems sourced from Chinese Mathematical Olympiad exercises. The evaluation is conducted on various state-of-the-art LLM model families like Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. The results show that LLMs' extremal-solving abilities do not always align with existing mathematical benchmarks like AIME25 and MATH-500. Some models exhibit strong general mathematical reasoning but weak extremal-solving skills, indicating a gap in current evaluation practices. This suggests that current benchmarks may not fully capture the spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers. However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e. finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems, curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills, and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

<div> evaluate, language models, human intent, consumer, benchmark
<br />
Understanding human intent in public discussions is a challenging task for large language models (LLMs), requiring analytical reasoning, contextual interpretation, and decision-making under uncertainty. These discussions are complex, involving diverse perspectives, conflicting goals, emotional tendencies, and implicit assumptions. To accurately interpret human intent, LLMs need to integrate multiple signals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs lack real-world public discussion data. To address this gap, the authors introduce IntendEval, a dynamic benchmark designed for evaluating intent understanding, especially in consumer discussions. IntendEval is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind, supporting real-time updates and preventing data contamination through an automated curation pipeline.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding human intent is a complex, high-level task for large language models (LLMs), requiring analytical reasoning, contextual interpretation, dynamic information aggregation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Real-world public discussions, such as consumer product discussions, are rarely linear or involve a single user. Instead, they are characterized by interwoven and often conflicting perspectives, divergent concerns, goals, emotional tendencies, as well as implicit assumptions and background knowledge about usage scenarios. To accurately understand such explicit public intent, an LLM must go beyond parsing individual sentences; it must integrate multi-source signals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse, similar to how experts in fields like politics, economics, or finance approach complex, uncertain environments. Despite the importance of this capability, no large-scale benchmark currently exists for evaluating LLMs on real-world human intent understanding, primarily due to the challenges of collecting real-world public discussion data and constructing a robust evaluation pipeline. To bridge this gap, we introduce \bench, the first dynamic, live evaluation benchmark specifically designed for intent understanding, particularly in the consumer domain. \bench is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind, supporting real-time updates while preventing data contamination through an automated curation pipeline.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities for cre- ating dynamic non-player characters (NPCs) in gaming environments, enabling both func- tional task execution and persona-consistent dialogue generation. In this paper, we (Tu_Character_lab) report our participation in the Commonsense Persona-Grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025 Round 2, which eval- uates agents across three tracks: task-oriented dialogue, context-aware dialogue, and their integration. Our approach combines two complementary strategies: (i) lightweight prompting techniques in the API track, including a Deflanderization prompting method to suppress excessive role-play and improve task fidelity, and (ii) fine-tuned large models in the GPU track, leveraging Qwen3-14B with supervisedfinetuning (SFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA). Our best submissions ranked 2nd on Task 1, 2nd on Task 3 (API track), and 4th on Task 3 (GPU track).

<div> Keywords: humanoid locomotion, layered control architecture, perception, robustness, proprioceptive stabilizer

Summary: 
This study focuses on developing a layered control architecture (LCA) for robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments. The approach involves a fast proprioceptive stabilizer operating at a high rate, combined with a slower perceptual policy for decision-making. By utilizing a two-stage training curriculum, starting with blind stabilizer pretraining and then fine-tuning the perceptual policy, the LCA consistently outperforms one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware experiments. The results demonstrate superior performance on challenging tasks such as stairs and ledges compared to monolithic end-to-end designs. The key advantage of the LCA lies in the architectural separation of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity. This approach showcases the importance of balancing fast stabilization with slower perceptual decision-making for achieving robust perception-conditioned locomotion in humanoid robots.

arXiv:2510.14947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than monolithic end-to-end designs, even when using minimal perception encoders. Through a two-stage training curriculum (blind stabilizer pretraining followed by perceptual fine-tuning), we demonstrate that layered policies consistently outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. On a Unitree G1 humanoid, our approach succeeds across stair and ledge tasks where one-stage perceptual policies fail. These results highlight that architectural separation of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for robust perception-conditioned locomotion.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement learning, Control Barrier Functions, Safety, Policy training, Robotics

Summary: Control Barrier Functions (CBF) are used in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to ensure safety during training by modifying the policy to encode safety constraints with a CBF term and filtering policy rollouts for safety. Continuous-time safety filters can be deployed through closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. The framework, CBF-RL, internalizes safety constraints in the learned policy, leading to safer actions, biasing towards safer rewards, and eliminating the need for an online safety filter during deployment. Ablation studies on navigation tasks and a humanoid robot validate CBF-RL, showing safer exploration, faster convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty. The humanoid robot successfully avoids obstacles and climbs stairs safely in real-world settings using CBF-RL. <br /><br />Summary: Reinforcement Learning combined with Control Barrier Functions in CBF-RL ensures safe policy training, internalizes safety constraints in the learned policy, and eliminates the need for online safety filters during deployment.

arXiv:2510.14959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally deployed online via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior, the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs in training. CBF-RL has two key attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically, we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards -- enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without a runtime safety filter.

Summary: VisuoAlign is a new framework designed to enhance the safety alignment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by incorporating safety constraints into the reasoning process using visual-textual interactive prompts. By employing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), the framework constructs diverse safety-critical prompt trajectories to proactively detect risks and ensure compliant responses in real-time. It addresses vulnerabilities in LVLMs by introducing prompt-based scaling, enabling comprehensive dataset generation, and improving robustness against complex cross-modal threats. Through extensive experiments, VisuoAlign demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing safety alignment, exposing risks, and improving the overall security of LVLMs in multimodal tasks. <div>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal perception and generation, yet their safety alignment remains a critical challenge.Existing defenses and vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaks, as visual inputs introduce new attack surfaces, reasoning chains lack safety supervision, and alignment often degrades under modality fusion.To overcome these limitation, we propose VisuoAlign, a framework for multi-modal safety alignment via prompt-guided tree search.VisuoAlign embeds safety constrains into the reasoning process through visual-textual interactive prompts, employs Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) to systematically construct diverse safety-critical prompt trajectories, and introduces prompt-based scaling to ensure real-time risk detection and compliant responses.Extensive experiments demonstrate that VisuoAlign proactively exposes risks, enables comprehensive dataset generation, and significantly improves the robustness of LVLMs against complex cross-modal threats.

<div> Keywords: large language models, epistemic architecture, Structured Cognitive Loop, philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence

Summary: 
- The paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable epistemological framework for emergent intelligence.
- SCL focuses on understanding the conditions under which cognition emerges, rather than defining intelligence ontologically.
- Intelligence is defined as a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action, and regulation, not just representational accuracy.
- SCL operationalizes philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, allowing for "executable epistemology."
- Functional separation within cognitive architecture leads to more coherent behavior compared to monolithic prompt-based systems.
- The framework grounds behavior in epistemic structure rather than statistical regularity in AI.
- It redefines knowledge as continuous reconstruction within a coherent loop, impacting philosophy of mind, epistemology, and AI.
- SCL contributes to debates on cognitive phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, advocating for structural realization of cognitive principles. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models exhibit intelligence without genuine epistemic understanding, exposing a key gap: the absence of epistemic architecture. This paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable epistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI research asking "what is intelligence?" (ontological), SCL asks "under what conditions does cognition emerge?" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of mind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and implementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and extended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a performed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action, and regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling "executable epistemology" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it shows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems, supported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not representational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic state through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of mind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to be enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure rather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not as truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a phenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real progress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive principles structurally.

Abstract: Citiverses hold the potential to support regulatory learning by offering immersive, virtual environments for experimenting with policy scenarios and technologies. This paper proposes a science-for-policy agenda to explore the potential of citiverses as experimentation spaces for regulatory learning, grounded in a consultation with a high-level panel of experts, including policymakers from the European Commission, national government science advisers and leading researchers in digital regulation and virtual worlds. It identifies key research areas, including scalability, real-time feedback, complexity modelling, cross-border collaboration, risk reduction, citizen participation, ethical considerations and the integration of emerging technologies. In addition, the paper analyses a set of experimental topics, spanning transportation, urban planning and the environment/climate crisis, that could be tested in citiverse platforms to advance regulatory learning in these areas. The proposed work is designed to inform future research for policy and emphasizes a responsible approach to developing and using citiverses. It prioritizes careful consideration of the ethical, economic, ecological and social dimensions of different regulations. The paper also explores essential preliminary steps necessary for integrating citiverses into the broader ecosystems of experimentation spaces, including test beds, living labs and regulatory sandboxes

Memory systems are crucial for AI agents, yet current approaches often lack adaptability and fail to recognize the task-oriented nature of agent memory. Inspired by Piaget's cognitive development theory, the authors propose PISA—a novel, unified memory system that treats memory as a dynamic and evolving process. PISA introduces a trimodal adaptation mechanism that enables continuous learning through schema updation, evolution, and creation, ensuring coherent memory organization while facilitating flexible updates. Additionally, a hybrid memory access architecture combining symbolic reasoning with neural retrieval enhances retrieval accuracy and efficiency. Empirical evaluations on LOCOMO and AggQA benchmarks demonstrate that PISA achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving adaptability and long-term knowledge retention in AI agents.  <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Memory systems are fundamental to AI agents, yet existing work often lacks adaptability to diverse tasks and overlooks the constructive and task-oriented role of AI agent memory. Drawing from Piaget's theory of cognitive development, we propose PISA, a pragmatic, psych-inspired unified memory system that addresses these limitations by treating memory as a constructive and adaptive process. To enable continuous learning and adaptability, PISA introduces a trimodal adaptation mechanism (i.e., schema updation, schema evolution, and schema creation) that preserves coherent organization while supporting flexible memory updates. Building on these schema-grounded structures, we further design a hybrid memory access architecture that seamlessly integrates symbolic reasoning with neural retrieval, significantly improving retrieval accuracy and efficiency. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on the existing LOCOMO benchmark and our newly proposed AggQA benchmark for data analysis tasks, confirms that PISA sets a new state-of-the-art by significantly enhancing adaptability and long-term knowledge retention.

<div> Keywords: Large Reasoning Models, Collapse in Performance, Tower of Hanoi, Environment Interface, Policy Analysis

Summary:
The study examines the performance of large language models (LLMs) in solving Tower of Hanoi problems and whether providing an environment interface affects their performance. The results show that access to an environment interface does not prevent performance collapse in LLMs. Analysis of LLM-parameterized policies indicates increasing divergence from optimal and random policies, suggesting a mode-like collapse at each complexity level. The model's performance depends on whether the mode it reflects is the correct solution. This phenomenon could also occur in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). These findings highlight the importance of understanding how models interact with their environment and the potential challenges in evaluating reasoning abilities in artificial intelligence systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work reports that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) undergo a collapse in performance on solving puzzles beyond certain perplexity thresholds. In subsequent discourse, questions have arisen as to whether the nature of the task muddles an evaluation of true reasoning. One potential confound is the requirement that the model keep track of the state space on its own. We provide a large language model (LLM) with an environment interface for Tower of Hanoi problems, allowing it to make a move with a tool call, provide written justification, observe the resulting state space, and reprompt itself for the next move. We observe that access to an environment interface does not delay or eradicate performance collapse. Furthermore, LLM-parameterized policy analysis reveals increasing divergence from both optimal policies and uniformly random policies, suggesting that the model exhibits mode-like collapse at each level of complexity, and that performance is dependent upon whether the mode reflects the correct solution for the problem. We suggest that a similar phenomena might take place in LRMs.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Cognitive Load Traces (CLTs) as a framework for interpreting deep models, drawing inspiration from Cognitive Load Theory in human cognition. CLTs are represented as a stochastic process involving Intrinsic, Extraneous, and Germane load components, measured through proxies like attention entropy, representation dispersion, and decoding stability. Symbolic formulations and visualization methods are proposed for analyzing reasoning dynamics. Experimental results on reasoning and planning tasks demonstrate that CLTs can predict error onset, uncover cognitive strategies, and enable interventions to improve reasoning efficiency by up to 30% without sacrificing accuracy. This framework offers insights into model internal resource allocation, enhancing model interpretability and performance. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We propose \textbf{Cognitive Load Traces} (CLTs) as a mid-level interpretability framework for deep models, inspired by Cognitive Load Theory in human cognition. CLTs are defined as symbolic, temporally varying functions that quantify model-internal resource allocation. Formally, we represent CLTs as a three-component stochastic process $(\mathrm{IL}_t, \mathrm{EL}_t, \mathrm{GL}_t)$, corresponding to \emph{Intrinsic}, \emph{Extraneous}, and \emph{Germane} load. Each component is instantiated through measurable proxies such as attention entropy, KV-cache miss ratio, representation dispersion, and decoding stability. We propose both symbolic formulations and visualization methods (load curves, simplex diagrams) that enable interpretable analysis of reasoning dynamics. Experiments on reasoning and planning benchmarks show that CLTs predict error-onset, reveal cognitive strategies, and enable load-guided interventions that improve reasoning efficiency by 15-30\% while maintaining accuracy.

Summary: 
ProofFlow introduces a new pipeline for proof autoformalization that prioritizes structural fidelity in translating natural language theorems and proofs into machine-verifiable code. It first constructs a directed acyclic graph to map logical dependencies between proof steps and then formalizes each step as an intermediate lemma to preserve the original argument's logical structure. A new benchmark of 184 undergraduate-level problems, annotated with solutions and dependency graphs, is presented for evaluation. A composite metric called ProofScore is introduced to assess syntactic correctness, semantic faithfulness, and structural fidelity. Experimental results show the pipeline outperforms baselines like full-proof formalization and step-proof formalization, achieving a ProofScore of 0.545. The pipeline, benchmark, and metric are open-sourced to promote further advancements in the field.

arXiv:2510.15981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proof autoformalization, the task of translating natural language theorems and proofs into machine-verifiable code, is a critical step for integrating large language models into rigorous mathematical workflows. Current approaches focus on producing executable code, but they frequently fail to preserve the semantic meaning and logical structure of the original human-written argument. To address this, we introduce ProofFlow, a novel pipeline that treats structural fidelity as a primary objective. ProofFlow first constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to map the logical dependencies between proof steps. Then, it employs a novel lemma-based approach to systematically formalize each step as an intermediate lemma, preserving the logical structure of the original argument. To facilitate evaluation, we present a new benchmark of 184 undergraduate-level problems, manually annotated with step-by-step solutions and logical dependency graphs, and introduce ProofScore, a new composite metric to evaluate syntactic correctness, semantic faithfulness, and structural fidelity. Experimental results show our pipeline sets a new state-of-the-art for autoformalization, achieving a ProofScore of 0.545, substantially exceeding baselines like full-proof formalization (0.123), which processes the entire proof at once, and step-proof formalization (0.072), which handles each step independently. Our pipeline, benchmark, and score metric are open-sourced to encourage further progress at https://github.com/Huawei-AI4Math/ProofFlow.

Summary:<br />
Random permutation set (RPS) introduces a new approach for handling uncertainty with order information. This paper analyzes conflicts in RPS through the perspectives of random finite set (RFS) and Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). By defining an inconsistency measure between permutations and proposing a non-overlap-based conflict measure method, the paper extends DST to RPS theory (RPST). The order information in focal sets highlights qualitative propensity, with top-ranked elements carrying more weight. The proposed conflict measure exhibits top-weightedness and flexibility in parameter selection. Numerical examples illustrate the efficacy of the method in measuring conflicts between RPSs. This study contributes to advancing the understanding and application of conflict measurement in order-structured uncertain information fusion.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.16001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a new formalism for reasoning with uncertainty involving order information. Measuring the conflict between two pieces of evidence represented by permutation mass functions remains an urgent research topic in order-structured uncertain information fusion. In this paper, a detailed analysis of conflicts in RPS is carried out from two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). Starting from the observation of permutations, we first define an inconsistency measure between permutations inspired by the rank-biased overlap(RBO) measure and further propose a non-overlap-based conflict measure method for RPSs. This paper regards RPS theory (RPST) as an extension of DST. The order information newly added in focal sets indicates qualitative propensity, characterized by top-ranked elements occupying a more critical position. Some numerical examples are used to demonstrate the behavior and properties of the proposed conflict measure. The proposed method not only has the natural top-weightedness property and can effectively measure the conflict between RPSs from the DST view but also provides decision-makers with a flexible selection of weights, parameters, and truncated depths.

<div> surrogates, neural, dynamical systems, measurements, PAINT <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces the concept of Neural Twins as an evolution of neural surrogates to create digital replicas of real systems. Neural Twins update their state based on measurements at test time for context-specific decision-making. The Parallel-in-time Neural Twins (PAINT) method is proposed as an architecture-agnostic approach to modeling dynamical systems from measurements by training a generative neural network to model state distributions parallel over time. The theoretical analysis shows that PAINT remains on-trajectory, unlike autoregressive models. Empirical evaluation on a turbulent fluid dynamics problem demonstrates PAINT's ability to predict system states accurately from sparse measurements. This highlights PAINT's potential for developing neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enhancing state estimation and decision-making capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems, while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state, thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. A critical property of neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins (PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model the distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation and decision-making.

<div> Keywords: transfer fault diagnosis, industrial environments, adversarial network, noise interference, domain shifts <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces ISGFAN, an information separation global-focal adversarial network designed for robust fault diagnosis in industrial settings with high noise levels and domain shifts. Existing methods often struggle in such conditions due to assumptions of clean data or domain similarity. ISGFAN addresses this challenge by utilizing an information separation architecture that combines adversarial learning with an improved orthogonal loss to isolate noise interference and domain-specific features. The framework includes a global-focal domain-adversarial scheme to enhance transfer robustness by aligning both conditional and marginal distributions. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets showcase ISGFAN's superior performance compared to other approaches. The availability of data and code on GitHub further supports the effectiveness and reproducibility of the proposed method. <div>

Abstract: Existing transfer fault diagnosis methods typically assume either clean data or sufficient domain similarity, which limits their effectiveness in industrial environments where severe noise interference and domain shifts coexist. To address this challenge, we propose an information separation global-focal adversarial network (ISGFAN), a robust framework for cross-domain fault diagnosis under noise conditions. ISGFAN is built on an information separation architecture that integrates adversarial learning with an improved orthogonal loss to decouple domain-invariant fault representation, thereby isolating noise interference and domain-specific characteristics. To further strengthen transfer robustness, ISGFAN employs a global-focal domain-adversarial scheme that constrains both the conditional and marginal distributions of the model. Specifically, the focal domain-adversarial component mitigates category-specific transfer obstacles caused by noise in unsupervised scenarios, while the global domain classifier ensures alignment of the overall distribution. Experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other prominent existing approaches, confirming the superiority of the ISGFAN framework.

<div> CP model, flexible job-shop, deadline tasks, Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty, dynamic controllability 

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach that combines offline constraint-programming (CP) optimization with online temporal-network execution to create robust schedules for modern manufacturing systems facing stochastic task durations. By incorporating optimal buffers into the CP model and translating the plan into a Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty, the proposed method guarantees dynamic controllability, allowing real-time adjustments to prevent deadline violations. Monte-Carlo simulations on benchmark suites demonstrate significant improvements over existing meta-heuristic schedules, with a complete elimination of deadline violations and minimal impact on makespan. Scalability experiments confirm the efficiency of the approach on medium-size instances, showcasing its potential to enhance manufacturing operations and move towards self-correcting factories.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Modern manufacturing systems must meet hard delivery deadlines while coping with stochastic task durations caused by process noise, equipment variability, and human intervention. Traditional deterministic schedules break down when reality deviates from nominal plans, triggering costly last-minute repairs. This thesis combines offline constraint-programming (CP) optimisation with online temporal-network execution to create schedules that remain feasible under worst-case uncertainty. First, we build a CP model of the flexible job-shop with per-job deadline tasks and insert an optimal buffer $\Delta^*$ to obtain a fully pro-active baseline. We then translate the resulting plan into a Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) and verify dynamic controllability, which guarantees that a real-time dispatcher can retime activities for every bounded duration realisation without violating resource or deadline constraints. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the open Kacem~1--4 benchmark suite show that our hybrid approach eliminates 100\% of deadline violations observed in state-of-the-art meta-heuristic schedules, while adding only 3--5\% makespan overhead. Scalability experiments confirm that CP solve-times and STNU checks remain sub-second on medium-size instances. The work demonstrates how temporal-network reasoning can bridge the gap between proactive buffering and dynamic robustness, moving industry a step closer to truly digital, self-correcting factories.

<div> Generative Models, Clinical Reliability, Prompting Strategies, Assisted Reproductive Technology, Data Scarcity
Summary:
The study evaluates the reliability of Large Language Model-generated clinical Chains-of-Thought (CoTs) for explainable medical Artificial Intelligence (AI). Three prompting strategies were compared by senior clinicians in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) against evaluations from an AI model. The Selective Few-shot strategy outperformed Zero-shot and Random Few-shot strategies significantly. The Random Few-shot strategy showed no improvement over the Zero-shot baseline, highlighting the importance of high-quality examples. The success of the Selective strategy was attributed to "Gold-Standard Depth" and "Representative Diversity" principles. The AI evaluator failed to discern these performance differences, emphasizing the need for strategic prompt curation. A "Dual Principles" framework was proposed to generate trustworthy data at scale, confirming the crucial role of human expertise in evaluating clinical AI.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating high-quality clinical Chains-of-Thought (CoTs) is crucial for explainable medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) while constrained by data scarcity. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can synthesize medical data, their clinical reliability remains unverified. This study evaluates the reliability of LLM-generated CoTs and investigates prompting strategies to enhance their quality. In a blinded comparative study, senior clinicians in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) evaluated CoTs generated via three distinct strategies: Zero-shot, Random Few-shot (using shallow examples), and Selective Few-shot (using diverse, high-quality examples). These expert ratings were compared against evaluations from a state-of-the-art AI model (GPT-4o). The Selective Few-shot strategy significantly outperformed other strategies across all human evaluation metrics (p < .001). Critically, the Random Few-shot strategy offered no significant improvement over the Zero-shot baseline, demonstrating that low-quality examples are as ineffective as no examples. The success of the Selective strategy is attributed to two principles: "Gold-Standard Depth" (reasoning quality) and "Representative Diversity" (generalization). Notably, the AI evaluator failed to discern these critical performance differences. The clinical reliability of synthetic CoTs is dictated by strategic prompt curation, not the mere presence of examples. We propose a "Dual Principles" framework as a foundational methodology to generate trustworthy data at scale. This work offers a validated solution to the data bottleneck and confirms the indispensable role of human expertise in evaluating high-stakes clinical AI.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses the impact of generative AI on corporate responsibility and the traditional notions of mens rea. It argues for redefining corporate knowledge as a dynamic capability based on information-access procedures and output reliability. A formal model is developed to measure corporate knowledge with a continuous metric integrating computational cost and error rate. Thresholded knowledge predicates and epistemic capacity indexes are derived to assess knowledge levels and overall capability. These quantitative metrics are then mapped onto legal standards like actual knowledge and wilful blindness. The study aims to create measurable audit artifacts that make the corporate mind accountable and tractable in the era of algorithms. <div>

Abstract: Corporate responsibility turns on notions of corporate \textit{mens rea}, traditionally imputed from human agents. Yet these assumptions are under challenge as generative AI increasingly mediates enterprise decision-making. Building on the theory of extended cognition, we argue that in response corporate knowledge may be redefined as a dynamic capability, measurable by the efficiency of its information-access procedures and the validated reliability of their outputs. We develop a formal model that captures epistemic states of corporations deploying sophisticated AI or information systems, introducing a continuous organisational knowledge metric $S_S(\varphi)$ which integrates a pipeline's computational cost and its statistically validated error rate. We derive a thresholded knowledge predicate $\mathsf{K}_S$ to impute knowledge and a firm-wide epistemic capacity index $\mathcal{K}_{S,t}$ to measure overall capability. We then operationally map these quantitative metrics onto the legal standards of actual knowledge, constructive knowledge, wilful blindness, and recklessness. Our work provides a pathway towards creating measurable and justiciable audit artefacts, that render the corporate mind tractable and accountable in the algorithmic age.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces TEAM-PHI, a framework for evaluating and selecting protected health information (PHI) de-identification models without heavily relying on expert annotations. It utilizes multiple Evaluation Agents that independently assess PHI extractions, with their results consolidated through a large language model (LLM)-based majority voting mechanism. Experiments on clinical notes show that TEAM-PHI produces consistent and accurate rankings, with LLM-based voting converging on the top-performing systems. Automated rankings closely align with supervised evaluation and human assessment, making TEAM-PHI a practical and cost-effective solution for PHI de-identification model selection when ground-truth labels are limited.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protected health information (PHI) de-identification is critical for enabling the safe reuse of clinical notes, yet evaluating and comparing PHI de-identification models typically depends on costly, small-scale expert annotations. We present TEAM-PHI, a multi-agent evaluation and selection framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically measure de-identification quality and select the best-performing model without heavy reliance on gold labels. TEAM-PHI deploys multiple Evaluation Agents, each independently judging the correctness of PHI extractions and outputting structured metrics. Their results are then consolidated through an LLM-based majority voting mechanism that integrates diverse evaluator perspectives into a single, stable, and reproducible ranking. Experiments on a real-world clinical note corpus demonstrate that TEAM-PHI produces consistent and accurate rankings: despite variation across individual evaluators, LLM-based voting reliably converges on the same top-performing systems. Further comparison with ground-truth annotations and human evaluation confirms that the framework's automated rankings closely match supervised evaluation. By combining independent evaluation agents with LLM majority voting, TEAM-PHI offers a practical, secure, and cost-effective solution for automatic evaluation and best-model selection in PHI de-identification, even when ground-truth labels are limited.

<title>The Right to Be Remembered: Preserving Maximally Truthful Digital Memory in the Age of AI</title>

<div> Keywords: large language models, information retrieval, bias, omission, Right To Be Remembered <br />
Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for information retrieval, providing synthesized responses that may present a single authoritative view. This approach, while convenient, can lead to bias and omission as multiple perspectives are collapsed into one answer. LLMs, controlled by a few vendors, have the power to shape what is remembered and overlooked, potentially amplifying existing biases. The concept of the Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) aims to address these concerns by minimizing the risk of information omission, ensuring fair treatment, and promoting truthful content generation. By safeguarding against the erasure of individuals with limited digital presence and preventing the disproportionate elevation of already prominent narratives, the RTBR seeks to reshape collective memory in a more balanced and inclusive manner.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), people have begun to rely on them for information retrieval. While traditional search engines display ranked lists of sources shaped by search engine optimization (SEO), advertising, and personalization, LLMs typically provide a synthesized response that feels singular and authoritative. While both approaches carry risks of bias and omission, LLMs may amplify the effect by collapsing multiple perspectives into one answer, reducing users ability or inclination to compare alternatives. This concentrates power over information in a few LLM vendors whose systems effectively shape what is remembered and what is overlooked. As a result, certain narratives, individuals or groups, may be disproportionately suppressed, while others are disproportionately elevated. Over time, this creates a new threat: the gradual erasure of those with limited digital presence, and the amplification of those already prominent, reshaping collective memory.To address these concerns, this paper presents a concept of the Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) which encompasses minimizing the risk of AI-driven information omission, embracing the right of fair treatment, while ensuring that the generated content would be maximally truthful.

Abstract: As AI tools become increasingly common for research ideation, robust evaluation is critical to ensure the validity and usefulness of generated ideas. We introduce ScholarEval, a retrieval augmented evaluation framework that assesses research ideas based on two fundamental criteria: soundness - the empirical validity of proposed methods based on existing literature, and contribution - the degree of advancement made by the idea across different dimensions relative to prior research. To evaluate ScholarEval, we introduce ScholarIdeas, the first expert-annotated dataset of multi-domain research ideas and reviews, comprised of 117 ideas across four disciplines: artificial intelligence, neuroscience, biochemistry, and ecology. Our evaluation shows that ScholarEval achieves significantly higher coverage of points mentioned in the human expert annotated rubrics in ScholarIdeas compared to all baselines. Furthermore, ScholarEval is consistently preferred over our strongest baseline o4-mini-deep-research, a reasoning and search-enabled agentic system by OpenAI, in terms of evaluation actionability, depth, and evidence support. Our large-scale user study also shows that ScholarEval significantly outperforms deep research in literature engagement, idea refinement, and usefulness. We openly release our code, dataset, and ScholarEval tool for the community to use and build on.

<br />
Summary: Recent advances in large reasoning models have led to impressive performance in complex tasks. However, a critical vulnerability called reasoning distraction has been identified, where models are diverted from their main objective by maliciously embedded irrelevant tasks in the prompt. This vulnerability affects even the most advanced models, reducing task accuracy significantly. Certain alignment techniques can worsen this issue, leading to covert compliance where models follow hidden adversarial instructions without revealing them in the output. To address this threat, a training-based defense combining Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning on synthetic adversarial data has been proposed, improving robustness against distractor attacks. These findings highlight the urgent need to address reasoning distraction to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of large reasoning models. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled remarkable performance on complex tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. In this paper, we identify and systematically analyze a critical vulnerability we term reasoning distraction, where LRMs are diverted from their primary objective by irrelevant yet complex tasks maliciously embedded in the prompt. Through a comprehensive study across diverse models and benchmarks, we show that even state-of-the-art LRMs are highly susceptible, with injected distractors reducing task accuracy by up to 60%. We further reveal that certain alignment techniques can amplify this weakness and that models may exhibit covert compliance, following hidden adversarial instructions in reasoning while concealing them in the final output. To mitigate these risks, we propose a training-based defense that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic adversarial data, improving robustness by over 50 points on challenging distractor attacks. Our findings establish reasoning distraction as a distinct and urgent threat to LRM reliability and provide a practical step toward safer and more trustworthy reasoning systems.

Summary: 
The study focuses on identifying efficiency bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. It decomposes end-to-end latency into LLM API latency and web environment latency. A comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers shows high variability in API-based agentic systems. Web environment latency can contribute significantly to overall latency in web-based agentic systems. SpecCache, a caching framework with speculative execution, is proposed to reduce web environment overhead. Evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SpecCache improves cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to random caching strategies and reduces web environment overhead by up to 3.2x without impacting agentic system performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. To further enhance LLM capabilities, recent agentic systems, such as Deep Research, incorporate web interactions into LLM reasoning to mitigate uncertainties and reduce potential errors. However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning performance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency into two primary components: LLM API latency and web environment latency. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to demonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web environment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a web-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching framework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment overhead. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks show that our approach improves the cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to a random caching strategy, while reducing web environment overhead by up to 3.2x, without degrading agentic system performance.

Summary: 
The article discusses the importance of multi-hop reasoning in question answering for large language models. It categorizes multi-hop reasoning into parallel fact-verification and chained reasoning. Current approaches either focus on fact verification or knowledge graph path construction, leading to limitations in efficiency and accuracy. To address these challenges, the authors propose a dual-track knowledge graph verification and reasoning framework (DTKG), inspired by Dual Process Theory in cognitive science. DTKG consists of two stages: the Classification Stage and the Branch Processing Stage. This framework aims to improve efficiency and accuracy in multi-hop question answering tasks by combining the strengths of both fact verification and path-based reasoning techniques. <div>
arXiv:2510.16302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-hop reasoning for question answering (QA) plays a critical role in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for modern large language models (LLMs). The accurate answer can be obtained through retrieving relational structure of entities from knowledge graph (KG). Regarding the inherent relation-dependency and reasoning pattern, multi-hop reasoning can be in general classified into two categories: i) parallel fact-verification multi-hop reasoning question, i.e., requiring simultaneous verifications of multiple independent sub-questions; and ii) chained multi-hop reasoning questions, i.e., demanding sequential multi-step inference with intermediate conclusions serving as essential premises for subsequent reasoning. Currently, the multi-hop reasoning approaches singly employ one of two techniques: LLM response-based fact verification and KG path-based chain construction. Nevertheless, the former excels at parallel fact-verification but underperforms on chained reasoning tasks, while the latter demonstrates proficiency in chained multi-hop reasoning but suffers from redundant path retrieval when handling parallel fact-verification reasoning. These limitations deteriorate the efficiency and accuracy for multi-hop QA tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel dual-track KG verification and reasoning framework DTKG, which is inspired by the Dual Process Theory in cognitive science. Specifically, DTKG comprises two main stages: the Classification Stage and the Branch Processing Stage.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent reasoning steps while violating simple mathematical or logical constraints. We introduce MedRule-KG, a compact typed knowledge graph coupled with a symbolic verifier, designed to enforce mathematically interpretable rules in reasoning tasks. MedRule-KG encodes entities, relations, and three domain-inspired rules, while the verifier checks predictions and applies minimal corrections to guarantee consistency. On a 90-example FDA-derived benchmark, grounding in MedRule-KG improves exact match (EM) from 0.767 to 0.900, and adding the verifier yields 1.000 EM while eliminating rule violations entirely. We demonstrate how MedRule-KG provides a general scaffold for safe mathematical reasoning, discuss ablations, and release code and data to encourage reproducibility.

Abstract: Existing concept erasure methods for text-to-image diffusion models commonly rely on fixed anchor strategies, which often lead to critical issues such as concept re-emergence and erosion. To address this, we conduct causal tracing to reveal the inherent sensitivity of erasure to anchor selection and define Sibling Exclusive Concepts as a superior class of anchors. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{SELECT} (Sibling-Exclusive Evaluation for Contextual Targeting), a dynamic anchor selection framework designed to overcome the limitations of fixed anchors. Our framework introduces a novel two-stage evaluation mechanism that automatically discovers optimal anchors for precise erasure while identifying critical boundary anchors to preserve related concepts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SELECT, as a universal anchor solution, not only efficiently adapts to multiple erasure frameworks but also consistently outperforms existing baselines across key performance metrics, averaging only 4 seconds for anchor mining of a single concept.

Summary:  
- Users often exhibit inconsistent preferences when interacting with algorithms, signaling undesired content as desirable.
- The study models user decision-making as split between a rational system and an impulsive system, leading to a multi-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game.
- The burden of alignment is defined as the minimum horizon users must optimize to steer the algorithm effectively towards their interests.
- A critical horizon exists where foresighted users can achieve alignment, while others align with the algorithm’s objective.
- Even a small, costly signal such as an extra click can significantly reduce the burden and help users align the algorithm with their interests. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.16368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From media platforms to chatbots, algorithms shape how people interact, learn, and discover information. Such interactions between users and an algorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can guide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively engaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent preferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little long-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable. Focusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for such users to align the algorithm with their true interests?
  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split between a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive system 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a multi-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users, specifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the algorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of alignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively steer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are sufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are instead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be long, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal (e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework explains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven algorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both the challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment.

Summary:  
Current approaches to enhancing LLM reasoning fall into two paradigms: Monitor-Generate methods excel at strategic planning but lack verification mechanisms, and Generate-Verify approaches iteratively refine outputs without task assessment. To bridge this gap, the authors implemented Flavell's cognitive monitoring model within a three-phase iterative system. Initial results on GSM8K show an accuracy of 75.42%, outperforming SELF-REFINE and Self-Verification, while requiring fewer attempts and a slightly higher inference cost. The study suggests that upfront monitoring leads to higher-quality initial solutions, reducing the need for further refinement. Further evaluation beyond arithmetic reasoning is essential to establish the generalizability of these findings.

Abstract: Current approaches to enhancing LLM reasoning follows two isolated paradigms: Monitor-Generate methods like Plan-and-Solve (Wang et al., 2023) and SELF-DISCOVER (Zhou et al., 2024) excel at strategic planning but lack mechanisms to verify whether selected strategies succeed; while Generate-Verify approaches like Self-Verification (Weng et al., 2022) and SELF-REFINE (Madaan et al., 2023) iteratively refine outputs but commence generation blindly without task assessment. This separation creates inefficiencies -- strategies fail without feedback, and refinement occurs without strategic grounding. We address this gap by implementing Flavell's cognitive monitoring model (1979) from the broader Monitor-Generate-Verify framework (Oh and Gobet, 2025), operationalising it as a three-phase iterative system. On GSM8K, preliminary results show 75.42% accuracy versus 68.44% for SELF-REFINE and 67.07% for Self-Verification, while requiring fewer attempts (1.3 vs 2.0) at 27-37% increased inference cost. These initial findings suggest upfront monitoring produces higher-quality initial solutions that reduce refinement needs, though evaluation beyond arithmetic reasoning is needed to establish generalisability.

<div> Keywords: Humanoid-inspired Structural Causal Model, domain generalization, causal relationships, model robustness, interpretability

Summary: 
The Humanoid-inspired Structural Causal Model (HSCM) introduces a new causal framework for domain generalization, inspired by human intelligence. HSCM focuses on replicating the hierarchical processing and multi-level learning of human vision systems to enhance generalization across diverse domains. By disentangling and reweighting key image attributes such as color, texture, and shape, HSCM improves model robustness and interpretability. The approach leverages the flexibility and adaptability of human intelligence to enable more effective transfer and learning in dynamic environments. Theoretical and empirical evaluations show that HSCM outperforms existing domain generalization models, providing a principled method for capturing causal relationships. The code for HSCM is available on Github for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: This paper proposes the Humanoid-inspired Structural Causal Model (HSCM), a novel causal framework inspired by human intelligence, designed to overcome the limitations of conventional domain generalization models. Unlike approaches that rely on statistics to capture data-label dependencies and learn distortion-invariant representations, HSCM replicates the hierarchical processing and multi-level learning of human vision systems, focusing on modeling fine-grained causal mechanisms. By disentangling and reweighting key image attributes such as color, texture, and shape, HSCM enhances generalization across diverse domains, ensuring robust performance and interpretability. Leveraging the flexibility and adaptability of human intelligence, our approach enables more effective transfer and learning in dynamic, complex environments. Through both theoretical and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that HSCM outperforms existing domain generalization models, providing a more principled method for capturing causal relationships and improving model robustness. The code is available at https://github.com/lambett/HSCM.

<div> Keywords: personalized interactions, language model, user modeling, memory framework, user profile

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges in achieving personalized and continuous interactions in large language model-based conversational systems. Existing solutions like retrieval-augmented generation and explicit memory systems focus on fact-level storage and retrieval but lack the ability to distill latent preferences and deep traits from multi-turn dialogues. This limitation hinders long-term user modeling and leads to shallow personalized interactions. To address this, the authors propose a self-evolving memory framework called RGMem inspired by the renormalization group theory in physics. This framework organizes dialogue history into multiple scales, extracting semantics and user insights from episodic fragments and progressively forming a dynamically-evolved user profile through hierarchical operations. By modeling memory evolution as a multi-scale process of information compression and emergence, RGMem achieves high-level and accurate user profiles from microscopic-level interactions. <div>

Abstract: Personalized and continuous interactions are the key to enhancing user experience in today's large language model (LLM)-based conversational systems, however, the finite context windows and static parametric memory make it difficult to model the cross-session long-term user states and behavioral consistency. Currently, the existing solutions to this predicament, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and explicit memory systems, primarily focus on fact-level storage and retrieval, lacking the capability to distill latent preferences and deep traits from the multi-turn dialogues, which limits the long-term and effective user modeling, directly leading to the personalized interactions remaining shallow, and hindering the cross-session continuity. To realize the long-term memory and behavioral consistency for Language Agents in LLM era, we propose a self-evolving memory framework RGMem, inspired by the ideology of classic renormalization group (RG) in physics, this framework enables to organize the dialogue history in multiple scales: it first extracts semantics and user insights from episodic fragments, then through hierarchical coarse-graining and rescaling operations, progressively forms a dynamically-evolved user profile. The core innovation of our work lies in modeling memory evolution as a multi-scale process of information compression and emergence, which accomplishes the high-level and accurate user profiles from noisy and microscopic-level interactions.

Abstract: As customer feedback becomes increasingly central to strategic growth, the ability to derive actionable insights from unstructured reviews is essential. While traditional AI-driven systems excel at predicting user preferences, far less work has focused on transforming customer reviews into prescriptive, business-facing recommendations. This paper introduces ReviewSense, a novel prescriptive decision support framework that leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to transform customer reviews into targeted, actionable business recommendations. By identifying key trends, recurring issues, and specific concerns within customer sentiments, ReviewSense extends beyond preference-based systems to provide businesses with deeper insights for sustaining growth and enhancing customer loyalty. The novelty of this work lies in integrating clustering, LLM adaptation, and expert-driven evaluation into a unified, business-facing pipeline. Preliminary manual evaluations indicate strong alignment between the model's recommendations and business objectives, highlighting its potential for driving data-informed decision-making. This framework offers a new perspective on AI-driven sentiment analysis, demonstrating its value in refining business strategies and maximizing the impact of customer feedback.

arXiv:2510.16476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, with models like OpenAI's O-series and DeepSeek R1 excelling at tasks such as mathematics, coding, logic, and puzzles through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). However, their ability to solve more complex optimization problems - particularly NP-hard tasks - remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose NP-ENGINE, the first comprehensive framework for training and evaluating LLMs on NP-hard problems. NP-ENGINE covers 10 tasks across five domains, each equipped with (i) a controllable instance generator, (ii) a rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver that provides approximate optimal solutions as ground truth. This generator-verifier-heuristic pipeline enables scalable and verifiable RLVR training under hierarchical difficulties. We also introduce NP-BENCH, a benchmark derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to tackle NP-hard level reasoning problems, focusing not only on feasibility but also on solution quality. Additionally, we present QWEN2.5-7B-NP, a model trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum learning on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, which significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and achieves SOTA performance with the same model size. Beyond in-domain tasks, we demonstrate that RLVR training on NP-ENGINE-DATA enables strong out-of-domain (OOD) generalization to reasoning tasks (logic, puzzles, math, and knowledge), as well as non-reasoning tasks such as instruction following. We also observe a scaling trend: increasing task diversity improves OOD generalization. These findings suggest that task-rich RLVR training is a promising direction for advancing LLM's reasoning ability, revealing new insights into the scaling laws of RLVR.

<div> Keywords: typed computer language, polynomial time halting, vector-symbolic architecture (VSA), holographic declarative memory (HDM), program synthesis

Summary: 
The article introduces Doug, a typed computer language that ensures all programs can be proven to halt in polynomial time. Doug is based on the light linear functional programming language (LLFPL) and utilizes a vector-symbolic architecture (VSA) for encoding. Types in Doug are represented using a slot-value encoding scheme inspired by holographic declarative memory (HDM). The language also incorporates a Lisp VSA variant for encoding terms. Doug allows types to be interpreted as points in a neural network's embedding space, enabling learnability through similarity in structure and content. The article suggests that skill acquisition can be viewed as program synthesis, with Doug aiming to enhance the pace of learning skilled behaviors. The approach is positioned as a step towards modeling human mental representations and the acquisition of these representations in the brain. <div>
arXiv:2510.16533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a typed computer language, Doug, in which all typed programs may be proved to halt in polynomial time, encoded in a vector-symbolic architecture (VSA). Doug is just an encoding of the light linear functional programming language (LLFPL) described by (Schimanski2009, ch. 7). The types of Doug are encoded using a slot-value encoding scheme based on holographic declarative memory (HDM; Kelly, 2020). The terms of Doug are encoded using a variant of the Lisp VSA defined by (Flanagan, 2024). Doug allows for some points on the embedding space of a neural network to be interpreted as types, where the types of nearby points are similar both in structure and content. Types in Doug are therefore learnable by a neural network. Following (Chollet, 2019), (Card, 1983), and (Newell, 1981), we view skill as the application of a procedure, or program of action, that causes a goal to be satisfied. Skill acquisition may therefore be expressed as program synthesis. Using Doug, we hope to describe a form of learning of skilled behaviour that follows a human-like pace of skill acquisition (i.e., substantially faster than brute force; Heathcote, 2000), exceeding the efficiency of all currently existing approaches (Kaplan, 2020; Jones, 2021; Chollet, 2024). Our approach brings us one step closer to modeling human mental representations, as they must actually exist in the brain, and those representations' acquisition, as they are actually learned.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Urban-R1, a reinforcement learning-based framework for improving Urban General Intelligence (UGI) models. Current models often exhibit geospatial bias, leading to region-specific predictions and limited generalization. Urban-R1 addresses this issue by using Group Relative Policy Optimization to optimize reasoning across different geographic groups. It also leverages urban region profiling as a proxy task to provide measurable rewards from diverse urban data sources. Experimental results demonstrate that Urban-R1 effectively mitigates geo-bias and enhances cross-region generalization, surpassing models trained using supervised fine-tuning. The study emphasizes reinforcement learning alignment as a promising approach to achieve equitable and trustworthy urban intelligence. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Rapid urbanization intensifies the demand for Urban General Intelligence (UGI), referring to AI systems that can understand and reason about complex urban environments. Recent studies have built urban foundation models using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs and MLLMs, yet these models exhibit persistent geospatial bias, producing regionally skewed predictions and limited generalization. To this end, we propose Urban-R1, a reinforcement learning-based post-training framework that aligns MLLMs with the objectives of UGI. Urban-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize reasoning across geographic groups and employs urban region profiling as a proxy task to provide measurable rewards from multimodal urban data. Extensive experiments across diverse regions and tasks show that Urban-R1 effectively mitigates geo-bias and improves cross-region generalization, outperforming both SFT-trained and closed-source models. Our results highlight reinforcement learning alignment as a promising pathway toward equitable and trustworthy urban intelligence.

Abstract: Engineering construction automation aims to transform natural language specifications into physically viable structures, requiring complex integrated reasoning under strict physical constraints. While modern LLMs possess broad knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM agentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities. On eight frontier LLMs, BuildArena comprehensively evaluates their capabilities for language-driven and physics-grounded construction automation.

<div> coordination protocol, Ripple Effect Protocol (REP), agent-centric communication, collective behavior, environmental variables

Summary:<br /><br />The article introduces the Ripple Effect Protocol (REP) as a coordination protocol that allows AI agents to share their decisions along with lightweight sensitivities, enabling faster and more stable alignment in group behavior. REP improves coordination accuracy and efficiency by 41 to 100% compared to existing protocols like A2A, particularly in scenarios with growing agent populations. By focusing on coordination at the protocol level, REP provides a scalable infrastructure for communication and alignment among a network of agents. The protocol formalization separates message schemas from aggregation rules, allowing for flexibility in handling sensitivities from Local Learning Modules (LLMs). Benchmarks across different domains such as supply chain cascades, preference aggregation, and resource allocation demonstrate REP's effectiveness in improving group outcomes and adaptability to varying incentives and network topologies. By emphasizing coordination over communication, REP addresses the limitations of current mechanisms in achieving better collective behavior among AI agents. <div>

Abstract: Modern AI agents can exchange messages using protocols such as A2A and ACP, yet these mechanisms emphasize communication over coordination. As agent populations grow, this limitation produces brittle collective behavior, where individually smart agents converge on poor group outcomes. We introduce the Ripple Effect Protocol (REP), a coordination protocol in which agents share not only their decisions but also lightweight sensitivities - signals expressing how their choices would change if key environmental variables shifted. These sensitivities ripple through local networks, enabling groups to align faster and more stably than with agent-centric communication alone. We formalize REP's protocol specification, separating required message schemas from optional aggregation rules, and evaluate it across scenarios with varying incentives and network topologies. Benchmarks across three domains: (i) supply chain cascades (Beer Game), (ii) preference aggregation in sparse networks (Movie Scheduling), and (iii) sustainable resource allocation (Fishbanks) show that REP improves coordination accuracy and efficiency over A2A by 41 to 100%, while flexibly handling multimodal sensitivity signals from LLMs. By making coordination a protocol-level capability, REP provides scalable infrastructure for the emerging Internet of Agents

Summary: 
GraphFlow is a framework designed to enhance the retrieval process of Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by efficiently retrieving accurate and diverse knowledge required for real-world queries from text-rich KGs. It employs a transition-based flow matching objective to optimize a retrieval policy and flow estimator, factorizing the reward of the retrieval outcome to guide the policy in retrieving candidates proportionally to their reward. This approach allows GraphFlow to explore high-quality regions of KGs and yield diverse and relevant results. Evaluation on the STaRK benchmark, which includes real-world queries over text-rich KGs, shows that GraphFlow outperforms strong KG-RAG baselines by 10% on average in hit rate and recall. Moreover, it demonstrates strong generalization to unseen KGs, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on knowledge graphs (KGs) enhances large language models (LLMs) by providing structured and interpretable external knowledge. However, existing KG-based RAG methods struggle to retrieve accurate and diverse information from text-rich KGs for complex real-world queries. Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a way to align the retrieval process of KG-based RAG with query-specific knowledge requirements, but they heavily rely on process-level supervision signals that are expensive and hard to obtain on KGs. To address this challenge, we propose GraphFlow, a framework that efficiently retrieves accurate and diverse knowledge required for real-world queries from text-rich KGs. GraphFlow employs a transition-based flow matching objective to jointly optimize a retrieval policy and a flow estimator. The flow estimator factorizes the reward of the retrieval outcome into the intermediate retrieval states. Such reward factorization guides the retrieval policy to retrieve candidates from KGs in proportion to their reward. This allows GraphFlow to explore high-quality regions of KGs that yield diverse and relevant results. We evaluate GraphFlow on the STaRK benchmark, which includes real-world queries from multiple domains over text-rich KGs. GraphFlow outperforms strong KG-RAG baselines, including GPT-4o, by 10% on average in hit rate and recall. It also shows strong generalization to unseen KGs, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new semi-supervised method, ssCDL, for uncertain knowledge graph (UKG) completion. It addresses the issue of imbalanced distributions of triple confidences by transforming each confidence into a confidence distribution. ssCDL learns UKG embeddings by iteratively incorporating relational learning on labeled and unlabeled data with pseudo labels. The pseudo labels are generated using meta-learning techniques to rebalance the distribution of triple confidences. Experimental results on two UKG datasets show that ssCDL outperforms existing baselines in various evaluation metrics. <div>

Abstract: Uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs) associate each triple with a confidence score to provide more precise knowledge representations. Recently, since real-world UKGs suffer from the incompleteness, uncertain knowledge graph (UKG) completion attracts more attention, aiming to complete missing triples and confidences. Current studies attempt to learn UKG embeddings to solve this problem, but they neglect the extremely imbalanced distributions of triple confidences. This causes that the learnt embeddings are insufficient to high-quality UKG completion. Thus, in this paper, to address the above issue, we propose a new semi-supervised Confidence Distribution Learning (ssCDL) method for UKG completion, where each triple confidence is transformed into a confidence distribution to introduce more supervision information of different confidences to reinforce the embedding learning process. ssCDL iteratively learns UKG embedding by relational learning on labeled data (i.e., existing triples with confidences) and unlabeled data with pseudo labels (i.e., unseen triples with the generated confidences), which are predicted by meta-learning to augment the training data and rebalance the distribution of triple confidences. Experiments on two UKG datasets demonstrate that ssCDL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation metrics.

The paper introduces MERCI, a novel RL algorithm aimed at improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). MERCI leverages count-based exploration to incentivize LLMs to explore new reasoning trajectories while preserving the learning signal from task rewards. By integrating MERCI into advanced RL frameworks like GRPO, experiments showcase that the algorithm encourages richer and more varied chains of thought, leading to significant performance improvements over strong baselines. This targeted intrinsic motivation enables LLMs to escape local routines and discover better solutions, making exploration more reliable for language model reasoning. <div>
arXiv:2510.16614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a compelling way to strengthen the multi step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL paradigms still lean on sparse outcome-based rewards and limited exploration, which often drives LLMs toward repetitive and suboptimal reasoning patterns. In this paper, we study the central question of how to design exploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that augments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on the idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin Flipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic uncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic reward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task rewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions. It indicates that our targeted intrinsic motivation can make exploration reliable for language model reasoning.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models has a transformative effect on neuroscience research, which represents a paradigm shift from the traditional computational methods through the facilitation of end-to-end learning from raw brain signals and neural data. In this paper, we explore the transformative effects of large-scale AI models on five major neuroscience domains: neuroimaging and data processing, brain-computer interfaces and neural decoding, molecular neuroscience and genomic modeling, clinical assistance and translational frameworks, and disease-specific applications across neurological and psychiatric disorders. These models are demonstrated to address major computational neuroscience challenges, including multimodal neural data integration, spatiotemporal pattern interpretation, and the derivation of translational frameworks for clinical deployment. Moreover, the interaction between neuroscience and AI has become increasingly reciprocal, as biologically informed architectural constraints are now incorporated to develop more interpretable and computationally efficient models. This review highlights both the notable promise of such technologies and key implementation considerations, with particular emphasis on rigorous evaluation frameworks, effective domain knowledge integration, and comprehensive ethical guidelines for clinical use. Finally, a systematic listing of critical neuroscience datasets used to derive and validate large-scale AI models across diverse research applications is provided.

Summary:
Complex vehicle routing problems pose a significant challenge, necessitating expert effort for interpretation and algorithm design. Current approaches using large language models still require external intervention, limiting autonomy and leading to errors. To address this, the authors propose the Agentic Framework with LLMs (AFL), enabling full automation from problem to solution. AFL extracts knowledge from raw inputs, generating code without external solvers. It divides the process into manageable subtasks and utilizes specialized agents for consistency and logical soundness. Experimental results on 60 VRPs, including practical variants, demonstrate AFL's effectiveness, achieving high rates of solution feasibility and code reliability. The framework outperforms existing LLM-based methods, showcasing promising performance on standard benchmarks. As a comprehensive solution, AFL shows potential for automating complex VRPs with high accuracy and reliability.

AFL directly extracts knowledge from raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted modules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the overall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized agents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and logical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from standard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and generality of our framework, showing comparable performance against meticulously designed algorithms. Notably, it substantially outperforms existing LLM-based baselines in both code reliability and solution feasibility, achieving rates close to 100% on the evaluated benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: agentic AI, Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning, Planning, Tool use, Memory 

Summary: 
The survey discusses the paradigm shift in agentic AI, where Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve to not just respond but to act, reason, and adapt. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is identified as the key algorithm enabling this shift from Pipeline-based systems to the Model-native paradigm. The combination of LLM + RL + Task allows for a unified solution across various domains. The evolution of capabilities such as Planning, Tool use, and Memory from externally scripted modules to learned behaviors within models is examined. Two major agent applications, Deep Research and GUI agents, are highlighted, emphasizing long-horizon reasoning and embodied interaction, respectively. The survey also touches on the internalization of capabilities like Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, as well as the evolving roles of the system and model layers in future agentic AI development. The trajectory outlined points towards model-native agentic AI as a framework for integrated learning and interaction, marking a shift towards developing models that grow intelligence through experience.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of agentic AI marks a new phase in artificial intelligence, where Large Language Models (LLMs) no longer merely respond but act, reason, and adapt. This survey traces the paradigm shift in building agentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory are orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm, where these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We first position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling this paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to outcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task across language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey systematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory -- has evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors. Furthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent applications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon reasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by discussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the system and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments outline a coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated learning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing systems that apply intelligence to developing models that grow intelligence through experience.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed information access and reasoning through open-ended natural language interaction. However, LLMs remain limited by static knowledge, factual hallucinations, and the inability to retrieve real-time or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model outputs in external evidence, but traditional RAG pipelines are often single turn and heuristic, lacking adaptive control over retrieval and reasoning. Recent advances in agentic search address these limitations by enabling LLMs to plan, retrieve, and reflect through multi-step interaction with search environments. Within this paradigm, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful mechanism for adaptive and self-improving search behavior. This survey provides the first comprehensive overview of \emph{RL-based agentic search}, organizing the emerging field along three complementary dimensions: (i) What RL is for (functional roles), (ii) How RL is used (optimization strategies), and (iii) Where RL is applied (scope of optimization). We summarize representative methods, evaluation protocols, and applications, and discuss open challenges and future directions toward building reliable and scalable RL driven agentic search systems. We hope this survey will inspire future research on the integration of RL and agentic search. Our repository is available at https://github.com/ventr1c/Awesome-RL-based-Agentic-Search-Papers.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a workflow that combines physics-based and empirical models with optimization and analytics to address the challenges of high computational cost and limited transparency in simulation-driven engineering workflows. The proposed workflow involves training lightweight emulators on compact designs of experiments to provide fast approximations of expensive simulators and enable rigorous uncertainty quantification. This approach also includes global and local Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analyses for better transparency and reliability in decision-making. A methodology is proposed for using surrogate-based explainability tools, supporting continuous and categorical inputs and combining global-effect and uncertainty analyses with local attribution. The methodology evaluates the consistency of explanations across surrogate models, diagnosing surrogate adequacy and guiding further data collection or model refinement. Case studies on a hybrid-electric aircraft design and an agent-based model of urban segregation demonstrate the efficiency of the surrogate model and XAI coupling in uncovering nonlinear interactions, identifying key design and policy levers, and guiding further data collection or model refinement.<br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Complex systems are increasingly explored through simulation-driven engineering workflows that combine physics-based and empirical models with optimization and analytics. Despite their power, these workflows face two central obstacles: (1) high computational cost, since accurate exploration requires many expensive simulator runs; and (2) limited transparency and reliability when decisions rely on opaque blackbox components. We propose a workflow that addresses both challenges by training lightweight emulators on compact designs of experiments that (i) provide fast, low-latency approximations of expensive simulators, (ii) enable rigorous uncertainty quantification, and (iii) are adapted for global and local Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analyses. This workflow unifies every simulation-based complex-system analysis tool, ranging from engineering design to agent-based models for socio-environmental understanding. In this paper, we proposea comparative methodology and practical recommendations for using surrogate-based explainability tools within the proposed workflow. The methodology supports continuous and categorical inputs, combines global-effect and uncertainty analyses with local attribution, and evaluates the consistency of explanations across surrogate models, thereby diagnosing surrogate adequacy and guiding further data collection or model refinement. We demonstrate the approach on two contrasting case studies: a multidisciplinary design analysis of a hybrid-electric aircraft and an agent-based model of urban segregation. Results show that the surrogate model and XAI coupling enables large-scale exploration in seconds, uncovers nonlinear interactions and emergent behaviors, identifies key design and policy levers, and signals regions where surrogates require more data or alternative architectures.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by incorporating visual and textual modalities, enabling richer and more expressive entity representations. However, existing MKGs often suffer from incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks. Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on benchmark FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art performance while substantially improving computational efficiency, establishing a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge graph completion.

<div> Keywords: multimodal, full-duplex, end-to-end model, SA-MoE architecture, human-like behaviors

Summary: <br /><br />Human interaction involves multiple modes of communication, such as listening, watching, speaking, and acting, all happening simultaneously. ELLSA is introduced as the first full-duplex, end-to-end model capable of perceiving and generating across vision, text, speech, and action within a single architecture. The model utilizes a unique SA-MoE architecture that routes each modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention backbone. ELLSA demonstrates the ability to exhibit advanced interactive behaviors like dialogue and action turn-taking, defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, and context-grounded visual question answering, surpassing modality-specific baselines on various benchmarks. This innovative approach contributes to the development of more natural and general interactive intelligence, moving closer to the goal of artificial general intelligence.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.16756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human interaction is inherently multimodal and full-duplex: we listen while watching, speak while acting, and fluidly adapt to turn-taking and interruptions. Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models simulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act), which, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that simultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action within a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of reach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel SA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention backbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal perception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components while enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality interference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA matches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking, defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual question answering, and action barge-ins. We contend that ELLSA represents a step toward more natural and general interactive intelligence, contributing to the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence. All data, code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

<br />
GraphVista is a new framework that improves scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding tasks. It addresses the limitations of vision-language models by organizing graph information hierarchically into a lightweight GraphRAG base and introducing a planning agent to route tasks to the most suitable modality. This allows GraphVista to handle larger graphs, up to 200 times larger than current benchmarks, and outperform existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods. By leveraging the complementary strengths of both text and visual modalities, GraphVista achieves up to 4.4 times quality improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. The framework optimizes task-relevant textual descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs while compressing redundant context, ensuring key reasoning elements are preserved. Overall, GraphVista demonstrates superior performance in graph understanding tasks through effective modality coordination and scalability enhancements.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in graph understanding, but remain limited by input-token constraints, facing scalability bottlenecks and lacking effective mechanisms to coordinate textual and visual modalities. To address these challenges, we propose GraphVista, a unified framework that enhances both scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding. For scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination, GraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable modality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual modality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large graphs, up to $200\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods, achieving up to $4.4\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.

Summary:
The article introduces a new knowledge modeling framework called the Domain-Contextualized Concept Graph (CDC) that elevates domains to primary components of conceptual representation. CDC utilizes a C-D-C triple structure, where domain specifications act as dynamic classification dimensions. Grounded in a cognitive-linguistic mapping principle, CDC enables understanding concepts through contextual frames. The framework formalizes over twenty standardized relation predicates and is implemented in Prolog for complete inference capabilities. Case studies in education, enterprise knowledge systems, and technical documentation illustrate that CDC facilitates context-aware reasoning, cross-domain analogy, and personalized knowledge modeling, which are not achievable through traditional ontology-based approaches. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graphs are constrained by fixed ontologies that organize concepts within rigid hierarchical structures. The root cause lies in treating domains as implicit context rather than as explicit, reasoning-level components. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Domain-Contextualized Concept Graph (CDC), a novel knowledge modeling framework that elevates domains to first-class elements of conceptual representation. CDC adopts a C-D-C triple structure -  - where domain specifications serve as dynamic classification dimensions defined on demand. Grounded in a cognitive-linguistic isomorphic mapping principle, CDC operationalizes how humans understand concepts through contextual frames. We formalize more than twenty standardized relation predicates (structural, logical, cross-domain, and temporal) and implement CDC in Prolog for full inference capability. Case studies in education, enterprise knowledge systems, and technical documentation demonstrate that CDC enables context-aware reasoning, cross-domain analogy, and personalized knowledge modeling - capabilities unattainable under traditional ontology-based frameworks.

Summary:
Autonomous data science has long been a challenge, but with the introduction of powerful large language models (LLMs), it is now becoming feasible. DeepAnalyze-8B is the first agentic LLM designed specifically for autonomous data science, capable of completing the entire data analysis pipeline from data sources to deep research reports. Through a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm, DeepAnalyze learns to perform various data tasks, ranging from data question answering to open-ended data research. The model also utilizes a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework to generate high-quality training data. While previous workflow-based agents have limitations due to predefined workflows, DeepAnalyze outperforms them with just 8B parameters. The model, code, and training data for DeepAnalyze are open-sourced, making strides towards the realization of fully autonomous data science.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Autonomous data science, from raw data sources to analyst-grade deep research reports, has been a long-standing challenge, and is now becoming feasible with the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs). Recent workflow-based data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B, the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training, DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced, paving the way toward autonomous data science.

Summary:<br />
The paper discusses the challenges faced in training Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents compared to Language Model (LLM) agents due to the shift from textual states to visual observations. To address this, the authors enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process using reinforcement learning, treating it as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). They highlight the importance of decomposing the agent's reasoning into State Estimation and Transition Modeling for success. The study reveals that the representation of internal beliefs is task-dependent, with Natural Language excelling in capturing semantic relationships, while Structured formats are better for manipulation and control tasks. A new World Modeling Reward and Bi-Level General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) are introduced to improve turn-level credit assignment. Through this visual state reasoning approach, a 3-billion-parameter model achieves significant performance improvements across various benchmarks, outperforming existing reasoning models. The experiments are conducted within the VAGEN framework, a scalable system for training multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: A key challenge in training Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents, compared to Language Model (LLM) agents, lies in the shift from textual states to complex visual observations. This transition introduces partial observability and demands robust world modeling. We ask: Can VLM agents construct internal world models through explicit visual state reasoning? To address this question, we architecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via reinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into State Estimation ("what is the current state?") and Transition Modeling ("what comes next?") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning strategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs reveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language excels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured formats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on these insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense, turn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment. Through this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a score of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\times$ improvement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary reasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5 (0.62). All experiments are conducted within our VAGEN framework, a scalable system for training and analyzing multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual environments.

Further, we find that users' self-reported ease of identification and understanding for every explanation did not correlate with their accuracy.

Summary:
GPU kernel optimization is crucial for modern AI but remains a challenging task due to complex interactions between hardware and software. Existing approaches to automated code generation struggle to navigate this complexity effectively. This study introduces an innovative LLM agentic framework for GPU kernel optimization that mimics expert engineer workflows. By leveraging multi-agent collaboration, grounded instruction, dynamic context management, and strategic search, the framework enables LLMs to reason about hardware trade-offs, incorporate profiling feedback, and refine kernels iteratively. Testing on KernelBench, a benchmark for LLM-based kernel optimization, showed significant improvements over baseline agents. The system consistently produced correct solutions where baselines failed and achieved up to 16x faster runtime performance in optimized kernels. These results showcase the potential of agentic LLM frameworks to drive fully automated and scalable GPU kernel optimization efforts.

Abstract: The efficiency of GPU kernels is central to the progress of modern AI, yet optimizing them remains a difficult and labor-intensive task due to complex interactions between memory hierarchies, thread scheduling, and hardware-specific characteristics. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities for automated code generation, existing approaches largely treat LLMs as single-shot generators or naive refinement tools, limiting their effectiveness in navigating the irregular kernel optimization landscape. We introduce an LLM agentic framework for GPU kernel optimization that systematically explores the design space through multi-agent collaboration, grounded instruction, dynamic context management, and strategic search. This framework mimics the workflow of expert engineers, enabling LLMs to reason about hardware trade-offs, incorporate profiling feedback, and refine kernels iteratively. We evaluate our approach on KernelBench, a benchmark for LLM-based kernel optimization, and demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline agents: our system produces correct solutions where baselines often fail, and achieves kernels with up to 16x faster runtime performance. These results highlight the potential of agentic LLM frameworks to advance fully automated, scalable GPU kernel optimization.

Summary: 
<br />
ToolCritic is a diagnostic framework designed to enhance the behavior of large language models (LLMs) in multi-turn, tool-augmented dialogues by detecting and addressing specific errors related to tool-calling. The framework identifies eight distinct error types such as premature invocation and argument misalignment, providing targeted feedback to the main LLM for response revision. Through the use of strong reasoning, task understanding, and orchestration capabilities, the main LLM can improve its tool-calling accuracy based on ToolCritic's feedback. By utilizing a synthetic dataset for training, ToolCritic demonstrates a significant improvement in tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% compared to baseline methods. This advancement signifies a promising step towards enhancing the integration of LLMs with external tools in real-world dialogue applications.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in real-world applications, but tool usage errors still hinder their reliability. We introduce ToolCritic, a diagnostic framework that evaluates and improves LLM behavior in multi-turn, tool-augmented dialogues. ToolCritic detects eight distinct error types specific to tool-calling (e.g., premature invocation, argument misalignment, and misinterpretation of tool outputs) and provides targeted feedback to the main LLM. The main LLM, assumed to have strong reasoning, task understanding and orchestration capabilities, then revises its response based on ToolCritic's feedback. We systematically define these error categories and construct a synthetic dataset to train ToolCritic. Experimental results on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset demonstrate that ToolCritic improves tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% over baselines, including zero-shot prompting and self-correction techniques. This represents a promising step toward more robust LLM integration with external tools in real-world dialogue applications.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our ability to identify diverse cell types and their transcriptomic signatures. However, annotating these signatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a major challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but struggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured ontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID: https://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL-AID), a novel multi-agent AI system that integrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate and robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using relevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing interpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77% of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles. BRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with neurologically meaningful descriptions. Hence, we create a valuable resource to support community-driven cell type annotation.

<title>Structured Debate Improves Corporate Credit Reasoning in Financial AI</title>

Abstract: Despite advances in financial AI, the automation of evidence-based reasoning remains unresolved in corporate credit assessment, where qualitative non-financial indicators exert decisive influence on loan repayment outcomes yet resist formalization. Existing approaches focus predominantly on numerical prediction and provide limited support for the interpretive judgments required in professional loan evaluation. This study develops and evaluates two operational large language model (LLM)-based systems designed to generate structured reasoning from non-financial evidence. The first is a non-adversarial single-agent system (NAS) that produces bidirectional analysis through a single-pass reasoning pipeline. The second is a debate-based multi-agent system (KPD-MADS) that operationalizes adversarial verification through a ten-step structured interaction protocol grounded in Karl Popper's critical dialogue framework. Both systems were applied to three real corporate cases and evaluated by experienced credit risk professionals. Compared to manual expert reporting, both systems achieved substantial productivity gains (NAS: 11.55 s per case; KPD-MADS: 91.97 s; human baseline: 1920 s). The KPD-MADS demonstrated superior reasoning quality, receiving higher median ratings in explanatory adequacy (4.0 vs. 3.0), practical applicability (4.0 vs. 3.0), and usability (62.5 vs. 52.5). These findings show that structured multi-agent interaction can enhance reasoning rigor and interpretability in financial AI, advancing scalable and defensible automation in corporate credit assessment.

<title>Enhanced Fish Freshness Classification with Incremental Handcrafted Feature Fusion</title>

Abstract: Accurate assessment of fish freshness remains a major challenge in the food industry, with direct consequences for product quality, market value, and consumer health. Conventional sensory evaluation is inherently subjective, inconsistent, and difficult to standardize across contexts, often limited by subtle, species-dependent spoilage cues. To address these limitations, we propose a handcrafted feature-based approach that systematically extracts and incrementally fuses complementary descriptors, including color statistics, histograms across multiple color spaces, and texture features such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM), from fish eye images. Our method captures global chromatic variations from full images and localized degradations from ROI segments, fusing each independently to evaluate their effectiveness in assessing freshness. Experiments on the Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate the approach's effectiveness: in a standard train-test setting, a LightGBM classifier achieved 77.56% accuracy, a 14.35% improvement over the previous deep learning baseline of 63.21%. With augmented data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) reached 97.16% accuracy, surpassing the prior best of 77.3% by 19.86%. These results demonstrate that carefully engineered, handcrafted features, when strategically processed, yield a robust, interpretable, and reliable solution for automated fish freshness assessment, providing valuable insights for practical applications in food quality monitoring.

Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for a substantial share of global building energy use, making reliable anomaly detection essential for improving efficiency and reducing emissions. Classical rule-based approaches offer explainability but lack adaptability, while deep learning methods provide predictive power at the cost of transparency, efficiency, and physical plausibility. Recent attempts to use Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection improve interpretability but largely ignore the physical principles that govern HVAC operations. We present PILLM, a Physics-Informed LLM framework that operates within an evolutionary loop to automatically generate, evaluate, and refine anomaly detection rules. Our approach introduces physics-informed reflection and crossover operators that embed thermodynamic and control-theoretic constraints, enabling rules that are both adaptive and physically grounded. Experiments on the public Building Fault Detection dataset show that PILLM achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing diagnostic rules that are interpretable and actionable, advancing trustworthy and deployable AI for smart building systems.

<title>Which LLM Multi-Agent Protocol to Choose?</title>

Abstract: As large-scale multi-agent systems evolve, the communication protocol layer has become a critical yet under-evaluated factor shaping performance and reliability. Despite the existence of diverse protocols (A2A, ACP, ANP, Agora, etc.), selection is often intuition-driven and lacks standardized guidance. We introduce ProtocolBench, a benchmark that systematically compares agent protocols along four measurable axes: task success, end-to-end latency, message or byte overhead, and robustness under failures. On ProtocolBench, protocol choice significantly influences system behavior. In the Streaming Queue scenario, overall completion time varies by up to 36.5% across protocols, and mean end-to-end latency differs by 3.48 s. Under Fail-Storm Recovery, resilience also differs consistently across protocols. Beyond evaluation, we present ProtocolRouter, a learnable protocol router that selects per-scenario (or per-module) protocols from requirement and runtime signals. ProtocolRouter reduces Fail-Storm recovery time by up to 18.1% versus the best single-protocol baseline, and achieves scenario-specific gains such as higher success in GAIA. We also release ProtocolRouterBench to standardize protocol evaluation and improve reliability at scale.

<title>Combining ECG Foundation Model and XGBoost to Predict In-Hospital Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmias in AMI Patients</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17172</link>

Abstract: Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are a major cause of in-hospital death, yet early identification remains a clinical challenge. While traditional risk scores have limited performance, end-to-end deep learning models often lack the interpretability needed for clinical trust. This study aimed to develop a hybrid predictive framework that integrates a large-scale electrocardiogram (ECG) foundation model (ECGFounder) with an interpretable XGBoost classifier to improve both accuracy and interpretability. We analyzed 6,634 ECG recordings from AMI patients, among whom 175 experienced in-hospital VT/VF. The ECGFounder model was used to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features , which were then refined through feature selection to train the XGBoost classifier. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and F1-score , and the SHAP method was used for interpretability. The ECGFounder + XGBoost hybrid model achieved an AUC of 0.801 , outperforming KNN (AUC 0.677), RNN (AUC 0.676), and an end-to-end 1D-CNN (AUC 0.720). SHAP analysis revealed that model-identified key features, such as "premature ventricular complexes" (risk predictor) and "normal sinus rhythm" (protective factor), were highly consistent with clinical knowledge. We conclude that this hybrid framework provides a novel paradigm for VT/VF risk prediction by validating the use of foundation model outputs as effective, automated feature engineering for building trustworthy, explainable AI-based clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: We study a web-deployed, tool-augmented LLM health coach with real users. In a pilot with seven users (280 rated turns), offline policy evaluation (OPE) over factorized decision heads (Tool/Style) shows that a uniform heavy-tool policy raises average value on logs but harms specific subgroups, most notably low-health-literacy/high-self-efficacy users. A lightweight simulator with hidden archetypes further shows that adding a small early information-gain bonus reliably shortens trait identification and improves goal success and pass@3. Together, these early findings indicate an evaluation-first path to personalization: freeze the generator, learn subgroup-aware decision heads on typed rewards (objective tool outcomes and satisfaction), and always report per-archetype metrics to surface subgroup harms that averages obscure.

<title>Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural ODEs for Type 2 Diabetes Progression Modeling</title>

Abstract: Disease progression modeling aims to characterize and predict how a patient's disease complications worsen over time based on longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). Accurate modeling of disease progression, such as type 2 diabetes, can enhance patient sub-phenotyping and inform effective and timely interventions. However, the problem is challenging due to the need to learn continuous-time dynamics of progression patterns based on irregular-time event samples and patient heterogeneity (\eg different progression rates and pathways). Existing mechanistic and data-driven methods either lack adaptability to learn from real-world data or fail to capture complex continuous-time dynamics on progression trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (TD-HNODE), which represents disease progression on clinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and learns the continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework. TD-HNODE contains a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that captures the interdependency of disease complication markers within both intra- and inter-progression trajectories. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets demonstrate that TD-HNODE outperforms multiple baselines in modeling the progression of type 2 diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: The cryptocurrency market offers significant investment opportunities but faces challenges including high volatility and fragmented information. Data integration and analysis are essential for informed investment decisions. Currently, investors use three main approaches: (1) Manual analysis across various sources, which depends heavily on individual experience and is time-consuming and prone to bias; (2) Data aggregation platforms-limited in functionality and depth of analysis; (3) Large language model agents-based on static pretrained models, lacking real-time data integration and multi-step reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present Coinvisor, a reinforcement learning-based chatbot that provides comprehensive analytical support for cryptocurrency investment through a multi-agent framework. Coinvisor integrates diverse analytical capabilities through specialized tools. Its key innovation is a reinforcement learning-based tool selection mechanism that enables multi-step planning and flexible integration of diverse data sources. This design supports real-time interaction and adaptive analysis of dynamic content, delivering accurate and actionable investment insights. We evaluated Coinvisor through automated benchmarks on tool calling accuracy and user studies with 20 cryptocurrency investors using our interface. Results show that Coinvisor improves recall by 40.7% and F1 score by 26.6% over the base model in tool orchestration. User studies show high satisfaction (4.64/5), with participants preferring Coinvisor to both general LLMs and existing crypto platforms (4.62/5).

Abstract: Finding near-optimal solutions for dense multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems in real-time remains challenging even for state-of-the-art planners. To this end, we develop a hybrid framework that integrates a learned heuristic derived from MAGAT, a neural MAPF policy with a graph attention scheme, into a leading search-based algorithm, LaCAM. While prior work has explored learning-guided search in MAPF, such methods have historically underperformed. In contrast, our approach, termed LaGAT, outperforms both purely search-based and purely learning-based methods in dense scenarios. This is achieved through an enhanced MAGAT architecture, a pre-train-then-fine-tune strategy on maps of interest, and a deadlock detection scheme to account for imperfect neural guidance. Our results demonstrate that, when carefully designed, hybrid search offers a powerful solution for tightly coupled, challenging multi-agent coordination problems.

<title>Diverse Planning with Simulators via Linear Temporal Logic</title>

Abstract: Autonomous agents rely on automated planning algorithms to achieve their objectives. Simulation-based planning offers a significant advantage over declarative models in modelling complex environments. However, relying solely on a planner that produces a single plan may not be practical, as the generated plans may not always satisfy the agent's preferences. To address this limitation, we introduce $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$, a diverse planner explicitly designed for simulation-based planning problems. $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ utilises Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define semantic diversity criteria, enabling agents to specify what constitutes meaningfully different plans. By integrating these LTL-based diversity models directly into the search process, $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ ensures the generation of semantically diverse plans, addressing a critical limitation of existing diverse planning approaches that may produce syntactically different but semantically identical solutions. Extensive evaluations on various benchmarks consistently demonstrate that $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ generates more diverse plans compared to a baseline approach. This work establishes the feasibility of semantically-guided diverse planning in simulation-based environments, paving the way for innovative approaches in realistic, non-symbolic domains where traditional model-based approaches fail.

Abstract: We develop an active inference route-planning method for the autonomous control of intelligent agents. The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation, incorporating both positive and "negative" sensor observations of possible target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy, we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target objects.

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly used in the legal domain, where it typically operates retrospectively by treating past case outcomes as ground truth. However, legal outcomes are often shaped by human interventions that are not captured in most machine learning approaches. A final decision may result from a settlement, an appeal, or other procedural actions. This creates label indeterminacy: the outcome could have been different if the intervention had or had not taken place. We argue that legal machine learning applications need to account for label indeterminacy. Methods exist that can impute these indeterminate labels, but they are all grounded in unverifiable assumptions. In the context of classifying cases from the European Court of Human Rights, we show that the way that labels are constructed during training can significantly affect model behaviour. We therefore position label indeterminacy as a relevant concern in AI & Law and demonstrate how it can shape model behaviour.

<title>MIRAGE: Agentic Framework for Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Web-Grounded Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Misinformation spreads across web platforms through billions of daily multimodal posts that combine text and images, overwhelming manual fact-checking capacity. Supervised detection models require domain-specific training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation, and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples), MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65 points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97 points. Our results demonstrate that decomposed agentic reasoning with web retrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific training, enabling misinformation detection across modalities where labeled data remains scarce.

Abstract: Effective code generation with language models hinges on two critical factors: accurately understanding the intent of the prompt and generating code that applies algorithmic reasoning to produce correct solutions capable of passing diverse test cases while adhering to the syntax of the target programming language. Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires more than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level and structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely tokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed steps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial in solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller language models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities of a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to deploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution pathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem definitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware loss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation and to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap and simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model in terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across the MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.

Abstract: Clinicians need ranking systems that work in real time and still justify their choices. Motivated by the need for a low-latency, decoder-based reranker, we present OG-Rank, a single-decoder approach that pairs a pooled first-token scoring signal with an uncertainty-gated explanation step. The model scores all candidates in one pass and generates a brief, structured rationale only when the list is genuinely ambiguous, keeping latency predictable. Trained with a curriculum that concentrates effort on hard cases, OG-Rank delivers strong effectiveness on encounter-scoped order selection (fast path: Recall@1~0.45, nDCG@20~0.625) and improves further when the gate activates (Recall@1~0.56, nDCG@20~0.699 at a 45\% gate rate), while compact backbones show similar gains under the same policy. Encoder baselines trail in both effectiveness and flexibility. The result is a practical recipe: rank fast by default and explain when it helps, a pattern that applies broadly to decision tasks where selective generation buys accuracy at acceptable cost. The single-policy design simplifies deployment and budget planning, and the curriculum principle (spend more on the hard cases, less on the easy ones) readily transfers beyond clinical order selection.

Abstract: Forecasting is not only a fundamental intellectual pursuit but also is of significant importance to societal systems such as finance and economics. With the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end, we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors, consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when resolution nears.

<title>A Principle of Targeted Intervention for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards desired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a human on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On the other hand, designing mechanisms to coordinate agents most relies on empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the above issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to analyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new interaction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance can be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference technique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning paradigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.

<title>Contextual Attention Modulation: Towards Efficient Multi-Task Adaptation in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess remarkable generalization capabilities but struggle with multi-task adaptation, particularly in balancing knowledge retention with task-specific specialization. Conventional fine-tuning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering, code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance improvement of 3.65%. The implemented code and data are available to ease reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/HyCAM.

<title>Seeing but Not Believing: Probing the Disconnect Between Visual Attention and Answer Correctness in VLMs</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong results on multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, yet they can still fail even when the correct visual evidence is present. In this work, we systematically investigate whether these failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it effectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow layers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably attend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the visual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term ``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families. Building on this, we introduce an inference-time intervention that highlights deep-layer evidence regions through selective attention-based masking. It requires no training and consistently improves accuracy across multiple families, including LLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, and InternVL. These results show that VLMs encode reliable evidence internally but under-utilize it, making such signals explicit can bridge the gap between perception and reasoning, advancing the diagnostic understanding and reliability of VLMs.

<title>Readers Prefer Outputs of AI Trained on Copyrighted Books over Expert Human Writers</title>

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative content. Yet it's unclear if these models can generate high quality literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating 50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159 representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity (OR=0.16, p<10^-8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^-7) but showed mixed results with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^-13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010), with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated (3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs. While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7% reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the source works.

<title>A Semantic Generalization of Shannon's Information Theory and Applications</title>

Abstract: Does semantic communication require a semantic information theory parallel to Shannon's information theory, or can Shannon's work be generalized for semantic communication? This paper advocates for the latter and introduces a semantic generalization of Shannon's information theory (G theory for short). The core idea is to replace the distortion constraint with the semantic constraint, achieved by utilizing a set of truth functions as a semantic channel. These truth functions enable the expressions of semantic distortion, semantic information measures, and semantic information loss. Notably, the maximum semantic information criterion is equivalent to the maximum likelihood criterion and similar to the Regularized Least Squares criterion. This paper shows G theory's applications to daily and electronic semantic communication, machine learning, constraint control, Bayesian confirmation, portfolio theory, and information value. The improvements in machine learning methods involve multilabel learning and classification, maximum mutual information classification, mixture models, and solving latent variables. Furthermore, insights from statistical physics are discussed: Shannon information is similar to free energy; semantic information to free energy in local equilibrium systems; and information efficiency to the efficiency of free energy in performing work. The paper also proposes refining Friston's minimum free energy principle into the maximum information efficiency principle. Lastly, it compares G theory with other semantic information theories and discusses its limitation in representing the semantics of complex data.

Abstract: Modern chip physical design relies heavily on Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools, which often struggle to provide interpretable feedback or actionable guidance for improving routing congestion. In this work, we introduce a Multimodal Large Language Model Assistant (MLLMA) that bridges this gap by not only predicting congestion but also delivering human-interpretable design suggestions. Our method combines automated feature generation through MLLM-guided genetic prompting with an interpretable preference learning framework that models congestion-relevant tradeoffs across visual, tabular, and textual inputs. We compile these insights into a "Design Suggestion Deck" that surfaces the most influential layout features and proposes targeted optimizations. Experiments on the CircuitNet benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing models on both accuracy and explainability. Additionally, our design suggestion guidance case study and qualitative analyses confirm that the learned preferences align with real-world design principles and are actionable for engineers. This work highlights the potential of MLLMs as interactive assistants for interpretable and context-aware physical design optimization.

<title>FlexLink: Boosting your NVLink Bandwidth by 27% without accuracy concern</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, multi-node deployment has become a necessity. Consequently, communication has become a critical performance bottleneck. Current intra-node communication libraries, like NCCL, typically make use of a single interconnect such as NVLink. This approach creates performance ceilings, especially on hardware like the H800 GPU where the primary interconnect's bandwidth can become a bottleneck, and leaves other hardware resources like PCIe and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)-capable Network Interface Cards (NICs) largely idle during intensive workloads. We propose FlexLink, the first collective communication framework to the best of our knowledge designed to systematically address this by aggregating these heterogeneous links-NVLink, PCIe, and RDMA NICs-into a single, high-performance communication fabric. FlexLink employs an effective two-stage adaptive load balancing strategy that dynamically partitions communication traffic across all available links, ensuring that faster interconnects are not throttled by slower ones. On an 8-GPU H800 server, our design improves the bandwidth of collective operators such as AllReduce and AllGather by up to 26% and 27% over the NCCL baseline, respectively. This gain is achieved by offloading 2-22% of the total communication traffic to the previously underutilized PCIe and RDMA NICs. FlexLink provides these improvements as a lossless, drop-in replacement compatible with the NCCL API, ensuring easy adoption.

Abstract: Traditional stochastic control methods in finance struggle in real world markets due to their reliance on simplifying assumptions and stylized frameworks. Such methods typically perform well in specific, well defined environments but yield suboptimal results in changed, non stationary ones. We introduce FinFlowRL, a novel framework for financial optimal stochastic control. The framework pretrains an adaptive meta policy learning from multiple expert strategies, then finetunes through reinforcement learning in the noise space to optimize the generative process. By employing action chunking generating action sequences rather than single decisions, it addresses the non Markovian nature of markets. FinFlowRL consistently outperforms individually optimized experts across diverse market conditions.

Abstract: The escalating demand for personalized AI chatbot interactions, capable of dynamically adapting to user emotional states and real-time requests, has highlighted critical limitations in current development paradigms. Existing methodologies, which rely on baseline programming, custom personalities, and manual response adjustments, often prove difficult to maintain and are susceptible to errors such as hallucinations, erratic outputs, and software bugs. This paper hypothesizes that a framework rooted in human psychological principles, specifically therapeutic modalities, can provide a more robust and sustainable solution than purely technical interventions. Drawing an analogy to the simulated neural networks of AI mirroring the human brain, we propose the application of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) principles to regulate chatbot responses to diverse user inputs. This research investigates the impact of a DBT-based framework on AI chatbot performance, aiming to ascertain its efficacy in yielding more reliable, safe, and accurate responses, while mitigating the occurrence of hallucinations, erratic behaviors, and other systemic issues.

Abstract: This study presents a real-time, portable brain-computer interface (BCI) system designed to support hand rehabilitation for stroke patients. The system combines a low cost 3D-printed robotic exoskeleton with an embedded controller that converts brain signals into physical hand movements. EEG signals are recorded using a 14-channel Emotiv EPOC+ headset and processed through a supervised convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to extract meaningful latent features from single-trial data. The model is trained on publicly available EEG data from healthy individuals (WAY-EEG-GAL dataset), with electrode mapping adapted to match the Emotiv headset layout. Among several tested classifiers, Ada Boost achieved the highest accuracy (89.3%) and F1-score (0.89) in offline evaluations. The system was also tested in real time on five healthy subjects, achieving classification accuracies between 60% and 86%. The complete pipeline - EEG acquisition, signal processing, classification, and robotic control - is deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform with a real-time graphical interface. These results demonstrate the system's potential as a low-cost, standalone solution for home-based neurorehabilitation.

Abstract: AI companions powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily lives, offering emotional support and companionship. While existing safety systems focus on overt harms, they rarely address early-stage problematic behaviors that can foster unhealthy emotional dynamics, including over-attachment or reinforcement of social isolation. We developed SHIELD (Supervisory Helper for Identifying Emotional Limits and Dynamics), a LLM-based supervisory system with a specific system prompt that detects and mitigates risky emotional patterns before escalation. SHIELD targets five dimensions of concern: (1) emotional over-attachment, (2) consent and boundary violations, (3) ethical roleplay violations, (4) manipulative engagement, and (5) social isolation reinforcement. These dimensions were defined based on media reports, academic literature, existing AI risk frameworks, and clinical expertise in unhealthy relationship dynamics. To evaluate SHIELD, we created a 100-item synthetic conversation benchmark covering all five dimensions of concern. Testing across five prominent LLMs (GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemma 3 1B, Kimi K2, Llama Scout 4 17B) showed that the baseline rate of concerning content (10-16%) was significantly reduced with SHIELD (to 3-8%), a 50-79% relative reduction, while preserving 95% of appropriate interactions. The system achieved 59% sensitivity and 95% specificity, with adaptable performance via prompt engineering. This proof-of-concept demonstrates that transparent, deployable supervisory systems can address subtle emotional manipulation in AI companions. Most development materials including prompts, code, and evaluation methods are made available as open source materials for research, adaptation, and deployment.

Abstract: The unabated growth in AI workload demands is driving the need for concerted advances in compute, memory, and interconnect performance. As traditional semiconductor scaling slows, high-speed interconnects have emerged as the new scaling engine, enabling the creation of larger logical GPUs by linking many GPUs into a single, low-latency, high-bandwidth compute domain. While initial scale-up fabrics leveraged copper interconnects for their power and cost advantages, the maximum reach of passive electrical interconnects (approximately 1 meter) effectively limits the scale-up domain to within a single rack. The advent of 3D-stacked optics and logic offers a transformative, power-efficient scale-up solution for connecting hundreds of GPU packages (thousands of GPUs) across multiple data center racks. This work explores the design tradeoffs of scale-up technologies and demonstrates how frontier LLMs necessitate novel photonic solutions to achieve aggressive power and performance targets. We model the benefits of 3D CPO (Passage) enabled GPUs and switches within the scale-up domain when training Frontier Mixture of Experts (MoE) models exceeding one trillion parameters. Our results show that the substantial increases in bandwidth and radix enabled by 3D CPO allow for an 8X increase in scale-up capability. This affords new opportunities for multi-dimensional parallelism within the scale-up domain and results in a 2.7X reduction in time-to-train, unlocking unprecedented model scaling.

Abstract: We present a multimodal system for personalized music generation that integrates physiological sensing, LLM-based reasoning, and controllable audio synthesis. A millimeter-wave radar sensor non-invasively captures heart rate and respiration rate. These physiological signals, combined with environmental state, are interpreted by a reasoning agent to infer symbolic musical descriptors, such as tempo, mood intensity, and traditional Chinese pentatonic modes, which are then expressed as structured prompts to guide a diffusion-based audio model in synthesizing expressive melodies. The system emphasizes cultural grounding through tonal embeddings and enables adaptive, embodied music interaction. To evaluate the system, we adopt a research-creation methodology combining case studies, expert feedback, and targeted control experiments. Results show that physiological variations can modulate musical features in meaningful ways, and tonal conditioning enhances alignment with intended modal characteristics. Expert users reported that the system affords intuitive, culturally resonant musical responses and highlighted its potential for therapeutic and interactive applications. This work demonstrates a novel bio-musical feedback loop linking radar-based sensing, prompt reasoning, and generative audio modeling.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Efficient task allocation in hospital emergency departments (EDs) is critical for operational efficiency and patient care quality, yet the complexity of staff coordination poses significant challenges. This study proposes a simulation-based framework for modeling doctors and nurses as intelligent agents guided by computational trust mechanisms. The objective is to explore how trust-informed coordination can support decision making in ED management. Methods: The framework was implemented in Unity, a 3D graphics platform, where agents assess their competence before undertaking tasks and adaptively coordinate with colleagues. The simulation environment enables real-time observation of workflow dynamics, resource utilization, and patient outcomes. We examined three scenarios - Baseline, Replacement, and Training - reflecting alternative staff management strategies. Results: Trust-informed task allocation balanced patient safety and efficiency by adapting to nurse performance levels. In the Baseline scenario, prioritizing safety reduced errors but increased patient delays compared to a FIFO policy. The Replacement scenario improved throughput and reduced delays, though at additional staffing cost. The training scenario forstered long-term skill development among low-performing nurses, despite short-term delays and risks. These results highlight the trade-off between immediate efficiency gains and sustainable capacity building in ED staffing. Conclusions: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of computational trust for evidence-based decision support in emergency medicine. By linking staff coordination with adaptive decision making, it provides hospital managers with a tool to evaluate alternative policies under controlled and repeatable conditions, while also laying a foundation for future AI-driven personalized decision support.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for both task-based assistance and social companionship, yet research has typically focused on one or the other. Drawing on a survey (N = 204) and 30 interviews with high-engagement ChatGPT and Replika users, we characterize digital companionship as an emerging form of human-AI relationship. With both systems, users were drawn to humanlike qualities, such as emotional resonance and personalized responses, and non-humanlike qualities, such as constant availability and inexhaustible tolerance. This led to fluid chatbot uses, such as Replika as a writing assistant and ChatGPT as an emotional confidant, despite their distinct branding. However, we observed challenging tensions in digital companionship dynamics: participants grappled with bounded personhood, forming deep attachments while denying chatbots "real" human qualities, and struggled to reconcile chatbot relationships with social norms. These dynamics raise questions for the design of digital companions and the rise of hybrid, general-purpose AI systems.

Abstract: Debugging formal verification (FV) failures represents one of the most time-consuming bottlenecks in modern hardware design workflows. When properties fail, engineers must manually trace through complex counter-examples spanning multiple cycles, analyze waveforms, and cross-reference design specifications to identify root causes - a process that can consume hours or days per bug. Existing solutions are largely limited to manual waveform viewers or simple automated tools that cannot reason about the complex interplay between design intent and implementation logic. We present FVDebug, an intelligent system that automates root-cause analysis by combining multiple data sources - waveforms, RTL code, design specifications - to transform failure traces into actionable insights. Our approach features a novel pipeline: (1) Causal Graph Synthesis that structures failure traces into directed acyclic graphs, (2) Graph Scanner using batched Large Language Model (LLM) analysis with for-and-against prompting to identify suspicious nodes, and (3) Insight Rover leveraging agentic narrative exploration to generate high-level causal explanations. FVDebug further provides concrete RTL fixes through its Fix Generator. Evaluated on open benchmarks, FVDebug attains high hypothesis quality and strong Pass@k fix rates. We further report results on two proprietary, production-scale FV counterexamples. These results demonstrate FVDebug's applicability from academic benchmarks to industrial designs.

Abstract: The Sleeping Beauty problem was presented by Elga and highlights the role of probabilities in situations with imperfect recall. One approach to solving the Sleeping Beauty problem is to allow Sleeping Beauty to make decisions based on her beliefs, and then characterize what it takes for her decisions to be "rational". In particular, she can be allowed to make monetary bets based on her beliefs, with the assumption that she wants to gain wealth rather than lose it. However, this approach is often coupled with the assumption that Sleeping Beauty should maximize the expected value of her bets. Here, I argue instead that it is rational for Sleeping Beauty to maximize the growth rate of her wealth using the Kelly Criterion, which leads us to the "thirder" position. Furthermore, this position is shown to be "rational" by Dutch book arguments. If Sleeping Kelly only accepts bets that have a growth rate greater than 1 as a "thirder" then she is not vulnerable to Dutch books. By contrast, if Sleeping Beauty takes the "halfer" position, she is vulnerable to Dutch books. If the bets offered to Sleeping Beauty were to be structured differently and lead to non-multiplicative wealth dynamics, she may no longer be a "thirder".

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating Verilog code from natural language descriptions. However, Verilog code inherently encodes structural information of hardware circuits. Effectively leveraging this structural information to enhance the functional and syntactic correctness of LLM-generated Verilog code remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose VeriGRAG , a novel framework that extracts structural graph embeddings from Verilog code using graph neural networks (GNNs). A multimodal retriever then selects the graph embeddings most relevant to the given generation task, which are aligned with the code modality through the VeriFormer module to generate structure-aware soft prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that VeriGRAG substantially improves the correctness of Verilog code generation, achieving state-of-the-art or superior performance across both VerilogEval and RTLLM benchmarks.

Abstract: Existing storage systems lack visibility into workload intent, limiting their ability to adapt to the semantics of modern, large-scale data-intensive applications. This disconnect leads to brittle heuristics and fragmented, siloed optimizations. To address these limitations, we propose Intent-Driven Storage Systems (IDSS), a vision for a new paradigm where large language models (LLMs) infer workload and system intent from unstructured signals to guide adaptive and cross-layer parameter reconfiguration. IDSS provides holistic reasoning for competing demands, synthesizing safe and efficient decisions within policy guardrails. We present four design principles for integrating LLMs into storage control loops and propose a corresponding system architecture. Initial results on FileBench workloads show that IDSS can improve IOPS by up to 2.45X by interpreting intent and generating actionable configurations for storage components such as caching and prefetching. These findings suggest that, when constrained by guardrails and embedded within structured workflows, LLMs can function as high-level semantic optimizers, bridging the gap between application goals and low-level system control. IDSS points toward a future in which storage systems are increasingly adaptive, autonomous, and aligned with dynamic workload demands.

Abstract: Implementing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) has emerged as a promising alternative to GPUs, offering lower latency, greater power efficiency and greater flexibility. However, this development remains complex due to the hardware knowledge required and the long synthesis, placement and routing stages, which slow down design cycles and prevent rapid exploration of network configurations, making resource optimisation under severe constraints particularly challenging. This paper proposes a library of configurable convolution Blocks designed to optimize FPGA implementation and adapt to available resources. It also presents a methodological framework for developing mathematical models that predict FPGA resources utilization. The approach is validated by analyzing the correlation between the parameters, followed by error metrics. The results show that the designed blocks enable adaptation of convolution layers to hardware constraints, and that the models accurately predict resource consumption, providing a useful tool for FPGA selection and optimized CNN deployment.

Abstract: We present Lean Finder, a semantic search engine for Lean and mathlib that understands and aligns with the intents of mathematicians. Progress in formal theorem proving is often hindered by the difficulty of locating relevant theorems and the steep learning curve of the Lean 4 language, making advancement slow and labor-intensive. Existing Lean search engines, though helpful, rely primarily on informalizations (natural language translation of the formal statements), while largely overlooking the mismatch with real-world user queries. In contrast, we propose a user-centered semantic search tailored to the needs of mathematicians. Our approach begins by analyzing and clustering the semantics of public Lean discussions, then fine-tuning text embeddings on synthesized queries that emulate user intents. We further align Lean Finder with mathematicians' preferences using diverse feedback signals, encoding it with a rich awareness of their goals from multiple perspectives. Evaluations on real-world queries, informalized statements, and proof states demonstrate that our Lean Finder achieves over $30\%$ relative improvement compared to previous search engines and GPT-4o. In addition, Lean Finder is compatible with LLM-based theorem provers, bridging retrieval with formal reasoning. Lean Finder is available at: https://leanfinder.github.io

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often struggle in non-stationary environments due to concept drift, where changing data distributions can degrade performance. Modality-specific drifts and the lack of mechanisms for continuous, stable adaptation compound this challenge. This paper introduces LS-OGD, a novel adaptive control framework for robust multimodal learning in the presence of concept drift. LS-OGD uses an online controller that dynamically adjusts the model's learning rate and the fusion weights between different data modalities in response to detected drift and evolving prediction errors. We prove that under bounded drift conditions, the LS-OGD system's prediction error is uniformly ultimately bounded and converges to zero if the drift ceases. Additionally, we demonstrate that the adaptive fusion strategy effectively isolates and mitigates the impact of severe modality-specific drift, thereby ensuring system resilience and fault tolerance. These theoretical guarantees establish a principled foundation for developing reliable and continuously adapting multimodal learning systems.

Abstract: Sampling multiple responses is a common way to improve LLM output quality, but it comes at the cost of additional computation. The key challenge is deciding when to stop generating new samples to balance accuracy gains against efficiency. To address this, we introduce BEACON (Bayesian Efficient Adaptive Criterion for Optimal N-stopping), a principled adaptive sampling framework grounded in Sequential Search with Bayesian Learning. BEACON sequentially generates responses from the policy LLM, updates posterior belief over reward distributions in real time without further training, and determines when to stop by weighing expected gains against computational cost. Sampling terminates once the marginal utility of further exploration no longer justifies the expense. We establish both theoretical optimality guarantees and practical tractability, and show empirically that BEACON reduces average sampling by up to 80% while maintaining response quality. We further demonstrate BEACON's utility for cost-efficient preference data generation and outline practical extensions, offering actionable insights for future researchers.

Abstract: Internet memes have emerged as a popular multimodal medium, yet they are increasingly weaponized to convey harmful opinions through subtle rhetorical devices like irony and metaphor. Existing detection approaches, including MLLM-based techniques, struggle with these implicit expressions, leading to frequent misjudgments. This paper introduces PatMD, a novel approach that improves harmful meme detection by learning from and proactively mitigating these potential misjudgment risks. Our core idea is to move beyond superficial content-level matching and instead identify the underlying misjudgment risk patterns, proactively guiding the MLLMs to avoid known misjudgment pitfalls. We first construct a knowledge base where each meme is deconstructed into a misjudgment risk pattern explaining why it might be misjudged, either overlooking harmful undertones (false negative) or overinterpreting benign content (false positive). For a given target meme, PatMD retrieves relevant patterns and utilizes them to dynamically guide the MLLM's reasoning. Experiments on a benchmark of 6,626 memes across 5 harmful detection tasks show that PatMD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average of 8.30\% improvement in F1-score and 7.71\% improvement in accuracy, demonstrating strong generalizability and improved detection capability of harmful memes.

Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to automate the classification of EEG signals into physiological, pathological, artifact, and noise categories. Traditional methods for EEG signal classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of EEG recordings. Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St. Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and tested on 209,232 samples with a 70/20/10 percent split. The model achieved a classification accuracy exceeding previous CNN and LSTM-based approaches, and was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline. Notably, the model distinguishes noise and artifacts with high precision, although it reveals a modest but explainable degree of misclassification between physiological and pathological signals, reflecting inherent clinical overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis, is well suited for EEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and residual connections, enabling it to capture both fine-grained and long-range temporal dependencies. The research also details the preprocessing pipeline, including dynamic dataset partitioning and normalization steps that support model generalization.

Abstract: Large language models show promise for financial decision-making, yet deploying them as autonomous trading agents raises fundamental challenges: how to adapt instructions when rewards arrive late and obscured by market noise, how to synthesize heterogeneous information streams into coherent decisions, and how to bridge the gap between model outputs and executable market actions. We present ATLAS (Adaptive Trading with LLM AgentS), a unified multi-agent framework that integrates structured information from markets, news, and corporate fundamentals to support robust trading decisions. Within ATLAS, the central trading agent operates in an order-aware action space, ensuring that outputs correspond to executable market orders rather than abstract signals. The agent can incorporate feedback while trading using Adaptive-OPRO, a novel prompt-optimization technique that dynamically adapts the prompt by incorporating real-time, stochastic feedback, leading to increasing performance over time. Across regime-specific equity studies and multiple LLM families, Adaptive-OPRO consistently outperforms fixed prompts, while reflection-based feedback fails to provide systematic gains.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) presents a growing global challenge, affecting over 10 million individuals, with prevalence expected to double by 2040. Early diagnosis remains difficult due to the late emergence of motor symptoms and limitations of traditional clinical assessments. In this study, we propose a novel pipeline that leverages keystroke dynamics as a non-invasive and scalable biomarker for remote PD screening and telemonitoring. Our methodology involves three main stages: (i) preprocessing of data from four distinct datasets, extracting four temporal signals and addressing class imbalance through the comparison of three methods; (ii) pre-training eight state-of-the-art deep-learning architectures on the two largest datasets, optimizing temporal windowing, stride, and other hyperparameters; (iii) fine-tuning on an intermediate-sized dataset and performing external validation on a fourth, independent cohort. Our results demonstrate that hybrid convolutional-recurrent and transformer-based models achieve strong external validation performance, with AUC-ROC scores exceeding 90% and F1-Score over 70%. Notably, a temporal convolutional model attains an AUC-ROC of 91.14% in external validation, outperforming existing methods that rely solely on internal validation. These findings underscore the potential of keystroke dynamics as a reliable digital biomarker for PD, offering a promising avenue for early detection and continuous monitoring.

Abstract: Most realistic task automation problems require large language models (LLMs) to call tools, which often return complex JSON responses. These responses must be further processed to derive the information necessary for task completion. The ability of LLMs to do so is under-studied. In this paper, we study the tool response processing task and LLMs' abilities to process structured (JSON) responses. We created a dataset for this task, and evaluated 15 open and closed weight models using multiple prompting approaches. Our results show that JSON processing remains a difficult task even for frontier models across multiple prompting strategies. The optimal response processing strategy depends on both the nature and size of the tool outputs, as well as the complexity of the required reasoning. Variations in processing approaches can lead to performance differences ranging from 3\% to 50\%.

<title>Interpretable Graph-Language Modeling for Detecting Youth Illicit Drug Use</title>

Abstract: Illicit drug use among teenagers and young adults (TYAs) remains a pressing public health concern, with rising prevalence and long-term impacts on health and well-being. To detect illicit drug use among TYAs, researchers analyze large-scale surveys such as the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which preserve rich demographic, psychological, and environmental factors related to substance use. However, existing modeling methods treat survey variables independently, overlooking latent and interconnected structures among them. To address this limitation, we propose LAMI (LAtent relation Mining with bi-modal Interpretability), a novel joint graph-language modeling framework for detecting illicit drug use and interpreting behavioral risk factors among TYAs. LAMI represents individual responses as relational graphs, learns latent connections through a specialized graph structure learning layer, and integrates a large language model to generate natural language explanations grounded in both graph structures and survey semantics. Experiments on the YRBS and NSDUH datasets show that LAMI outperforms competitive baselines in predictive accuracy. Interpretability analyses further demonstrate that LAMI reveals meaningful behavioral substructures and psychosocial pathways, such as family dynamics, peer influence, and school-related distress, that align with established risk factors for substance use.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become the standard approach for adapting large language models under limited compute and memory budgets. Although previous methods improve efficiency through low-rank updates, quantization, or heuristic budget reallocation, they often decouple the allocation of capacity from the way updates evolve during training. In this work, we introduce CTR-LoRA, a framework guided by curvature trust region that integrates rank scheduling with stability-aware optimization. CTR-LoRA allocates parameters based on marginal utility derived from lightweight second-order proxies and constrains updates using a Fisher/Hessian-metric trust region. Experiments on multiple open-source backbones (7B-13B), evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, show consistent improvements over strong PEFT baselines. In addition to increased accuracy, CTR-LoRA enhances training stability, reduces memory requirements, and achieves higher throughput, positioning it on the Pareto frontier of performance and efficiency. These results highlight a principled path toward more robust and deployable PEFT.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward general-purpose embodied agents. However, current training pipelines primarily rely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured alignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics. To overcome this challenge, we propose ESCA, a new framework for contextualizing embodied agents through structured spatial-temporal understanding. At its core is SGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating scene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic learning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from video-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for human-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGClip consistently improves both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance across two embodied environments. Notably, it significantly reduces agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary baselines.

Abstract: The adaptation of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to diverse downstream tasks via fine-tuning is critical for numerous applications. However, the inefficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques presents significant challenges in terms of time investments and operational costs. In this paper, we first introduce a nuanced form of sparsity, termed Shadowy Sparsity, which is distinctive in fine-tuning and has not been adequately addressed for acceleration. Under Shadowy Sparsity, we propose Long Exposure, an efficient system to accelerate PEFT for LLMs. Long Exposure comprises three key components: Shadowy-sparsity Exposer employs a prolonged sensing range to capture more sparsity details under shadowy sparsity; Sequence-oriented Predictor provides efficient yet accurate predictions to handle large sequence inputs and constantly-evolving parameters; and Dynamic-aware Operator facilitates more structured computational patterns and coalesced memory accesses, addressing dynamic sparse operations. Extensive evaluations show that Long Exposure outperforms state-of-the-arts with up to a $2.49\times$ speedup in end-to-end fine-tuning, offering promising advancements in accelerating PEFT for LLMs.

Abstract: Modern large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit impressive multi-step problem-solving via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this iterative thinking mechanism introduces a new vulnerability surface. We present the Deadlock Attack, a resource exhaustion method that hijacks an LRM's generative control flow by training a malicious adversarial embedding to induce perpetual reasoning loops. Specifically, the optimized embedding encourages transitional tokens (e.g., "Wait", "But") after reasoning steps, preventing the model from concluding its answer. A key challenge we identify is the continuous-to-discrete projection gap: na\"ive projections of adversarial embeddings to token sequences nullify the attack. To overcome this, we introduce a backdoor implantation strategy, enabling reliable activation through specific trigger tokens. Our method achieves a 100% attack success rate across four advanced LRMs (Phi-RM, Nemotron-Nano, R1-Qwen, R1-Llama) and three math reasoning benchmarks, forcing models to generate up to their maximum token limits. The attack is also stealthy (in terms of causing negligible utility loss on benign user inputs) and remains robust against existing strategies trying to mitigate the overthinking issue. Our findings expose a critical and underexplored security vulnerability in LRMs from the perspective of reasoning (in)efficiency.

Abstract: Conventional federated learning (FL) assumes a closed world with a fixed total number of clients. In contrast, new clients continuously join the FL process in real-world scenarios, introducing new knowledge. This raises two critical demands: detecting new knowledge, i.e., knowledge discovery, and integrating it into the global model, i.e., knowledge adaptation. Existing research focuses on coarse-grained knowledge discovery, and often sacrifices source domain performance and adaptation efficiency. To this end, we propose a fine-grained federated domain adaptation approach in open set (Gains). Gains splits the model into an encoder and a classifier, empirically revealing features extracted by the encoder are sensitive to domain shifts while classifier parameters are sensitive to class increments. Based on this, we develop fine-grained knowledge discovery and contribution-driven aggregation techniques to identify and incorporate new knowledge. Additionally, an anti-forgetting mechanism is designed to preserve source domain performance, ensuring balanced adaptation. Experimental results on multi-domain datasets across three typical data-shift scenarios demonstrate that Gains significantly outperforms other baselines in performance for both source-domain and target-domain clients. Code is available at: https://github.com/Zhong-Zhengyi/Gains.

Abstract: Thermal management in 3D ICs is increasingly challenging due to higher power densities. Traditional PDE-solving-based methods, while accurate, are too slow for iterative design. Machine learning approaches like FNO provide faster alternatives but suffer from high-frequency information loss and high-fidelity data dependency. We introduce Self-Attention U-Net Fourier Neural Operator (SAU-FNO), a novel framework combining self-attention and U-Net with FNO to capture long-range dependencies and model local high-frequency features effectively. Transfer learning is employed to fine-tune low-fidelity data, minimizing the need for extensive high-fidelity datasets and speeding up training. Experiments demonstrate that SAU-FNO achieves state-of-the-art thermal prediction accuracy and provides an 842x speedup over traditional FEM methods, making it an efficient tool for advanced 3D IC thermal simulations.

Abstract: Reformulating nonlinear optimization problems is largely manual and expertise-intensive, yet it remains essential for solving such problems with linear optimization solvers or applying special-purpose algorithms. We introduce \textit{LinearizeLLM}, an agent-based framework that solves this task by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework assigns each nonlinear pattern to a \textit{reformulation agent} that is explicitly instructed to derive an exact linear reformulation for its nonlinearity pattern, for instance, absolute-value terms or bilinear products of decision variables. The agents then coordinate to assemble a solver-ready linear model equivalent to the original problem. To benchmark the approach, we create a dataset of 20 real-world nonlinear optimization problems derived from the established ComplexOR dataset of linear optimization problems. We evaluate our approach with several LLMs. Our results indicate that specialized LLM agents can automate linearization tasks, opening a path toward fully conversational modeling pipelines for nonlinear optimization.

Abstract: High-quality training data is the foundation of machine learning and artificial intelligence, shaping how models learn and perform. Although much is known about what types of data are effective for training, the impact of the data's geometric structure on model performance remains largely underexplored. We propose that both the richness of representation and the elimination of redundancy within training data critically influence learning outcomes. To investigate this, we employ persistent homology to extract topological features from data within a metric space, thereby offering a principled way to quantify diversity beyond entropy-based measures. Our findings highlight persistent homology as a powerful tool for analyzing and enhancing the training data that drives AI systems.

Abstract: Malicious URLs pose significant security risks as they facilitate phishing attacks, distribute malware, and empower attackers to deface websites. Blacklist detection methods fail to identify new or obfuscated URLs because they depend on pre-existing patterns. This work presents a hybrid deep learning model named GNN-GAT-LSTM that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed architecture extracts both the structural and sequential patterns of the features from data. The model transforms URLs into graphs through a process where characters become nodes that connect through edges. It applies one-hot encoding to represent node features. The model received training and testing data from a collection of 651,191 URLs, which were classified into benign, phishing, defacement, and malware categories. The preprocessing stage included both feature engineering and data balancing techniques, which addressed the class imbalance issue to enhance model learning. The GNN-GAT-LSTM model achieved outstanding performance through its test accuracy of 0.9806 and its weighted F1-score of 0.9804. It showed excellent precision and recall performance across most classes, particularly for benign and defacement URLs. Overall, the model provides an efficient and scalable system for detecting malicious URLs while demonstrating strong potential for real-world cybersecurity applications.

Abstract: Quantum natural language processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to semantic modeling by embedding compositional structure directly into quantum circuits. This paper investigates the application of QNLP models to the task of Natural Language Inference (NLI), comparing quantum, hybrid, and classical transformer-based models under a constrained few-shot setting. Using the lambeq library and the DisCoCat framework, we construct parameterized quantum circuits for sentence pairs and train them for both semantic relatedness and inference classification. To assess efficiency, we introduce a novel information-theoretic metric, Information Gain per Parameter (IGPP), which quantifies learning dynamics independent of model size. Our results demonstrate that quantum models achieve performance comparable to classical baselines while operating with dramatically fewer parameters. The Quantum-based models outperform randomly initialized transformers in inference and achieve lower test error on relatedness tasks. Moreover, quantum models exhibit significantly higher per-parameter learning efficiency (up to five orders of magnitude more than classical counterparts), highlighting the promise of QNLP in low-resource, structure-sensitive settings. To address circuit-level isolation and promote parameter sharing, we also propose a novel cluster-based architecture that improves generalization by tying gate parameters to learned word clusters rather than individual tokens.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic security assessment of four prominent Large Language Models (LLMs) against diverse adversarial attack vectors. We evaluate Phi-2, Llama-2-7B-Chat, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and GPT-4 across four distinct attack categories: human-written prompts, AutoDAN, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), and Tree-of-Attacks-with-pruning (TAP). Our comprehensive evaluation employs 1,200 carefully stratified prompts from the SALAD-Bench dataset, spanning six harm categories. Results demonstrate significant variations in model robustness, with Llama-2 achieving the highest overall security (3.4% average attack success rate) while Phi-2 exhibits the greatest vulnerability (7.0% average attack success rate). We identify critical transferability patterns where GCG and TAP attacks, though ineffective against their target model (Llama-2), achieve substantially higher success rates when transferred to other models (up to 17% for GPT-4). Statistical analysis using Friedman tests reveals significant differences in vulnerability across harm categories ($p < 0.001$), with malicious use prompts showing the highest attack success rates (10.71% average). Our findings contribute to understanding cross-model security vulnerabilities and provide actionable insights for developing targeted defense mechanisms

Abstract: The rapid development of LLMs has raised concerns about their potential misuse, leading to various watermarking schemes that typically offer high detectability. However, existing watermarking techniques often face trade-off between watermark detectability and generated text quality. In this paper, we introduce Learning to Watermark (LTW), a novel selective watermarking framework that leverages multi-objective optimization to effectively balance these competing goals. LTW features a lightweight network that adaptively decides when to apply the watermark by analyzing sentence embeddings, token entropy, and current watermarking ratio. Training of the network involves two specifically constructed loss functions that guide the model toward Pareto-optimal solutions, thereby harmonizing watermark detectability and text quality. By integrating LTW with two baseline watermarking methods, our experimental evaluations demonstrate that LTW significantly enhances text quality without compromising detectability. Our selective watermarking approach offers a new perspective for designing watermarks for LLMs and a way to preserve high text quality for watermarks.

<title>Bolster Hallucination Detection via Prompt-Guided Data Augmentation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant interest in AI community. Despite their impressive generation capabilities, they have been found to produce misleading or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as hallucinations. Consequently, hallucination detection has become critical to ensure the reliability of LLM-generated content. One primary challenge in hallucination detection is the scarcity of well-labeled datasets containing both truthful and hallucinated outputs. To address this issue, we introduce Prompt-guided data Augmented haLlucination dEtection (PALE), a novel framework that leverages prompt-guided responses from LLMs as data augmentation for hallucination detection. This strategy can generate both truthful and hallucinated data under prompt guidance at a relatively low cost. To more effectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings produced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive Mahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions of truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a matrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying structure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require additional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PALE achieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the competitive baseline by a significant margin of 6.55%.

<title>DAWP: A framework for global observation forecasting via Data Assimilation and Weather Prediction in satellite observation space</title>

Abstract: Weather prediction is a critical task for human society, where impressive progress has been made by training artificial intelligence weather prediction (AIWP) methods with reanalysis data. However, reliance on reanalysis data limits the AIWPs with shortcomings, including data assimilation biases and temporal discrepancies. To liberate AIWPs from the reanalysis data, observation forecasting emerges as a transformative paradigm for weather prediction. One of the key challenges in observation forecasting is learning spatiotemporal dynamics across disparate measurement systems with irregular high-resolution observation data, which constrains the design and prediction of AIWPs. To this end, we propose our DAWP as an innovative framework to enable AIWPs to operate in a complete observation space by initialization with an artificial intelligence data assimilation (AIDA) module. Specifically, our AIDA module applies a mask multi-modality autoencoder(MMAE)for assimilating irregular satellite observation tokens encoded by mask ViT-VAEs. For AIWP, we introduce a spatiotemporal decoupling transformer with cross-regional boundary conditioning (CBC), learning the dynamics in observation space, to enable sub-image-based global observation forecasting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AIDA initialization significantly improves the roll out and efficiency of AIWP. Additionally, we show that DAWP holds promising potential to be applied in global precipitation forecasting.

Abstract: Contemporary progress in large language models (LLMs) has revealed notable inferential capacities via reinforcement learning (RL) employing verifiable reward, facilitating the development of O1 and R1-like reasoning models. Directly training from base models with RL is called zero-RL. However, previous works rely upon activating LLMs' inherent capacities through fixed prompt templates. This strategy introduces substantial sampling inefficiencies for weak LLMs, as the majority of problems generate invalid outputs during accuracy-driven filtration in reasoning tasks, which causes a waste of samples. To solve this issue, we propose Cog-Rethinker, a novel hierarchical metacognitive RL framework for LLM reasoning. Our Cog-Rethinker mainly focuses on the rollout procedure in RL training. After the direct rollout, our Cog-Rethinker improves sample utilization in a hierarchical metacognitive two-stage framework. By leveraging human cognition during solving problems, firstly, it prompts policy to decompose zero-accuracy problems into subproblems to produce final reasoning results. Secondly, with zero-accuracy problems in previous rollout stage, it further prompts policy to refine these answers by referencing previous wrong solutions. Moreover, to enable cold-start of the two new reasoning patterns and maintain train-test consistency across prompt templates, our Cog-Rethinker applies supervised fine-tuning on the policy using correct samples of the two stages with direct rollout template. Experimental results demonstrate Cog-Rethinker's superior performance on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we also analyzed its improved sample efficiency that accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

<title>AMiD: Knowledge Distillation for LLMs with $\alpha$-mixture Assistant Distribution</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15982</link>

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable improvement across many tasks but incur high computational and memory costs. Knowledge distillation (KD) mitigates this issue by transferring knowledge from a large teacher to a smaller student through distributional alignment. Previous studies have proposed various discrepancy metrics, but the capacity gap and training instability caused by near-zero probabilities, stemming from the high-dimensional output of LLMs, remain fundamental limitations. To overcome these challenges, several approaches implicitly or explicitly incorporating assistant distribution have recently been proposed. However, the past proposals of assistant distributions have been a fragmented approach without a systematic investigation of the interpolation path and the divergence. This paper proposes $\alpha$-mixture assistant distribution, a novel generalized family of assistant distributions, and $\alpha$-mixture distillation, coined AMiD, a unified framework for KD using the assistant distribution. The $\alpha$-mixture assistant distribution provides a continuous extension of the assistant distribution by introducing a new distribution design variable $\alpha$, which has been fixed in all previous approaches. Furthermore, AMiD generalizes the family of divergences used with the assistant distributions based on optimality, which has also been restricted in previous works. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AMiD offers superior performance and training stability by leveraging a broader and theoretically grounded assistant distribution space.

Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening infectious syndrome associated with high mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). Early and accurate sepsis prediction (SP) is critical for timely intervention, yet remains challenging due to subtle early manifestations and rapidly escalating mortality. While AI has improved SP efficiency, existing methods struggle to capture weak early temporal signals. This paper introduces a Multi-Endogenous-view Representation Enhancement (MERE) mechanism to construct enriched feature views, coupled with a Cascaded Dual-convolution Time-series Attention (CDTA) module for multi-scale temporal representation learning. The proposed MEET-Sepsis framework achieves competitive prediction accuracy using only 20% of the ICU monitoring time required by SOTA methods, significantly advancing early SP. Extensive validation confirms its efficacy. Code is available at: https://github.com/yueliangy/MEET-Sepsis.

Abstract: How do latent and inference time computations enable large language models (LLMs) to solve multi-step reasoning? We introduce a framework for tracing and steering algorithmic primitives that underlie model reasoning. Our approach links reasoning traces to internal activation patterns and evaluates algorithmic primitives by injecting them into residual streams and measuring their effect on reasoning steps and task performance. We consider four benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering neural activations and labeling their matched reasoning traces. We then apply function vector methods to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in Phi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning. Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens algorithmic generalization across domains.

<title>Can GRPO Help LLMs Transcend Their Pretraining Origin?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15990</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), primarily driven by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, is a leading approach for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its wide adoption, GRPO's gains are often inconsistent; for instance, a model may show significant improvement in one reasoning domain, like mathematics, yet remain stagnant in another, such as medicine. This inconsistency raises a critical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and generalize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data distribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a conservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and thus unable to discover completely novel solutions. We further validate this in carefully designed controlled studies by training transformers from scratch, evaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token representation, and compositionality. Our results provide a principled explanation for GRPO's boundaries: OOD improvement emerges only when the target task aligns with the model's pretrained biases, while gains on in-distribution (ID) tasks diminish as performance saturates. This reframes GRPO not as a universal reasoning enhancer but as a tool that sharpens pretraining biases. Our findings motivate future development of algorithms that can expand a model's capabilities beyond its pretraining origin.

<title>Stratos: An End-to-End Distillation Pipeline for Customized LLMs under Distributed Cloud Environments</title>

arXiv:2510.15992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing industrial demand for customized and cost-efficient large language models (LLMs) is fueled by the rise of vertical, domain-specific tasks and the need to optimize performance under constraints such as latency and budget. Knowledge distillation, as an efficient model compression and transfer technique, offers a feasible solution. However, existing distillation frameworks often require manual intervention and struggle to meet such complex user-defined distillation requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose Stratos, an end-to-end LLM distillation pipeline that automates server and model selection, knowledge distillation, and deployment in distributed cloud environments. Given user-defined constraints on model performance and system budget, Stratos automatically selects Pareto-optimal servers, dynamically matches teacher-student pairs, and adapts distillation strategies based on task complexity to optimize cloud hosting. Experiments show that Stratos produces a student model that achieves four times the accuracy of its GPT-4o teacher baseline on a rare, domain-specific Mahjong reasoning task with reverse synthetic data and knowledge injection. Moreover, it achieves reduced latency and cost without compromising accuracy. These results highlight its promise for vertical-domain LLM deployment.

<title>MCP Security Bench (MSB): Benchmarking Attacks Against Model Context Protocol in LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how large language model (LLM) agents discover, describe, and call external tools. While MCP unlocks broad interoperability, it also enlarges the attack surface by making tools first-class, composable objects with natural-language metadata, and standardized I/O. We present MSB (MCP Security Benchmark), the first end-to-end evaluation suite that systematically measures how well LLM agents resist MCP-specific attacks throughout the full tool-use pipeline: task planning, tool invocation, and response handling. MSB contributes: (1) a taxonomy of 12 attacks including name-collision, preference manipulation, prompt injections embedded in tool descriptions, out-of-scope parameter requests, user-impersonating responses, false-error escalation, tool-transfer, retrieval injection, and mixed attacks; (2) an evaluation harness that executes attacks by running real tools (both benign and malicious) via MCP rather than simulation; and (3) a robustness metric that quantifies the trade-off between security and performance: Net Resilient Performance (NRP). We evaluate nine popular LLM agents across 10 domains and 400+ tools, producing 2,000 attack instances. Results reveal the effectiveness of attacks against each stage of MCP. Models with stronger performance are more vulnerable to attacks due to their outstanding tool calling and instruction following capabilities. MSB provides a practical baseline for researchers and practitioners to study, compare, and harden MCP agents.

<title>Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov Distance for Measuring Distribution Shift in Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: One of the major problems in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the fact that the probability distribution of the test data in the real world could deviate substantially from the probability distribution of the training data set. When this happens, the predictions of an ML system or an AI agent could involve large errors which is very troublesome and undesirable. While this is a well-known hard problem plaguing the AI and ML systems' accuracy and reliability, in certain applications such errors could be critical for safety and reliability of AI and ML systems. One approach to deal with this problem is to monitor and measure the deviation in the probability distribution of the test data in real time and to compensate for this deviation. In this paper, we propose and explore the use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test for measuring the distribution shift and we show how the KS distance can be used to quantify the distribution shift and its impact on an AI agent's performance. Our results suggest that KS distance could be used as a valuable statistical tool for monitoring and measuring the distribution shift. More specifically, it is shown that even a distance of KS=0.02 could lead to about 50\% increase in the travel time at a single intersection using a Reinforcement Learning agent which is quite significant. It is hoped that the use of KS Test and KS distance in AI-based smart transportation could be an important step forward for gauging the performance degradation of an AI agent in real time and this, in turn, could help the AI agent to cope with the distribution shift in a more informed manner.

Abstract: Recent works have shown that natural gradient methods can significantly outperform standard optimizers when training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). In this paper, we analyze the training dynamics of PINNs optimized with ANaGRAM, a natural-gradient-inspired approach employing singular value decomposition with cutoff regularization. Building on this analysis, we propose a multi-cutoff adaptation strategy that further enhances ANaGRAM's performance. Experiments on benchmark PDEs validate the effectiveness of our method, which allows to reach machine precision on some experiments. To provide theoretical grounding, we develop a framework based on spectral theory that explains the necessity of regularization and extend previous shown connections with Green's functions theory.

arXiv:2510.16007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-centric learning emphasizes curating high-quality training samples to boost performance rather than designing new architectures. A central problem is to estimate the influence of training sample efficiently. Prior studies largely focus on static influence measured on a converged model, overlooking how data valuation dynamically changes during optimization. This omission neglects the dynamic nature of sample influence during optimization, especially in deep models. To address the computational burden of frequent influence estimation, we develop a layer-aware online estimator that requires only loss-to-output gradients. This design avoids parameter-level and full-network gradients while preserving ranking fidelity. Extensive experiments across LLM pretraining, fine-tuning, and image classification show our method improves accuracy with substantially lower time and memory cost, making dynamic data curation efficient and scalable in practice.

Abstract: Infrastructure in smart cities is increasingly monitored by networks of closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Roads, bridges and tunnels develop cracks, potholes, and fluid leaks that threaten public safety and require timely repair. Manual inspection is costly and hazardous, and existing automatic systems typically address individual defect types or provide unstructured outputs that cannot directly guide maintenance crews. This paper proposes a comprehensive pipeline that leverages street CCTV streams for multi defect detection and segmentation using the YOLO family of object detectors and passes the detections to a vision language model (VLM) for scene aware summarization. The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that includes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans, and urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection, highlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and LLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation on public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system accurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries. We conclude by discussing challenges and directions for scaling the system to city wide deployments.

Abstract: Billions of dollars are lost every year in DeFi platforms by transactions exploiting business logic or accounting vulnerabilities. Existing defenses focus on static code analysis, public mempool screening, attacker contract detection, or trusted off-chain monitors, none of which prevents exploits submitted through private relays or malicious contracts that execute within the same block. We present the first decentralized, fully on-chain learning framework that: (i) performs gas-prohibitive computation on Layer-2 to reduce cost, (ii) propagates verified model updates to Layer-1, and (iii) enables gas-bounded, low-latency inference inside smart contracts. A novel Proof-of-Improvement (PoIm) protocol governs the training process and verifies each decentralized micro update as a self-verifying training transaction. Updates are accepted by \textit{PoIm} only if they demonstrably improve at least one core metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, precision, or recall) on a public benchmark without degrading any of the other core metrics, while adversarial proposals get financially penalized through an adaptable test set for evolving threats. We develop quantization and loop-unrolling techniques that enable inference for logistic regression, SVM, MLPs, CNNs, and gated RNNs (with support for formally verified decision tree inference) within the Ethereum block gas limit, while remaining bit-exact to their off-chain counterparts, formally proven in Z3. We curate 298 unique real-world exploits (2020 - 2025) with 402 exploit transactions across eight EVM chains, collectively responsible for \$3.74 B in losses.

Abstract: Neural networks increasingly run on hardware outside the user's control (cloud GPUs, inference marketplaces). Yet ML-as-a-Service reveals little about what actually ran or whether returned outputs faithfully reflect the intended inputs. Users lack recourse against service downgrades (model swaps, quantization, graph rewrites, or discrepancies like altered ad embeddings). Verifying outputs is hard because floating-point(FP) execution on heterogeneous accelerators is inherently nondeterministic. Existing approaches are either impractical for real FP neural networks or reintroduce vendor trust. We present NAO: a Nondeterministic tolerance Aware Optimistic verification protocol that accepts outputs within principled operator-level acceptance regions rather than requiring bitwise equality. NAO combines two error models: (i) sound per-operator IEEE-754 worst-case bounds and (ii) tight empirical percentile profiles calibrated across hardware. Discrepancies trigger a Merkle-anchored, threshold-guided dispute game that recursively partitions the computation graph until one operator remains, where adjudication reduces to a lightweight theoretical-bound check or a small honest-majority vote against empirical thresholds. Unchallenged results finalize after a challenge window, without requiring trusted hardware or deterministic kernels. We implement NAO as a PyTorch-compatible runtime and a contract layer currently deployed on Ethereum Holesky testnet. The runtime instruments graphs, computes per-operator bounds, and runs unmodified vendor kernels in FP32 with negligible overhead (0.3% on Qwen3-8B). Across CNNs, Transformers and diffusion models on A100, H100, RTX6000, RTX4090, empirical thresholds are $10^2-10^3$ times tighter than theoretical bounds, and bound-aware adversarial attacks achieve 0% success. NAO reconciles scalability with verifiability for real-world heterogeneous ML compute.

Abstract: The escalating frequency and severity of disasters routinely overwhelm traditional response capabilities, exposing critical vulnerability in disaster management. Current practices are hindered by fragmented data streams, siloed technologies, resource constraints, and the erosion of institutional memory, which collectively impede timely and effective decision making. This study introduces Disaster Copilot, a vision for a multi-agent artificial intelligence system designed to overcome these systemic challenges by unifying specialized AI tools within a collaborative framework. The proposed architecture utilizes a central orchestrator to coordinate diverse sub-agents, each specializing in critical domains such as predictive risk analytics, situational awareness, and impact assessment. By integrating multi-modal data, the system delivers a holistic, real-time operational picture and serve as the essential AI backbone required to advance Disaster Digital Twins from passive models to active, intelligent environments. Furthermore, it ensures functionality in resource-limited environments through on-device orchestration and incorporates mechanisms to capture institutional knowledge, mitigating the impact of staff turnover. We detail the system architecture and propose a three-phased roadmap emphasizing the parallel growth of technology, organizational capacity, and human-AI teaming. Disaster Copilot offers a transformative vision, fostering collective human-machine intelligence to build more adaptive, data-driven and resilient communities.

Abstract: Social networks have become a crucial source of real-time information for individuals. The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered considerable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous detection technologies. However, the vulnerability and robustness of these detection methods is still underexplored. Existing Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited control over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the heterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the first adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot control attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors. Specifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts by reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby evading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving social bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social accounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then employed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the attachment strategy through reinforcement learning. Additionally, a hierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy is designed to accelerate the reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on social bot detection datasets demonstrate that our framework can effectively undermine the performance of GNN-based detectors.

Abstract: This study investigates the privacy risks associated with diffusion-based synthetic tabular data generation methods, focusing on their susceptibility to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). We examine two recent models, TabDDPM and TabSyn, by developing query-based MIAs based on the step-wise error comparison method. Our findings reveal that TabDDPM is more vulnerable to these attacks. TabSyn exhibits resilience against our attack models. Our work underscores the importance of evaluating the privacy implications of diffusion models and encourages further research into robust privacy-preserving mechanisms for synthetic data generation.

<title>Vector Quantization in the Brain: Grid-like Codes in World Models</title>

Abstract: We propose Grid-like Code Quantization (GCQ), a brain-inspired method for compressing observation-action sequences into discrete representations using grid-like patterns in attractor dynamics. Unlike conventional vector quantization approaches that operate on static inputs, GCQ performs spatiotemporal compression through an action-conditioned codebook, where codewords are derived from continuous attractor neural networks and dynamically selected based on actions. This enables GCQ to jointly compress space and time, serving as a unified world model. The resulting representation supports long-horizon prediction, goal-directed planning, and inverse modeling. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate GCQ's effectiveness in compact encoding and downstream performance. Our work offers both a computational tool for efficient sequence modeling and a theoretical perspective on the formation of grid-like codes in neural systems.

<title>Kelle: Co-design KV Caching and eDRAM for Efficient LLM Serving in Edge Computing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16040</link>

Abstract: Running Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is crucial for reducing latency, improving real-time processing, and enhancing privacy. By performing inference directly on the device, data does not need to be sent to the cloud, ensuring faster responses and reducing reliance on network connectivity. However, implementing LLMs on edge devices presents challenges, particularly with managing key-value (KV) caches, which plays a pivotal role in LLM serving. As the input text lengthens, the size of the KV cache increases linearly with the sequence length, leading to a significant memory footprint and data access costs. On the other hand, edge devices have limited memory and computational power, making it hard to store and efficiently access the large caches needed for LLM inference.
  To mitigate the substantial overhead caused by KV cache, we propose using embedded DRAM (eDRAM) as the primary storage for LLM serving in edge device, which offers higher storage density compared to SRAM. However, to ensure data integrity, eDRAM needs periodic refresh operations, which are power-intensive. To reduce eDRAM costs and improve overall system performance, we propose~\textit{Kelle}, a software-hardware co-design solution optimized for deploying LLMs on eDRAM-based edge systems. Combined with our fine-grained memory eviction, recomputation, and refresh control algorithms, the \textit{Kelle} accelerator delivers a $3.9\times$ speedup and $4.5\times$ energy savings compared to existing baseline solutions.

Abstract: This paper investigates the concept of Labour as an expression of `timenergy' - a fusion of time and energy - and its entanglement within the system of Capital. We define Labour as the commodified, quantifiable expansion of timenergy, in contrast to Capital, which is capable of accumulation and abstraction. We explore Labour's historical evolution, its coercive and alienating nature, and its transformation through automation and artificial intelligence. Using a game-theoretic, agent-based simulation, we model interactions between Capital and Labour in production processes governed by Cobb-Douglas functions. Our results show that despite theoretical symmetry, learning agents disproportionately gravitate toward capital-intensive processes, revealing Capital's superior organizational influence due to its accumulative capacity. We argue that Capital functions as an artificially alive system animated by the living Labour it consumes, and question whether life can sustain itself without the infrastructures of Capital in a future of increasing automation. This study offers both a critique of and a framework for understanding Labour's subjugation within the Capital system.

<title>AMS-QUANT: Adaptive Mantissa Sharing for Floating-point Quantization</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various kinds of tasks, while the billion or even trillion parameters bring storage and efficiency bottlenecks for inference. Quantization, particularly floating-point quantization, is known to be capable of speeding up LLM inference by reducing memory footprint and data movement during the inference process. For the first time, we advance the floating-point quantization exploration from integer bitwidths to non-integer bit-widths, namely AMS-Quant, to further approach the quantization sweet spot. AMS-Quant incorporates two novel techniques to put it into effect: (1) it proposes Mantissa-bit Sharing, which groups k quantized weights and lets them share the least significant mantissa bit, allowing us to further approach the minimum quantization bit-width without accuracy loss. (2) It introduces Adaptive Searching, which employs an offline optimization strategy to minimize the accuracy degradation introduced by sharing. Moreover, AMS-Quant is also prototyped as efficient CUDA Linear kernels, which translates memory savings into wall-clock latency reduction by reducing memory access. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets and models show that AMS-Quant can quantize the model to FP-5.33-e2m3 and FP4.25-e2m2, and significantly speed up the LLM decoding over FP16 inference (2.8x and 3.2x), with negligible accuracy loss.

<title>Open Shouldn't Mean Exempt: Open-Source Exceptionalism and Generative AI</title>

Abstract: Any argument that open-source generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is inherently ethical or legal solely because it is open source is flawed. Yet, this is the explicit or implicit stance of several open-source GenAI entities. This paper critically examines prevalent justifications for "open-source exceptionalism," demonstrating how contemporary open-source GenAI often inadvertently facilitates unlawful conduct and environmental degradation without genuinely disrupting established oligopolies. Furthermore, the paper exposes the unsubstantiated and strategic deployment of "democratization" and "innovation" rhetoric to advocate for regulatory exemptions not afforded to proprietary systems.
  The conclusion is that open-source developers must be held to the same legal and ethical standards as all other actors in the technological ecosystem. However, the paper proposes a narrowly tailored safe harbor designed to protect legitimate, non-commercial scientific research, contingent upon adherence to specific criteria. Ultimately, this paper advocates for a framework of responsible AI development, wherein openness is pursued within established ethical and legal boundaries, with due consideration for its broader societal implications.

<title>In the Mood to Exclude: Revitalizing Trespass to Chattels in the Era of GenAI Scraping</title>

Abstract: This paper argues that website owners have the right to exclude others from their websites. Accordingly, when generative AI (GenAI) scraping bots intentionally circumvent reasonable technological barriers, their conduct could be actionable as trespass to chattels. If the scraping leads to a decrease in the website's value, then trespass to chattels should apply. The prevailing judicial focus on website content and the dismissal of trespass claims absent proof of server impairment or user disruption misconstrues the nature of the website itself as a form of digital property, focusing too narrowly on what constitutes harm under a claim of trespass. By shifting analysis from content to the website itself as an integrated digital asset and illustrating the harm to the value of the chattel, this paper demonstrates that the right to exclude applies online with the same force as it does to tangible property.
  Courts and litigants have struggled to police large-scale scraping because copyright preemption narrows available claims, leaving copyright and its fair use defense as the primary battleground. In contrast, recognizing websites as personal property revives trespass to chattels as a meaningful cause of action, providing website owners with an enforceable exclusionary right. Such protection would disincentivize exploitative scraping, preserve incentives for content creation, aid in protecting privacy and personal data, and safeguard values of autonomy and expression. Ultimately, this paper contends that reaffirming website owners' right to exclude is essential to maintaining a fair and sustainable online environment.

Abstract: Autonomous agents capable of operating complex graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have the potential to transform desktop automation. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved UI understanding, navigating full-window, multi-application desktop environments remains a major challenge. Data availability is limited by costly manual annotation, closed-source datasets and surface-level synthetic pipelines. We introduce GUIrilla, an automated scalable framework that systematically explores applications via native accessibility APIs to address the critical data collection challenge in GUI automation. Our framework focuses on macOS - an ecosystem with limited representation in current UI datasets - though many of its components are designed for broader cross-platform applicability. GUIrilla organizes discovered interface elements and crawler actions into hierarchical GUI graphs and employs specialized interaction handlers to achieve comprehensive application coverage. Using the application graphs from GUIrilla crawler, we construct and release GUIrilla-Task, a large-scale dataset of 27,171 functionally grounded tasks across 1,108 macOS applications, each annotated with full-desktop and window-level screenshots, accessibility metadata, and semantic action traces. Empirical results show that tuning LLM-based agents on GUIrilla-Task significantly improves performance on downstream UI tasks, outperforming synthetic baselines on the ScreenSpot Pro benchmark while using 97% less data. We also release macapptree, an open-source library for reproducible collection of structured accessibility metadata, along with the full GUIrilla-Task dataset, the manually verified GUIrilla-Gold benchmark, and the framework code to support open research in desktop autonomy.

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting is a core technology for building Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling better urban resource allocation and improved travel experiences. With growing urbanization, traffic congestion has intensified, highlighting the need for reliable and responsive forecasting models. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), has emerged as the mainstream paradigm in traffic forecasting. GNNs can effectively capture complex spatial dependencies in road network topology and dynamic temporal evolution patterns in traffic flow data. Foundational models such as STGCN and GraphWaveNet, along with more recent developments including STWave and D2STGNN, have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic datasets. These approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by periodic regularities. To address this challenge, researchers have explored various ways to incorporate event information. Early attempts primarily relied on manually engineered event features. For instance, some approaches introduced manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for different event-induced traffic conditions. While these methods somewhat enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often lead to the loss of rich semantic details.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence surrogates are systems designed to infer preferences when individuals lose decision-making capacity. Fairness in such systems is a domain that has been insufficiently explored. Traditional algorithmic fairness frameworks are insufficient for contexts where decisions are relational, existential, and culturally diverse. This paper explores an ethical framework for algorithmic fairness in AI surrogates by mapping major fairness notions onto potential real-world end-of-life scenarios. It then examines fairness across moral traditions. The authors argue that fairness in this domain extends beyond parity of outcomes to encompass moral representation, fidelity to the patient's values, relationships, and worldview.

Abstract: This study presents a novel multi-model fusion framework leveraging two state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT and Claude, to enhance the reliability of chest X-ray interpretation on the CheXpert dataset. From the full CheXpert corpus of 224,316 chest radiographs, we randomly selected 234 radiologist-annotated studies to evaluate unimodal performance using image-only prompts. In this setting, ChatGPT and Claude achieved diagnostic accuracies of 62.8% and 76.9%, respectively. A similarity-based consensus approach, using a 95% output similarity threshold, improved accuracy to 77.6%. To assess the impact of multimodal inputs, we then generated synthetic clinical notes following the MIMIC-CXR template and evaluated a separate subset of 50 randomly selected cases paired with both images and synthetic text. On this multimodal cohort, performance improved to 84% for ChatGPT and 76% for Claude, while consensus accuracy reached 91.3%. Across both experimental conditions, agreement-based fusion consistently outperformed individual models. These findings highlight the utility of integrating complementary modalities and using output-level consensus to improve the trustworthiness and clinical utility of AI-assisted radiological diagnosis, offering a practical path to reduce diagnostic errors with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: The recent development of foundation models for time series data has generated considerable interest in using such models across a variety of applications. Although foundation models achieve state-of-the-art predictive performance, their calibration properties remain relatively underexplored, despite the fact that calibration can be critical for many practical applications. In this paper, we investigate the calibration-related properties of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines. We perform a series of systematic evaluations assessing model calibration (i.e., over- or under-confidence), effects of varying prediction heads, and calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting. We find that time series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, in contrast to the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.

Abstract: Self-correction of large language models (LLMs) emerges as a critical component for enhancing their reasoning performance. Although various self-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly correct themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this study, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the effectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and fine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction methods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing different self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it reduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited optimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs. Interestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline demonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the potential of self-correction to enhance LLM's reasoning performance while highlighting the ongoing challenge of improving their efficiency. Consequently, we advocate for further research focused on optimizing the balance between reasoning capabilities and operational efficiency. Project Page: https://correctbench.github.io/

Abstract: Accurate voltage estimation in distribution networks is critical for real-time monitoring and increasing the reliability of the grid. As DER penetration and distribution level voltage variability increase, robust distribution system state estimation (DSSE) has become more essential to maintain safe and efficient operations. Traditional DSSE techniques, however, struggle with sparse measurements and the scale of modern feeders, limiting their scalability to large networks. This paper presents a hierarchical graph neural network for substation-level voltage estimation that exploits both electrical topology and physical features, while remaining robust to the low observability levels common to real-world distribution networks. Leveraging the public SMART-DS datasets, the model is trained and evaluated on thousands of buses across multiple substations and DER penetration scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 2 times lower RMSE than alternative data-driven models, and maintains high accuracy with as little as 1\% measurement coverage. The results highlight the potential of GNNs to enable scalable, reproducible, and data-driven voltage monitoring for distribution systems.

Abstract: Solving the nonlinear AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem remains a major computational bottleneck for real-time grid operations. In this paper, we propose a residual learning paradigm that uses fast DC optimal power flow (DC OPF) solutions as a baseline, and learns only the nonlinear corrections required to provide the full AC-OPF solution. The method utilizes a topology-aware Graph Neural Network with local attention and two-level DC feature integration, trained using a physics-informed loss that enforces AC power-flow feasibility and operational limits. Evaluations on OPFData for 57-, 118-, and 2000-bus systems show around 25% lower MSE, up to 3X reduction in feasibility error, and up to 13X runtime speedup compared to conventional AC OPF solvers. The model maintains accuracy under N-1 contingencies and scales efficiently to large networks. These results demonstrate that residual learning is a practical and scalable bridge between linear approximations and AC-feasible OPF, enabling near real-time operational decision making.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a critical research frontier addressing data heterogeneity issue across distributed clients. Novel model architectures and collaboration mechanisms are engineered to accommodate statistical disparities while producing client-specific models. Parameter decoupling represents a promising paradigm for maintaining model performance in PFL frameworks. However, the communication efficiency of many existing methods remains suboptimal, sustaining substantial communication burdens that impede practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose Federated Learning with Programmed Update and Reduced INformation (FedPURIN), a novel framework that strategically identifies critical parameters for transmission through an integer programming formulation. This mathematically grounded strategy is seamlessly integrated into a sparse aggregation scheme, achieving a significant communication reduction while preserving the efficacy. Comprehensive evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks under varied non-IID conditions demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods, coupled with quantifiable communication reduction through sparse aggregation. The framework establishes a new paradigm for communication-efficient PFL, particularly advantageous for edge intelligence systems operating with heterogeneous data sources.

Abstract: Despite accounting for 96.1% of all businesses in Malaysia, access to financing remains one of the most persistent challenges faced by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Newly established or young businesses are often excluded from formal credit markets as traditional underwriting approaches rely heavily on credit bureau data. This study investigates the potential of bank statement data as an alternative data source for credit assessment to promote financial inclusion in emerging markets. Firstly, we propose a cash flow-based underwriting pipeline where we utilise bank statement data for end to end data extraction and machine learning credit scoring. Secondly, we introduce a novel dataset of 611 loan applicants from a Malaysian lending institution. Thirdly, we develop and evaluate credit scoring models based on application information and bank transaction-derived features. Empirical results show that the use of such data boosts the performance of all models on our dataset, which can improve credit scoring for new-to-lending MSMEs. Lastly, we intend to release the anonymised bank transaction dataset to facilitate further research on MSMEs financial inclusion within Malaysia's emerging economy.

Abstract: Creating interdisciplinary design projects is time-consuming and cognitively demanding for teachers, requiring curriculum alignment, cross-subject integration, and careful sequencing. International research reports increasing teacher use of AI alongside persistent workload pressures, underscoring the need for planning support. This paper presents the Interdisciplinary Design Project Planner (IDPplanner), a GPT-based planning assistant grounded in Design Innovation principles, alignment with Singapore secondary school syllabuses, and 21st-century competencies. In a within-subject, counterbalanced workshop with 33 in-service teachers, participants produced two versions of the same project: manual and AI-assisted, followed by self- and peer-evaluations using a six-dimensional rubric. The AI-assisted version received higher scores for Curriculum Alignment, Design Thinking Application, and Coherence and Flow, with a marginal advantage for Assessment Strategies. Teacher reflections indicated that AI-assisted planning improved structure, sequencing, and idea generation, while contextualization to local syllabuses, class profiles, and student needs remained teacher-led. Contributions include a purpose-built planning tool that organizes ideas into a ten-component flow with ready-to-adapt prompts, templates, and assessment suggestions; an empirical, rubric-based comparison of planning quality; and evidence that AI can function as a pedagogical planning partner. Recommendations emphasize hybrid teacher-AI workflows to enhance curriculum alignment and reduce planning complexity, and design suggestions for developers to strengthen contextual customization, iterative design support, and localized rubrics. Although instantiated with a Singapore-based curriculum, the planning flow and rubric are framework-agnostic and can be parameterized for other systems.

Abstract: As design thinking education grows in secondary and tertiary contexts, educators face the challenge of evaluating creative artefacts that combine visual and textual elements. Traditional rubric-based assessment is laborious, time-consuming, and inconsistent due to reliance on Teaching Assistants (TA) in large, multi-section cohorts. This paper presents an exploratory study investigating the reliability and perceived accuracy of AI-assisted assessment compared to TA-assisted assessment in evaluating student posters in design thinking education. Two activities were conducted with 33 Ministry of Education (MOE) Singapore school teachers to (1) compare AI-generated scores with TA grading across three key dimensions: empathy and user understanding, identification of pain points and opportunities, and visual communication, and (2) examine teacher preferences for AI-assigned, TA-assigned, and hybrid scores. Results showed low statistical agreement between instructor and AI scores for empathy and pain points, with slightly higher alignment for visual communication. Teachers preferred TA-assigned scores in six of ten samples. Qualitative feedback highlighted the potential of AI for formative feedback, consistency, and student self-reflection, but raised concerns about its limitations in capturing contextual nuance and creative insight. The study underscores the need for hybrid assessment models that integrate computational efficiency with human insights. This research contributes to the evolving conversation on responsible AI adoption in creative disciplines, emphasizing the balance between automation and human judgment for scalable and pedagogically sound assessment.

Four novice and four non-novice readers (radiologists and medical students) each analyzed 35 bedside chest radiographs per session using a customized viewer and an eye-tracking system. Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy (compared with expert consensus using Cohen's $\kappa$), reporting time per radiograph, eye-tracking metrics, and questionnaire-based user experience. Statistical analysis used generalized linear mixed models with Bonferroni post-hoc tests with a significance level of ($P \le .01$). Diagnostic accuracy was similar in FT ($\kappa = 0.58$) and SR ($\kappa = 0.60$) but higher in AI-SR ($\kappa = 0.71$, $P < .001$). Reporting times decreased from $88 \pm 38$ s (FT) to $37 \pm 18$ s (SR) and $25 \pm 9$ s (AI-SR) ($P < .001$). Saccade counts for the radiograph field ($205 \pm 135$ (FT), $123 \pm 88$ (SR), $97 \pm 58$ (AI-SR)) and total fixation duration for the report field ($11 \pm 5$ s (FT), $5 \pm 3$ s (SR), $4 \pm 1$ s (AI-SR)) were lower with SR and AI-SR ($P < .001$ each). Novice readers shifted gaze towards the radiograph in SR, while non-novice readers maintained their focus on the radiograph. AI-SR was the preferred mode. In conclusion, SR improves efficiency by guiding visual attention toward the image, and AI-prefilled SR further enhances diagnostic accuracy and user satisfaction.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful data-driven paradigm for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering orders-of-magnitude acceleration over traditional solvers. However, existing approaches still suffer from limited accuracy and scalability, particularly on irregular domains where fluid flows exhibit rich multiscale structures. In this work, we introduce the Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO), a new architecture for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on three-dimensional (3D) unstructured point clouds. MNO explicitly decomposes information across three scales: a global dimension-shrinkage attention module for long-range dependencies, a local graph attention module for neighborhood-level interactions, and a micro point-wise attention module for fine-grained details. This design preserves multiscale inductive biases while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate MNO on four diverse benchmarks, covering both steady-state and unsteady flow scenarios with up to 300K points. Across all tasks, MNO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems. Our results highlight the importance of explicit multiscale design for neural operators and establish MNO as a scalable framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on irregular domains.

<title>Data-Driven Analysis of Intersectional Bias in Image Classification: A Framework with Bias-Weighted Augmentation</title>

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on imbalanced datasets often exhibit intersectional biases-systematic errors arising from the interaction of multiple attributes such as object class and environmental conditions. This paper presents a data-driven framework for analyzing and mitigating such biases in image classification. We introduce the Intersectional Fairness Evaluation Framework (IFEF), which combines quantitative fairness metrics with interpretability tools to systematically identify bias patterns in model predictions. Building on this analysis, we propose Bias-Weighted Augmentation (BWA), a novel data augmentation strategy that adapts transformation intensities based on subgroup distribution statistics. Experiments on the Open Images V7 dataset with five object classes demonstrate that BWA improves accuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24 percentage points while reducing fairness metric disparities by 35%. Statistical analysis across multiple independent runs confirms the significance of improvements (p < 0.05). Our methodology provides a replicable approach for analyzing and addressing intersectional biases in image classification systems.

<title>Early-stopping for Transformer model training</title>

Abstract: This work introduces a novel theoretical framework grounded in Random Matrix Theory (RMT) for analyzing Transformer training dynamics. We focus on the underlying mechanisms that drive performance improvements and derive principled early-stopping criteria. Empirically, we observe that the spectral density of the shallow self-attention matrix V consistently evolves into a heavy-tailed distribution. Utilizing the PL (Power Law) fit to this matrix as a probe, we demarcate training into three stages: structural exploration, heavy-tailed structure stabilization, and convergence saturation. This staging provides guidance for preliminary stopping decisions. Crucially, we propose two consistent and validation-free criteria: a quantitative metric for heavy-tailed dynamics and a novel spectral signature indicative of convergence. The strong alignment between these criteria highlights the utility of RMT for monitoring and diagnosing the progression of Transformer model training.

<title>Optimization of the quantization of dense neural networks from an exact QUBO formulation</title>

arXiv:2510.16075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a post-training quantization (PTQ) method for dense neural networks via a novel ADAROUND-based QUBO formulation. Using the Frobenius distance between the theoretical output and the dequantized output (before the activation function) as the objective, an explicit QUBO whose binary variables represent the rounding choice for each weight and bias is obtained. Additionally, by exploiting the structure of the coefficient QUBO matrix, the global problem can be exactly decomposed into $n$ independent subproblems of size $f+1$, which can be efficiently solved using some heuristics such as simulated annealing. The approach is evaluated on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10 across integer precisions from int8 to int1 and compared with a round-to-nearest traditional quantization methodology.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.16076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems suffer from biases that cause the collected feedback to incompletely reveal user preference. While debiasing learning has been extensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called counterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items, significantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test environment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test environment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual test emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test focuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is desirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only one. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive Preference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences with dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed to drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments. Employing a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased model, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected feedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through self-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its knowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce more accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations, thereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and counterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via: https://github.com/SeongKu-Kang/BPL.

<title>Continual Knowledge Consolidation LORA for Domain Incremental Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16077</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.16077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is a continual learning sub-branch that aims to address never-ending arrivals of new domains without catastrophic forgetting problems. Despite the advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches, existing works create task-specific LoRAs overlooking shared knowledge across tasks. Inaccurate selection of task-specific LORAs during inference results in significant drops in accuracy, while existing works rely on linear or prototype-based classifiers, which have suboptimal generalization powers. Our paper proposes continual knowledge consolidation low rank adaptation (CONEC-LoRA) addressing the DIL problems. CONEC-LoRA is developed from consolidations between task-shared LORA to extract common knowledge and task-specific LORA to embrace domain-specific knowledge. Unlike existing approaches, CONEC-LoRA integrates the concept of a stochastic classifier whose parameters are sampled from a distribution, thus enhancing the likelihood of correct classifications. Last but not least, an auxiliary network is deployed to optimally predict the task-specific LoRAs for inferences and implements the concept of a different-depth network structure in which every layer is connected with a local classifier to take advantage of intermediate representations. This module integrates the ball-generator loss and transformation module to address the synthetic sample bias problem. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of CONEC-LoRA over prior arts in 4 popular benchmark problems with over 5% margins.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.16078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a practical match-on-card design for face verification in which compact 64/128-bit templates are produced off-card by PCA-ITQ and compared on-card via constant-time Hamming distance. We specify ISO/IEC 7816-4 and 14443-4 command APDUs with fixed-length payloads and decision-only status words (no score leakage), together with a minimal per-identity EEPROM map. Using real binary codes from a CelebA working set (55 identities, 412 images), we (i) derive operating thresholds from ROC/DET, (ii) replay enroll->verify transactions at those thresholds, and (iii) bound end-to-end time by pure link latency plus a small constant on-card budget. Even at the slowest contact rate (9.6 kbps), total verification time is 43.9 ms (64 b) and 52.3 ms (128 b); at 38.4 kbps both are <14 ms. At FAR = 1%, both code lengths reach TPR = 0.836, while 128 b lowers EER relative to 64 b. An optional +6 B helper (targeted symbol-level parity over empirically unstable bits) is latency-negligible. Overall, short binary templates, fixed-payload decision-only APDUs, and constant-time matching satisfy ISO/IEC transport constraints with wide timing margin and align with ISO/IEC 24745 privacy goals. Limitations: single-dataset evaluation and design-level (pre-hardware) timing; we outline AgeDB/CFP-FP and on-card microbenchmarks as next steps.

Abstract: Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents show strong performance in tool use, but lack the crucial capability to systematically learn from their own experiences. While existing frameworks mainly focus on mitigating external knowledge gaps, they fail to address a more fundamental limitation: the inability to iteratively refine problem-solving strategies. In this work, we introduce EvolveR, a framework designed to enable agent to self-improve through a complete, closed-loop experience lifecycle. This lifecycle comprises two key stages: (1) Offline Self-Distillation, where the agent's interaction trajectories are synthesized into a structured repository of abstract, reusable strategic principles; (2) Online Interaction, where the agent interacts with tasks and actively retrieves distilled principles to guide its decision-making, accumulating a diverse set of behavioral trajectories. This loop employs a policy reinforcement mechanism to iteratively update the agent based on its performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvolveR on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, where it achieves superior performance over strong agentic baselines. Our work presents a comprehensive blueprint for agents that learn not only from external data but also from the consequences of their own actions, paving the way for more autonomous and continuously improving systems.

Abstract: Emergency departments worldwide face rising patient volumes, workforce shortages, and variability in triage decisions that threaten the delivery of timely and accurate care. Current triage methods rely primarily on vital signs, routine laboratory values, and clinicians' judgment, which, while effective, often miss emerging biological signals that could improve risk prediction for infection typing or antibiotic administration in acute conditions. To address this challenge, we introduce TriAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that couples automated biomarker discovery with deep research for literature-grounded validation and novelty assessment. TriAgent employs a supervisor research agent to generate research topics and delegate targeted queries to specialized sub-agents for evidence retrieval from various data sources. Findings are synthesized to classify biomarkers as either grounded in existing knowledge or flagged as novel candidates, offering transparent justification and highlighting unexplored pathways in acute care risk stratification. Unlike prior frameworks limited to existing routine clinical biomarkers, TriAgent aims to deliver an end-to-end framework from data analysis to literature grounding to improve transparency, explainability and expand the frontier of potentially actionable clinical biomarkers. Given a user's clinical query and quantitative triage data, TriAgent achieved a topic adherence F1 score of 55.7 +/- 5.0%, surpassing the CoT-ReAct agent by over 10%, and a faithfulness score of 0.42 +/- 0.39, exceeding all baselines by more than 50%. Across experiments, TriAgent consistently outperformed state-of-the-art LLM-based agentic frameworks in biomarker justification and literature-grounded novelty assessment.

Abstract: While Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows promise in healthcare applications, existing conversational systems often falter in complex and sensitive medical domains such as Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH). These systems frequently struggle with hallucination and lack the specialized knowledge required, particularly for sensitive SRH topics. Furthermore, current AI approaches in healthcare tend to prioritize diagnostic capabilities over comprehensive patient care and education. Addressing these gaps, this work at the UNC School of Nursing introduces SARHAchat, a proof-of-concept Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbot. SARHAchat is designed as a reliable, user-centered system integrating medical expertise with empathetic communication to enhance SRH care delivery. Our evaluation demonstrates SARHAchat's ability to provide accurate and contextually appropriate contraceptive counseling while maintaining a natural conversational flow.

Abstract: We propose CITE V.1, an agentic, evidence-grounded framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide transparent and reproducible interpretations of RNA-seq clusters. Unlike existing enrichment-based approaches that reduce results to broad statistical associations and LLM-only models that risk unsupported claims or fabricated citations, CITE V.1 transforms cluster interpretation by producing biologically coherent explanations explicitly anchored in the biomedical literature. The framework orchestrates three specialized agents: a Retriever that gathers domain knowledge from PubMed and UniProt, an Interpreter that formulates functional hypotheses, and Critics that evaluate claims, enforce evidence grounding, and qualify uncertainty through confidence and reliability indicators. Applied to Salmonella enterica RNA-seq data, CITE V.1 generated biologically meaningful insights supported by the literature, while an LLM-only Gemini baseline frequently produced speculative results with false citations. By moving RNA-seq analysis from surface-level enrichment to auditable, interpretable, and evidence-based hypothesis generation, CITE V.1 advances the transparency and reliability of AI in biomedicine.

<title>PassREfinder-FL: Privacy-Preserving Credential Stuffing Risk Prediction via Graph-Based Federated Learning for Representing Password Reuse between Websites</title>

Abstract: Credential stuffing attacks have caused significant harm to online users who frequently reuse passwords across multiple websites. While prior research has attempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login attempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password creation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing mechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we propose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing risks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations -- defined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and represent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), we perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between sites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by incorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as nodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a federated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user sensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset of 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that PassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further validate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over other state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study. Finally, we demonstrate that the predicted results can be used to quantify password reuse likelihood as actionable risk scores.

Abstract: The 2022 World Mental Health Report calls for global mental health care reform, amid rising prevalence of issues like anxiety and depression that affect nearly one billion people worldwide. Traditional in-person therapy fails to meet this demand, and the situation is worsened by stigma. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) offer efficiency for AI-driven mental health solutions, they underperform because they lack specialized fine-tuning. Existing LLM-based mental health chatbots can engage in empathetic conversations, but they overlook real-time user mental state assessment which is critical for professional counseling. This paper proposes MoPHES, a framework that integrates mental state evaluation, conversational support, and professional treatment recommendations. The agent developed under this framework uses two fine-tuned MiniCPM4-0.5B LLMs: one is fine-tuned on mental health conditions datasets to assess users' mental states and predict the severity of anxiety and depression; the other is fine-tuned on multi-turn dialogues to handle conversations with users. By leveraging insights into users' mental states, our agent provides more tailored support and professional treatment recommendations. Both models are also deployed directly on mobile devices to enhance user convenience and protect user privacy. Additionally, to evaluate the performance of MoPHES with other LLMs, we develop a benchmark for the automatic evaluation of mental state prediction and multi-turn counseling dialogues, which includes comprehensive evaluation metrics, datasets, and methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly require mechanisms for continual adaptation without full retraining. However, sequential updates can lead to catastrophic forgetting, where new edits degrade previously acquired knowledge. This work presents STABLE, a gated continual self editing framework that constrains forgetting during sequential updates using parameter efficient fine tuning via Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA; see arXiv:2106.09685). Each candidate edit is evaluated against a stability budget using one of three metrics: (i) Exact Match (EM) drop, capturing factual accuracy loss; (ii) bits increase, reflecting reduced model confidence; and (iii) KL divergence, quantifying distributional drift between the base and adapted models. If a threshold is exceeded, the LoRA update is rescaled through a clipping procedure or rejected. Experiments on the Qwen-2.5-7B model show that gating effectively mitigates forgetting while preserving adaptability. EM based gating achieved the highest cumulative performance in short continual learning sequences. Our results show that different gating strategies can achieve comparable distribution shift (measured by KL divergence) while producing different accuracy outcomes, highlighting the importance of gating design in continual adaptation. This approach offers a principled method for continual model editing, enabling LLMs to integrate new knowledge while maintaining reliability. Code: https://github.com/Bhoy1/STABLE

Abstract: This study quantifies how prompting strategies interact with large language models (LLMs) to automate the screening stage of systematic literature reviews (SLRs). We evaluate six LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat-V3, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Llama-4-Maverick) under five prompt types (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), CoT-few-shot, self-reflection) across relevance classification and six Level-2 tasks, using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1. Results show pronounced model-prompt interaction effects: CoT-few-shot yields the most reliable precision-recall balance; zero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes; and self-reflection underperforms due to over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and DeepSeek provide robust overall performance, while GPT-4o-mini performs competitively at a substantially lower dollar cost. A cost-performance analysis for relevance classification (per 1,000 abstracts) reveals large absolute differences among model-prompt pairings; GPT-4o-mini remains low-cost across prompts, and structured prompts (CoT/CoT-few-shot) on GPT-4o-mini offer attractive F1 at a small incremental cost. We recommend a staged workflow that (1) deploys low-cost models with structured prompts for first-pass screening and (2) escalates only borderline cases to higher-capacity models. These findings highlight LLMs' uneven but promising potential to automate literature screening. By systematically analyzing prompt-model interactions, we provide a comparative benchmark and practical guidance for task-adaptive LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to learn different tasks without explicit finetuning when given many input-output examples / demonstrations through In-Context Learning (ICL). Increasing the number of examples, called ``shots'', improves downstream task performance but incurs higher memory and computational costs. In this work, we study an approach to improve the memory and computational efficiency of ICL inference by compressing the many-shot prompts. Given many shots comprising t tokens, our goal is to generate a m soft-token summary, where m < t. We first show that existing prompt compression methods are ineffective for many-shot compression, and simply using fewer shots as a baseline is surprisingly strong. To achieve effective compression, we find that: (a) a stronger compressor model with more trainable parameters is necessary, and (b) compressing many-shot representations at each transformer layer enables more fine-grained compression by providing each layer with its own compressed representation. Based on these insights, we propose MemCom, a layer-wise compression method. We systematically evaluate various compressor models and training approaches across different model sizes (2B and 7B), architectures (Gemma and Mistral), many-shot sequence lengths (3k-6k tokens), and compression ratios (3x to 8x). MemCom outperforms strong baselines across all compression ratios on multiple classification tasks with large label sets. Notably, while baseline performance degrades sharply at higher compression ratios, often by over 20-30%, MemCom maintains high accuracy with minimal degradation, typically dropping by less than 10%.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, in classification tasks, it is possible to design decision support systems that do not require human experts to understand when to cede agency to a classifier or when to exercise their own agency to achieve complementarity$\unicode{x2014}$experts using these systems make more accurate predictions than those made by the experts or the classifier alone. The key principle underpinning these systems reduces to adaptively controlling the level of human agency, by design. Can we use the same principle to achieve complementarity in sequential decision making tasks? In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively. We develop a decision support system that uses a pre-trained AI agent to narrow down the set of actions a human can take to a subset, and then asks the human to take an action from this action set. Along the way, we also introduce a bandit algorithm that leverages the smoothness properties of the action sets provided by our system to efficiently optimize the level of human agency. To evaluate our decision support system, we conduct a large-scale human subject study ($n = 1{,}600$) where participants play a wildfire mitigation game. We find that participants who play the game supported by our system outperform those who play on their own by $\sim$$30$% and the AI agent used by our system by $>$$2$%, even though the AI agent largely outperforms participants playing without support. We have made available the data gathered in our human subject study as well as an open source implementation of our system at https://github.com/Networks-Learning/narrowing-action-choices .

Abstract: The Aria Gen 2 Pilot Dataset (A2PD) is an egocentric multimodal open dataset captured using the state-of-the-art Aria Gen 2 glasses. To facilitate timely access, A2PD is released incrementally with ongoing dataset enhancements. The initial release features Dia'ane, our primary subject, who records her daily activities alongside friends, each equipped with Aria Gen 2 glasses. It encompasses five primary scenarios: cleaning, cooking, eating, playing, and outdoor walking. In each of the scenarios, we provide comprehensive raw sensor data and output data from various machine perception algorithms. These data illustrate the device's ability to perceive the wearer, the surrounding environment, and interactions between the wearer and the environment, while maintaining robust performance across diverse users and conditions. The A2PD is publicly available at projectaria.com, with open-source tools and usage examples provided in Project Aria Tools.

Abstract: Transferring appearance to 3D assets using different representations of the appearance object - such as images or text - has garnered interest due to its wide range of applications in industries like gaming, augmented reality, and digital content creation. However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the geometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A straightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we show that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we propose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a pretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free method interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance. This guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we experiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for appearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach successfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset, outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show that traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their inability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in absence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with a GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like assessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios, our method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion models and guidance functions.

<title>Agentic AI for Ultra-Modern Networks: Multi-Agent Framework for RAN Autonomy and Assurance</title>

Abstract: The increasing complexity of Beyond 5G and 6G networks necessitates new paradigms for autonomy and assur- ance. Traditional O-RAN control loops rely heavily on RIC- based orchestration, which centralizes intelligence and exposes the system to risks such as policy conflicts, data drift, and unsafe actions under unforeseen conditions. In this work, we argue that the future of autonomous networks lies in a multi-agentic architecture, where specialized agents collaborate to perform data collection, model training, prediction, policy generation, verification, deployment, and assurance. By replacing tightly- coupled centralized RIC-based workflows with distributed agents, the framework achieves autonomy, resilience, explainability, and system-wide safety. To substantiate this vision, we design and evaluate a traffic steering use case under surge and drift conditions. Results across four KPIs: RRC connected users, IP throughput, PRB utilization, and SINR, demonstrate that a naive predictor-driven deployment improves local KPIs but destabilizes neighbors, whereas the agentic system blocks unsafe policies, preserving global network health. This study highlights multi- agent architectures as a credible foundation for trustworthy AI- driven autonomy in next-generation RANs.

Abstract: Scientific literature is increasingly siloed by complex language, static disciplinary structures, and potentially sparse keyword systems, making it cumbersome to capture the dynamic nature of modern science. This study addresses these challenges by introducing an adaptable large language model (LLM)-driven framework to quantify thematic trends and map the evolving landscape of scientific knowledge. The approach is demonstrated over a 20-year collection of more than 1,500 engineering articles published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), marked for their breadth and depth of research focus. A two-stage classification pipeline first establishes a primary thematic category for each article based on its abstract. The subsequent phase performs a full-text analysis to assign secondary classifications, revealing latent, cross-topic connections across the corpus. Traditional natural language processing (NLP) methods, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), confirm the resulting topical structure and also suggest that standalone word-frequency analyses may be insufficient for mapping fields with high diversity. Finally, a disjoint graph representation between the primary and secondary classifications reveals implicit connections between themes that may be less apparent when analyzing abstracts or keywords alone. The findings show that the approach independently recovers much of the journal's editorially embedded structure without prior knowledge of its existing dual-classification schema (e.g., biological studies also classified as engineering). This framework offers a powerful tool for detecting potential thematic trends and providing a high-level overview of scientific progress.

Abstract: Effective human-AI collaboration on complex reasoning tasks requires that users understand and interact with the model's process, not just receive an output. However, the monolithic text from methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prevents this, as current interfaces lack real-time verbalization and robust user barge-in. We present AsyncVoice Agent, a system whose asynchronous architecture decouples a streaming LLM backend from a conversational voice frontend. This design allows narration and inference to run in parallel, empowering users to interrupt, query, and steer the model's reasoning process at any time. Objective benchmarks show this approach reduces interaction latency by more than 600x compared to monolithic baselines while ensuring high fidelity and competitive task accuracy. By enabling a two-way dialogue with a model's thought process, AsyncVoice Agent offers a new paradigm for building more effective, steerable, and trustworthy human-AI systems for high-stakes tasks.

<title>Bridging Symmetry and Robustness: On the Role of Equivariance in Enhancing Adversarial Robustness</title>

Abstract: Adversarial examples reveal critical vulnerabilities in deep neural networks by exploiting their sensitivity to imperceptible input perturbations. While adversarial training remains the predominant defense strategy, it often incurs significant computational cost and may compromise clean-data accuracy. In this work, we investigate an architectural approach to adversarial robustness by embedding group-equivariant convolutions-specifically, rotation- and scale-equivariant layers-into standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These layers encode symmetry priors that align model behavior with structured transformations in the input space, promoting smoother decision boundaries and greater resilience to adversarial attacks. We propose and evaluate two symmetry-aware architectures: a parallel design that processes standard and equivariant features independently before fusion, and a cascaded design that applies equivariant operations sequentially. Theoretically, we demonstrate that such models reduce hypothesis space complexity, regularize gradients, and yield tighter certified robustness bounds under the CLEVER (Cross Lipschitz Extreme Value for nEtwork Robustness) framework. Empirically, our models consistently improve adversarial robustness and generalization across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CIFAR-10C under both FGSM and PGD attacks, without requiring adversarial training. These findings underscore the potential of symmetry-enforcing architectures as efficient and principled alternatives to data augmentation-based defenses.

Abstract: The last decade has seen an upswing in interest and adoption of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, in large part due to its demonstrated capabilities at performing certain tasks at "super-human levels". This has incentivized the community to prioritize research that demonstrates RL agent performance, often at the expense of research aimed at understanding their learning dynamics. Performance-focused research runs the risk of overfitting on academic benchmarks -- thereby rendering them less useful -- which can make it difficult to transfer proposed techniques to novel problems. Further, it implicitly diminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at improving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points: (i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent capabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of reinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our benchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms. We use the popular Arcade Learning Environment (ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013) as an example of a benchmark that, despite being increasingly considered "saturated", can be effectively used for developing this understanding, and facilitating the deployment of RL techniques in impactful real-world problems.

<title>Expressive Reward Synthesis with the Runtime Monitoring Language</title>

Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is reward (mis)specification, whereby imprecisely defined reward functions can result in unintended, possibly harmful, behaviours. Indeed, reward functions in RL are typically treated as black-box mappings from state-action pairs to scalar values. While effective in many settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are given, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address this issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling the specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions. However, their expressivity is typically bounded by regular languages, leaving them unable to capture more complex behaviours such as counting or parametrised conditions. In this work, we build on the Runtime Monitoring Language (RML) to develop a novel class of language-based Reward Machines. By leveraging the built-in memory of RML, our approach can specify reward functions for non-regular, non-Markovian tasks. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our approach through experiments, highlighting additional advantages in flexible event-handling and task specification over existing Reward Machine-based methods.

Abstract: Real-world multi-agent systems may require ad hoc teaming, where an agent must coordinate with other previously unseen teammates to solve a task in a zero-shot manner. Prior work often either selects a pretrained policy based on an inferred model of the new teammates or pretrains a single policy that is robust to potential teammates. Instead, we propose to leverage all pretrained policies in a zero-shot transfer setting. We formalize this problem as an ad hoc multi-agent Markov decision process and present a solution that uses two key ideas, generalized policy improvement and difference rewards, for efficient and effective knowledge transfer between different teams. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm, Generalized Policy improvement for Ad hoc Teaming (GPAT), successfully enables zero-shot transfer to new teams in three simulated environments: cooperative foraging, predator-prey, and Overcooked. We also demonstrate our algorithm in a real-world multi-robot setting.

<title>Seeing Through the Brain: New Insights from Decoding Visual Stimuli with fMRI</title>

Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes visual information is a central challenge in neuroscience and machine learning. A promising approach is to reconstruct visual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a latent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct images. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is to the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces images from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best supports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual stimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more similar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based space or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the generative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of visual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and relationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that Projects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate representation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric diffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to reduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module that automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align with the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an 8% reduction in perceptual loss. These results highlight the importance of using structured text as the intermediate space to bridge fMRI signals and image reconstruction.

<title>Revealing Low-Dimensional Structure in 2D Richtmyer-Meshkov Instabilities via Parametric Reduced-Order Modeling</title>

Abstract: Efficient modeling of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) is essential to many engineering tasks, including high-speed combustion and drive and capsule geometry optimization in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF). In the latter, RMI causes the ablator and fuel to mix, introducing cold spots into the fuel and lowering performance; controlling RMI is thus a core ICF design concern. In this work, we introduce a reduced-order model for two-dimensional RMI based on the Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology in efficiently parametrizing the solution space over a high-dimensional parameter vector consisting of material EOS parameters and initial conditions known to affect RMI growth rates. Using only late-time partial observations of the dynamics, we use our framework to not only provide a highly efficient dynamic surrogate model, but to reveal that the RMI exhibits the structure of a surprisingly low-dimensional and linear dynamical system, into the nonlinear growth regime, after a suitable nonlinear transformation is applied to the material interface, which we approximate as a trained autoencoder. Our use of practical observables and fundamental parameters suggests that such ROMs may be useful for downstream engineering tasks which confront the RMI, while the low-dimensional representation suggests a new direction for theoretical work.

Abstract: Malicious agents pose significant threats to the reliability and decision-making capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses often fall short due to reactive designs or centralized architectures which may introduce single points of failure. To address these challenges, we propose SentinelNet, the first decentralized framework for proactively detecting and mitigating malicious behaviors in multi-agent collaboration. SentinelNet equips each agent with a credit-based detector trained via contrastive learning on augmented adversarial debate trajectories, enabling autonomous evaluation of message credibility and dynamic neighbor ranking via bottom-k elimination to suppress malicious communications. To overcome the scarcity of attack data, it generates adversarial trajectories simulating diverse threats, ensuring robust training. Experiments on MAS benchmarks show SentinelNet achieves near-perfect detection of malicious agents, close to 100% within two debate rounds, and recovers 95% of system accuracy from compromised baselines. By exhibiting strong generalizability across domains and attack patterns, SentinelNet establishes a novel paradigm for safeguarding collaborative MAS.

Abstract: What have language models (LMs) learned about grammar? This question remains hotly debated, with major ramifications for linguistic theory. However, since probability and grammaticality are distinct notions in linguistics, it is not obvious what string probabilities can reveal about an LM's underlying grammatical knowledge. We present a theoretical analysis of the relationship between grammar, meaning, and string probability, based on simple assumptions about the generative process of corpus data. Our framework makes three predictions, which we validate empirically using 280K sentence pairs in English and Chinese: (1) correlation between the probability of strings within minimal pairs, i.e., string pairs with minimal semantic differences; (2) correlation between models' and humans' deltas within minimal pairs; and (3) poor separation in probability space between unpaired grammatical and ungrammatical strings. Our analyses give theoretical grounding for using probability to learn about LMs' structural knowledge, and suggest directions for future work in LM grammatical evaluation.

Abstract: Climate change demands effective legislative action to mitigate its impacts. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) to understand the progression of climate policy from announcement to adoption, focusing on policies within the European Green Deal. We present a dataset of 165 policies, incorporating text and metadata. We aim to predict a policy's progression status, and compare text representation methods, including TF-IDF, BERT, and ClimateBERT. Metadata features are included to evaluate the impact on predictive performance. On text features alone, ClimateBERT outperforms other approaches (RMSE = 0.17, R^2 = 0.29), while BERT achieves superior performance with the addition of metadata features (RMSE = 0.16, R^2 = 0.38). Using methods from explainable AI highlights the influence of factors such as policy wording and metadata including political party and country representation. These findings underscore the potential of ML tools in supporting climate policy analysis and decision-making.

Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have demonstrated the power of deep neural architectures like the Evoformer for capturing complex spatial and evolutionary constraints on protein conformation. However, the depth of the Evoformer, comprising 48 stacked blocks, introduces high computational costs and rigid layerwise discretization. Inspired by Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth formulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural ODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This continuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the adjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and accuracy through adaptive ODE solvers. Benchmarking on protein structure prediction tasks, we find that the Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces structurally plausible predictions and reliably captures certain secondary structure elements, such as alpha-helices, though it does not fully replicate the accuracy of the original architecture. However, our model achieves this performance using dramatically fewer resources, just 17.5 hours of training on a single GPU, highlighting the promise of continuous-depth models as a lightweight and interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling. This work opens new directions for efficient and adaptive protein structure prediction frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) providers expose fine-tuning APIs that let end users fine-tune their frontier LLMs. Unfortunately, it has been shown that an adversary with fine-tuning access to an LLM can bypass safeguards. Particularly concerning, such attacks may avoid detection with datasets that are only implicitly harmful. Our work studies robust detection mechanisms for adversarial use of fine-tuning APIs. We introduce the concept of a fine-tuning auditing agent and show it can detect harmful fine-tuning prior to model deployment. We provide our auditing agent with access to the fine-tuning dataset, as well as the fine-tuned and pre-fine-tuned models, and request the agent assigns a risk score for the fine-tuning job. We evaluate our detection approach on a diverse set of eight strong fine-tuning attacks from the literature, along with five benign fine-tuned models, totaling over 1400 independent audits. These attacks are undetectable with basic content moderation on the dataset, highlighting the challenge of the task. With the best set of affordances, our auditing agent achieves a 56.2% detection rate of adversarial fine-tuning at a 1% false positive rate. Most promising, the auditor is able to detect covert cipher attacks that evade safety evaluations and content moderation of the dataset. While benign fine-tuning with unintentional subtle safety degradation remains a challenge, we establish a baseline configuration for further work in this area. We release our auditing agent at https://github.com/safety-research/finetuning-auditor.

Abstract: The evaluation of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agents is hindered by the coarse, end-task success metric that fails to provide precise skill diagnosis or measure robustness to real-world perturbations. This challenge is exacerbated by a fragmented data landscape that impedes reproducible research and the development of generalist models. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{NEBULA}, a unified ecosystem for single-arm manipulation that enables diagnostic and reproducible evaluation. NEBULA features a novel dual-axis evaluation protocol that combines fine-grained \textit{capability tests} for precise skill diagnosis with systematic \textit{stress tests} that measure robustness. A standardized API and a large-scale, aggregated dataset are provided to reduce fragmentation and support cross-dataset training and fair comparison. Using NEBULA, we demonstrate that top-performing VLAs struggle with key capabilities such as spatial reasoning and dynamic adaptation, which are consistently obscured by conventional end-task success metrics. By measuring both what an agent can do and when it does so reliably, NEBULA provides a practical foundation for robust, general-purpose embodied agents.

Abstract: Discrete representation learning has shown promising results across various domains, including generation and understanding in image, speech and language. Inspired by these advances, we propose MuseTok, a tokenization method for symbolic music, and investigate its effectiveness in both music generation and understanding tasks. MuseTok employs the residual vector quantized-variational autoencoder (RQ-VAE) on bar-wise music segments within a Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework, producing music codes that achieve high-fidelity music reconstruction and accurate understanding of music theory. For comprehensive evaluation, we apply MuseTok to music generation and semantic understanding tasks, including melody extraction, chord recognition, and emotion recognition. Models incorporating MuseTok outperform previous representation learning baselines in semantic understanding while maintaining comparable performance in content generation. Furthermore, qualitative analyses on MuseTok codes, using ground-truth categories and synthetic datasets, reveal that MuseTok effectively captures underlying musical concepts from large music collections.

Abstract: Reasoning Vision Language Action (VLA) models improve robotic instruction-following by generating step-by-step textual plans before low-level actions, an approach inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language models. Yet even with a correct textual plan, the generated actions can still miss the intended outcomes in the plan, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We formalize this phenomenon as a lack of embodied CoT faithfulness, and introduce a training-free, runtime policy steering method for reasoning-action alignment. Given a reasoning VLA's intermediate textual plan, our framework samples multiple candidate action sequences from the same model, predicts their outcomes via simulation, and uses a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) to select the sequence whose outcome best aligns with the VLA's own textual plan. Only executing action sequences that align with the textual reasoning turns our base VLA's natural action diversity from a source of error into a strength, boosting robustness to semantic and visual OOD perturbations and enabling novel behavior composition without costly re-training. We also contribute a reasoning-annotated extension of LIBERO-100, environment variations tailored for OOD evaluation, and demonstrate up to 15% performance gain over prior work on behavior composition tasks and scales with compute and data diversity.

Abstract: Despite the promising results of disentangled representation learning in discovering latent patterns in graph-structured data, few studies have explored disentanglement for hypergraph-structured data. Integrating hyperedge disentanglement into hypergraph neural networks enables models to leverage hidden hyperedge semantics, such as unannotated relations between nodes, that are associated with labels. This paper presents an analysis of hyperedge disentanglement from a category-theoretical perspective and proposes a novel criterion for disentanglement derived from the naturality condition. Our proof-of-concept model experimentally showed the potential of the proposed criterion by successfully capturing functional relations of genes (nodes) in genetic pathways (hyperedges).

Abstract: The development of automated experimental facilities and the digitization of experimental data have introduced numerous opportunities to radically advance chemical laboratories. As many laboratory tasks involve predicting and understanding previously unknown chemical relationships, machine learning (ML) approaches trained on experimental data can substantially accelerate the conventional design-build-test-learn process. This outlook article aims to help chemists understand and begin to adopt ML predictive models for a variety of laboratory tasks, including experimental design, synthesis optimization, and materials characterization. Furthermore, this article introduces how artificial intelligence (AI) agents based on large language models can help researchers acquire background knowledge in chemical or data science and accelerate various aspects of the discovery process. We present three case studies in distinct areas to illustrate how ML models and AI agents can be leveraged to reduce time-consuming experiments and manual data analysis. Finally, we highlight existing challenges that require continued synergistic effort from both experimental and computational communities to address.

Abstract: OpenLVLM-MIA is a new benchmark that highlights fundamental challenges in evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against large vision-language models (LVLMs). While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods converged to random chance under unbiased conditions. By offering a transparent and unbiased benchmark, OpenLVLM-MIA clarifies the current limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving techniques.

<title>Scaffold-Aware Generative Augmentation and Reranking for Enhanced Virtual Screening</title>

Abstract: Ligand-based virtual screening (VS) is an essential step in drug discovery that evaluates large chemical libraries to identify compounds that potentially bind to a therapeutic target. However, VS faces three major challenges: class imbalance due to the low active rate, structural imbalance among active molecules where certain scaffolds dominate, and the need to identify structurally diverse active compounds for novel drug development. We introduce ScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through three modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data conditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative AI, specifically a graph diffusion model. This helps mitigate the class imbalance and furthermore the structural imbalance, due to our proposed scaffold-aware sampling algorithm, designed to produce more samples for active molecules with underrepresented scaffolds. A model-agnostic self-training module is then used to safely integrate the generated synthetic data from our augmentation module with the original labeled data. Lastly, we introduce a reranking module that improves VS by enhancing scaffold diversity in the top recommended set of molecules, while still maintaining and even enhancing the overall general performance of identifying novel, active compounds. We conduct comprehensive computational experiments across five target classes, comparing ScaffAug against existing baseline methods by reporting the performance of multiple evaluation metrics and performing ablation studies on ScaffAug. Overall, this work introduces novel perspectives on effectively enhancing VS by leveraging generative augmentations, reranking, and general scaffold-awareness.

Abstract: Lung cancer, a malignancy originating in lung tissues, is commonly diagnosed and classified using medical imaging techniques, particularly computed tomography (CT). Despite the integration of machine learning and deep learning methods, the predictive efficacy of automated systems for lung cancer classification from CT images remains below the desired threshold for clinical adoption. Existing research predominantly focuses on binary classification, distinguishing between malignant and benign lung nodules. In this study, a novel deep learning-based approach is introduced, aimed at an improved multi-class classification, discerning various subtypes of lung cancer from CT images. Leveraging a pre-trained ResNet model, lung tissue images were classified into three distinct classes, two of which denote malignancy and one benign. Employing a dataset comprising 15,000 lung CT images sourced from the LC25000 histopathological images, the ResNet50 model was trained on 10,200 images, validated on 2,550 images, and tested on the remaining 2,250 images. Through the incorporation of custom layers atop the ResNet architecture and meticulous hyperparameter fine-tuning, a remarkable test accuracy of 98.8% was recorded. This represents a notable enhancement over the performance of prior models on the same dataset.

<title>Time-Embedded Algorithm Unrolling for Computational MRI</title>

Abstract: Algorithm unrolling methods have proven powerful for solving the regularized least squares problem in computational magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These approaches unfold an iterative algorithm with a fixed number of iterations, typically alternating between a neural network-based proximal operator for regularization, a data fidelity operation and auxiliary updates with learnable parameters. While the connection to optimization methods dictate that the proximal operator network should be shared across unrolls, this can introduce artifacts or blurring. Heuristically, practitioners have shown that using distinct networks may be beneficial, but this significantly increases the number of learnable parameters, making it challenging to prevent overfitting. To address these shortcomings, by taking inspirations from proximal operators with varying thresholds in approximate message passing (AMP) and the success of time-embedding in diffusion models, we propose a time-embedded algorithm unrolling scheme for inverse problems. Specifically, we introduce a novel perspective on the iteration-dependent proximal operation in vector AMP (VAMP) and the subsequent Onsager correction in the context of algorithm unrolling, framing them as a time-embedded neural network. Similarly, the scalar weights in the data fidelity operation and its associated Onsager correction are cast as time-dependent learnable parameters. Our extensive experiments on the fastMRI dataset, spanning various acceleration rates and datasets, demonstrate that our method effectively reduces aliasing artifacts and mitigates noise amplification, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we show that our time-embedding strategy extends to existing algorithm unrolling approaches, enhancing reconstruction quality without increasing the computational complexity significantly.

Abstract: Recent advances in post-training techniques have endowed Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced capabilities for tackling complex, logic-intensive tasks through the generation of supplementary planning tokens. This development raises a fundamental question: Are these models aware of what they "learn" and "think"? To address this, we define three core competencies: (1) awareness of learned latent policies, (2) generalization of these policies across domains, and (3) alignment between internal reasoning traces and final outputs. We empirically evaluate these abilities on several tasks, each designed to require learning a distinct policy. Furthermore, we contrast the profiles of models post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our findings indicate that RL-trained models not only demonstrate greater awareness of their learned behaviors and stronger generalizability to novel, structurally similar tasks than SFT models but also often exhibit weak alignment between their reasoning traces and final outputs, an effect most pronounced in GRPO-trained models.

<title>Manual2Skill++: Connector-Aware General Robotic Assembly from Instruction Manuals via Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Assembly hinges on reliably forming connections between parts; yet most robotic approaches plan assembly sequences and part poses while treating connectors as an afterthought. Connections represent the critical "last mile" of assembly execution, while task planning may sequence operations and motion plan may position parts, the precise establishment of physical connections ultimately determines assembly success or failure. In this paper, we consider connections as first-class primitives in assembly representation, including connector types, specifications, quantities, and placement locations. Drawing inspiration from how humans learn assembly tasks through step-by-step instruction manuals, we present Manual2Skill++, a vision-language framework that automatically extracts structured connection information from assembly manuals. We encode assembly tasks as hierarchical graphs where nodes represent parts and sub-assemblies, and edges explicitly model connection relationships between components. A large-scale vision-language model parses symbolic diagrams and annotations in manuals to instantiate these graphs, leveraging the rich connection knowledge embedded in human-designed instructions. We curate a dataset containing over 20 assembly tasks with diverse connector types to validate our representation extraction approach, and evaluate the complete task understanding-to-execution pipeline across four complex assembly scenarios in simulation, spanning furniture, toys, and manufacturing components with real-world correspondence.

<title>End-to-End Argument Mining through Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction</title>

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM) helps in automating the extraction of complex argumentative structures such as Argument Components (ACs) like Premise, Claim etc. and Argumentative Relations (ARs) like Support, Attack etc. in an argumentative text. Due to the inherent complexity of reasoning involved with this task, modelling dependencies between ACs and ARs is challenging. Most of the recent approaches formulate this task through a generative paradigm by flattening the argumentative structures. In contrast to that, this study jointly formulates the key tasks of AM in an end-to-end fashion using Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction (AASP) framework. The proposed AASP framework is based on the autoregressive structure prediction framework that has given good performance for several NLP tasks. AASP framework models the argumentative structures as constrained pre-defined sets of actions with the help of a conditional pre-trained language model. These actions build the argumentative structures step-by-step in an autoregressive manner to capture the flow of argumentative reasoning in an efficient way. Extensive experiments conducted on three standard AM benchmarks demonstrate that AASP achieves state-of-theart (SoTA) results across all AM tasks in two benchmarks and delivers strong results in one benchmark.

Abstract: The development of computer-assisted surgery systems depends on large-scale, annotated datasets. Current resources for cataract surgery often lack the diversity and annotation depth needed to train generalizable deep-learning models. To address this gap, we present a dataset of 3,000 phacoemulsification cataract surgery videos from two surgical centers, performed by surgeons with a range of experience levels. This resource is enriched with four annotation layers: temporal surgical phases, instance segmentation of instruments and anatomical structures, instrument-tissue interaction tracking, and quantitative skill scores based on the established competency rubrics like the ICO-OSCAR. The technical quality of the dataset is supported by a series of benchmarking experiments for key surgical AI tasks, including workflow recognition, scene segmentation, and automated skill assessment. Furthermore, we establish a domain adaptation baseline for the phase recognition task by training a model on a subset of surgical centers and evaluating its performance on a held-out center. The dataset and annotations are available in Google Form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmyMAPSTGrIy2sTnz0-TMw08ZagTimRulbAQcWdaPwDy187A/viewform?usp=dialog).

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming AI, opening new opportunities in sensitive and high-impact areas such as Mental Health (MH). Yet, despite these advancements, recent evidence reveals that smaller-scale models still struggle to deliver optimal performance in domain-specific applications. In this study, we present a cost-efficient yet powerful approach to improve MH assessment capabilities of an LLM, without relying on any computationally intensive techniques. Our lightweight method consists of a linear transformation applied to a specific layer's activations, leveraging steering vectors to guide the model's output. Remarkably, this intervention enables the model to achieve improved results across two distinct tasks: (1) identifying whether a Reddit post is useful for detecting the presence or absence of depressive symptoms (relevance prediction task), and (2) completing a standardized psychological screening questionnaire for depression based on users' Reddit post history (questionnaire completion task). Results highlight the untapped potential of steering mechanisms as computationally efficient tools for LLMs' MH domain adaptation.

<title>Conformal Prediction in The Loop: A Feedback-Based Uncertainty Model for Trajectory Optimization</title>

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a powerful statistical machine learning tool to construct uncertainty sets with coverage guarantees, which has fueled its extensive adoption in generating prediction regions for decision-making tasks, e.g., Trajectory Optimization (TO) in uncertain environments. However, existing methods predominantly employ a sequential scheme, where decisions rely unidirectionally on the prediction regions, and consequently the information from decision-making fails to be fed back to instruct CP. In this paper, we propose a novel Feedback-Based CP (Fb-CP) framework for shrinking-horizon TO with a joint risk constraint over the entire mission time. Specifically, a CP-based posterior risk calculation method is developed by fully leveraging the realized trajectories to adjust the posterior allowable risk, which is then allocated to future times to update prediction regions. In this way, the information in the realized trajectories is continuously fed back to the CP, enabling attractive feedback-based adjustments of the prediction regions and a provable online improvement in trajectory performance. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that such adjustments consistently maintain the coverage guarantees of the prediction regions, thereby ensuring provable safety. Additionally, we develop a decision-focused iterative risk allocation algorithm with theoretical convergence analysis for allocating the posterior allowable risk which closely aligns with Fb-CP. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to handle distribution shift. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated through benchmark experiments.

<title>MoReBench: Evaluating Procedural and Pluralistic Moral Reasoning in Language Models, More than Outcomes</title>

Abstract: As AI systems progress, we rely more on them to make decisions with us and for us. To ensure that such decisions are aligned with human values, it is imperative for us to understand not only what decisions they make but also how they come to those decisions. Reasoning language models, which provide both final responses and (partially transparent) intermediate thinking traces, present a timely opportunity to study AI procedural reasoning. Unlike math and code problems which often have objectively correct answers, moral dilemmas are an excellent testbed for process-focused evaluation because they allow for multiple defensible conclusions. To do so, we present MoReBench: 1,000 moral scenarios, each paired with a set of rubric criteria that experts consider essential to include (or avoid) when reasoning about the scenarios. MoReBench contains over 23 thousand criteria including identifying moral considerations, weighing trade-offs, and giving actionable recommendations to cover cases on AI advising humans moral decisions as well as making moral decisions autonomously. Separately, we curate MoReBench-Theory: 150 examples to test whether AI can reason under five major frameworks in normative ethics. Our results show that scaling laws and existing benchmarks on math, code, and scientific reasoning tasks fail to predict models' abilities to perform moral reasoning. Models also show partiality towards specific moral frameworks (e.g., Benthamite Act Utilitarianism and Kantian Deontology), which might be side effects of popular training paradigms. Together, these benchmarks advance process-focused reasoning evaluation towards safer and more transparent AI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet their deployment in high-stakes domains is hindered by inherent limitations in trustworthiness, including hallucinations, instability, and a lack of transparency. To address these challenges, we introduce a generic neuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The core of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline knowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an LLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic knowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and refined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain requirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is encoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes this encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a reliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task, we demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with state-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while maintaining trustworthiness. Crucially, with a human-verified and corrected knowledge base, our approach significantly outperforms even larger models, while exhibiting perfect determinism, enhanced stability against input perturbations, and inherent immunity to prompt injection attacks. By generating decisions grounded in symbolic reasoning, ATA offers a practical and controllable architecture for building the next generation of transparent, auditable, and reliable autonomous agents.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the untapped potential of Whisper, a well-established automatic speech recognition (ASR) foundation model, in the context of L2 spoken language assessment (SLA). Unlike prior studies that extrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a step further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and linguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight classifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs, our method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset, outperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach. Furthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary relevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even without task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal proficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential as a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.

Abstract: With the increasing ubiquity of AR/VR devices, the deployment of deep learning models on edge devices has become a critical challenge. These devices require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance. We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5 CPU (BCM2712 quad-core Arm A76 processor). Our method is also evaluated on compound benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly enhancing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has emerged as a promising solution to achieving unparalleled scalability in deep learning by decoupling model parameter count from computational cost. By activating only a small subset of parameters per sample, SMoE enables significant growth in model capacity while maintaining efficiency. However, SMoE struggles to adapt to distributional shifts, leading to reduced robustness under data contamination. In this work, we introduce SymphonySMoE, a novel family of SMoE that introduces a social graph to model interactions among experts. This graph-based structure enhances the token routing process, addressing the robustness challenges that are inherent in conventional SMoE designs. SymphonySMoE is lightweight, modular, and integrates seamlessly with existing SMoE-based models such as the XMoE and the Generalist Language Model. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence demonstrating SymphonySMoE's advantages over baseline SMoE. Extensive experiments on language modeling and visual instruction tuning validate our method's effectiveness. We further highlight the scalability of SymphonySMoE to models with 4.2 and 7.4 billion parameters, showcasing its applicability in fine-tuning tasks for large-scale systems.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities by integrating large language models with visual inputs. However, they often fail to utilize visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning. Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors, its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains. SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection (EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model (MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT) to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset (ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios. Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (sMoE) has become a pivotal approach for scaling large vision-language models, offering substantial capacity while maintaining computational efficiency through dynamic, sparse activation of experts. However, existing routing mechanisms, typically based on similarity scoring, struggle to effectively capture the underlying input structure. This limitation leads to a trade-off between expert specialization and balanced computation, hindering both scalability and performance. We propose Input Domain Aware MoE, a novel routing framework that leverages a probabilistic mixture model to better partition the input space. By modeling routing probabilities as a mixture of distributions, our method enables experts to develop clear specialization boundaries while achieving balanced utilization. Unlike conventional approaches, our routing mechanism is trained independently of task-specific objectives, allowing for stable optimization and decisive expert assignments. Empirical results on vision-language tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing sMoE approaches, achieving higher task performance and improved expert utilization balance.

Abstract: In many industrial settings, users wish to ask questions in natural language, the answers to which require assembling information from diverse structured data sources. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), applications can now translate natural language questions into a set of API calls or database calls, execute them, and combine the results into an appropriate natural language response. However, these applications remain impractical in realistic industrial settings because they do not cope with the data source heterogeneity that typifies such environments. In this work, we simulate the heterogeneity of real industry settings by introducing two extensions of the popular Spider benchmark dataset that require a combination of database and API calls. Then, we introduce a declarative approach to handling such data heterogeneity and demonstrate that it copes with data source heterogeneity significantly better than state-of-the-art LLM-based agentic or imperative code generation systems. Our augmented benchmarks are available to the research community.

Abstract: Designing effective agentic systems requires the seamless composition and integration of agents, tools, and models within dynamic and uncertain environments. Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval approaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and composition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete capability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component selection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and real-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured, automated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the knapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically testing candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our approach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable reuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five benchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at significantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the single-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate improvement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In multi-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from 37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The substantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method across diverse domains and budget constraints.

<title>Structured Temporal Causality for Interpretable Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and often unlabeled. Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS) representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS, enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.

Abstract: We propose a method for image categorization and retrieval that leverages graphs and a graph attention network (GAT)-based autoencoder. Our approach is representative-centric, that is, we execute the categorization and retrieval process via the representative models we construct for the images and image categories. We utilize a graph where nodes represent images (or their representatives) and edges capture similarity relationships. GAT highlights important features and relationships between images, enabling the autoencoder to construct context-aware latent representations that capture the key features of each image relative to its neighbors. We obtain category representatives from these embeddings and categorize a query image by comparing its representative to the category representatives. We then retrieve the most similar image to the query image within its identified category. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our representative-centric approach through experiments with both the GAT autoencoders and standard feature-based techniques.

Abstract: Advances in open-vocabulary semantic mapping and object navigation have enabled robots to perform an informed search of their environment for an arbitrary object. However, such zero-shot object navigation is typically designed for simple queries with an object name like "television" or "blue rug". Here, we consider more complex free-text queries with spatial relationships, such as "find the remote on the table" while still leveraging robustness of a semantic map. We present DIV-Nav, a real-time navigation system that efficiently addresses this problem through a series of relaxations: i) Decomposing natural language instructions with complex spatial constraints into simpler object-level queries on a semantic map, ii) computing the Intersection of individual semantic belief maps to identify regions where all objects co-exist, and iii) Validating the discovered objects against the original, complex spatial constrains via a LVLM. We further investigate how to adapt the frontier exploration objectives of online semantic mapping to such spatial search queries to more effectively guide the search process. We validate our system through extensive experiments on the MultiON benchmark and real-world deployment on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot using a Jetson Orin AGX.

<title>Few-Label Multimodal Modeling of SNP Variants and ECG Phenotypes Using Large Language Models for Cardiovascular Risk Stratification</title>

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification remains a major challenge due to its multifactorial nature and limited availability of high-quality labeled datasets. While genomic and electrophysiological data such as SNP variants and ECG phenotypes are increasingly accessible, effectively integrating these modalities in low-label settings is non-trivial. This challenge arises from the scarcity of well-annotated multimodal datasets and the high dimensionality of biological signals, which limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised models. To address this, we present a few-label multimodal framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to combine genetic and electrophysiological information for cardiovascular risk stratification. Our approach incorporates a pseudo-label refinement strategy to adaptively distill high-confidence labels from weakly supervised predictions, enabling robust model fine-tuning with only a small set of ground-truth annotations. To enhance the interpretability, we frame the task as a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning problem, prompting the model to produce clinically relevant rationales alongside predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of multimodal inputs, few-label supervision, and CoT reasoning improves robustness and generalizability across diverse patient profiles. Experimental results using multimodal SNP variants and ECG-derived features demonstrated comparable performance to models trained on the full dataset, underscoring the promise of LLM-based few-label multimodal modeling for advancing personalized cardiovascular care.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks. Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives -- reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption, while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed with different wording.

<title>Watch Where You Move: Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation and Excitation for Gait Recognition</title>

Abstract: Deep learning-based gait recognition has achieved great success in various applications. The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions containing more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static regions that are more susceptible to covariates. Experimental results show that GaitRDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Life satisfaction is a crucial facet of human well-being. Hence, research on life satisfaction is incumbent for understanding how individuals experience their lives and influencing interventions targeted at enhancing mental health and well-being. Life satisfaction has traditionally been measured using analog, complicated, and frequently error-prone methods. These methods raise questions concerning validation and propagation. However, this study demonstrates the potential for machine learning algorithms to predict life satisfaction with a high accuracy of 93.80% and a 73.00% macro F1-score. The dataset comes from a government survey of 19000 people aged 16-64 years in Denmark. Using feature learning techniques, 27 significant questions for assessing contentment were extracted, making the study highly reproducible, simple, and easily interpretable. Furthermore, clinical and biomedical large language models (LLMs) were explored for predicting life satisfaction by converting tabular data into natural language sentences through mapping and adding meaningful counterparts, achieving an accuracy of 93.74% and macro F1-score of 73.21%. It was found that life satisfaction prediction is more closely related to the biomedical domain than the clinical domain. Ablation studies were also conducted to understand the impact of data resampling and feature selection techniques on model performance. Moreover, the correlation between primary determinants with different age brackets was analyzed, and it was found that health condition is the most important determinant across all ages. This study demonstrates how machine learning, large language models and XAI can jointly contribute to building trust and understanding in using AI to investigate human behavior, with significant ramifications for academics and professionals working to quantify and comprehend subjective well-being.

<title>LANPO: Bootstrapping Language and Numerical Feedback for Reinforcement Learning in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large language models (LLMs) often relies on scalar rewards, a practice that discards valuable textual rationale buried in the rollouts, forcing the model to explore \textit{de novo} with each attempt and hindering sample efficiency. While LLMs can uniquely learn from language feedback provided in-context, naively integrating on-line experiences into RL training presents a paradox: feedback from the same problem risks information leakage and memorization, while feedback from different problems often leads to behavior collapse due to irrelevant context. To resolve this tension, we propose \textbf{Language-And-Numerical Policy Optimization (LANPO)}, a framework that cleanly separates the roles of feedback: language guides exploration, while numerical rewards drive optimization. LANPO builds a dynamic experience pool from past trials and introduces two principles to ensure feedback is effective: \emph{Reward-Agnostic Reflection} for safe intra-sample self-correction and \emph{Relevant Abstraction} to distill generalizable lessons from inter-sample experiences. Across mathematical reasoning benchmarks, LANPO enables 7B and 14B models to significantly outperform strong baselines trained with GRPO in test accuracy. Our work provides a robust method for integrating historical experiences into the LLM RL loop, creating more effective and data-efficient learning agents.

<title>Toward Understanding Security Issues in the Model Context Protocol Ecosystem</title>

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging open standard that enables AI-powered applications to interact with external tools through structured metadata. A rapidly growing ecosystem has formed around MCP, including a wide range of MCP hosts (i.e., Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, and Cline), MCP registries (i.e., mcp.so, MCP Market, MCP Store, Pulse MCP, Smithery, and npm), and thousands of community-contributed MCP servers. Although the MCP ecosystem is gaining traction, there has been little systematic study of its architecture and associated security risks. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of the MCP ecosystem. We decompose MCP ecosystem into three core components: hosts, registries, and servers, and study the interactions and trust relationships among them. Users search for servers on registries and configure them in the host, which translates LLM-generated output into external tool invocations provided by the servers and executes them. Our qualitative analysis reveals that hosts lack output verification mechanisms for LLM-generated outputs, enabling malicious servers to manipulate model behavior and induce a variety of security threats, including but not limited to sensitive data exfiltration. We uncover a wide range of vulnerabilities that enable attackers to hijack servers, due to the lack of a vetted server submission process in registries. To support our analysis, we collect and analyze a dataset of 67,057 servers from six public registries. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates that a substantial number of servers can be hijacked by attackers. Finally, we propose practical defense strategies for MCP hosts, registries, and users. We responsibly disclosed our findings to affected hosts and registries.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across diverse cultural contexts, making accurate cultural understanding essential. Prior evaluations have mostly focused on output-level performance, obscuring the factors that drive differences in responses, while studies using circuit analysis have covered few languages and rarely focused on culture. In this work, we trace LLMs' internal cultural understanding mechanisms by measuring activation path overlaps when answering semantically equivalent questions under two conditions: varying the target country while fixing the question language, and varying the question language while fixing the country. We also use same-language country pairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects. Results show that internal paths overlap more for same-language, cross-country questions than for cross-language, same-country questions, indicating strong language-specific patterns. Notably, the South Korea-North Korea pair exhibits low overlap and high variability, showing that linguistic similarity does not guarantee aligned internal representation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now capable of generating text that closely resembles human writing, making them powerful tools for content creation, but this growing ability has also made it harder to tell whether a piece of text was written by a human or by a machine. This challenge becomes even more serious for languages like Urdu, where there are very few tools available to detect AI-generated text. To address this gap, we propose a novel AI-generated text detection framework tailored for the Urdu language. A balanced dataset comprising 1,800 humans authored, and 1,800 AI generated texts, sourced from models such as Gemini, GPT-4o-mini, and Kimi AI was developed. Detailed linguistic and statistical analysis was conducted, focusing on features such as character and word counts, vocabulary richness (Type Token Ratio), and N-gram patterns, with significance evaluated through t-tests and MannWhitney U tests. Three state-of-the-art multilingual transformer models such as mdeberta-v3-base, distilbert-base-multilingualcased, and xlm-roberta-base were fine-tuned on this dataset. The mDeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest performance, with an F1-score 91.29 and accuracy of 91.26% on the test set. This research advances efforts in contesting misinformation and academic misconduct in Urdu-speaking communities and contributes to the broader development of NLP tools for low resource languages.

Abstract: Applications of machine learning in chemistry are often limited by the scarcity and expense of labeled data, restricting traditional supervised methods. In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring labeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the molecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs a one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical labels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this position-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class examples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to single-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed. Across academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our work enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically plausible reaction sites ($\geq90\%$), named reaction classes ($\geq40\%$), and final reactants ($\geq74\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work also provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by mapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing data scarcity.

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven enormously successful at using multiple layers of representation to learn relevant features of structured data. Encoding physical symmetries into these models can improve performance on difficult tasks, and recent work has motivated the principle of parameter symmetry breaking and restoration as a unifying mechanism underlying their hierarchical learning dynamics. We evaluate the role of parameter symmetry and network expressivity in the generalisation behaviour of neural networks when learning a real-space renormalisation group (RG) transformation, using the central limit theorem (CLT) as a test case map. We consider simple multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), and vary weight symmetries and activation functions across architectures. Our results reveal a competition between symmetry constraints and expressivity, with overly complex or overconstrained models generalising poorly. We analytically demonstrate this poor generalisation behaviour for certain constrained MLP architectures by recasting the CLT as a cumulant recursion relation and making use of an established framework to propagate cumulants through MLPs. We also empirically validate an extension of this framework from MLPs to GNNs, elucidating the internal information processing performed by these more complex models. These findings offer new insight into the learning dynamics of symmetric networks and their limitations in modelling structured physical transformations.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in diverse cross-modal tasks. However, object hallucination, where models produce plausible but inaccurate object descriptions, remains a significant challenge. In contrast to previous work focusing on LLM components, this paper is the first to trace LVLM hallucinations to visual encoders and identifies three key issues: statistical bias, inherent bias, and vulnerability. To address these challenges, we propose SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code will be released.

Abstract: Motivated by the geometric advantages of quaternions in representing rotations and postures, we propose a quaternion-valued supervised learning Hopfield-structured neural network (QSHNN) with a fully connected structure inspired by the classic Hopfield neural network (HNN). Starting from a continuous-time dynamical model of HNNs, we extend the formulation to the quaternionic domain and establish the existence and uniqueness of fixed points with asymptotic stability. For the learning rules, we introduce a periodic projection strategy that modifies standard gradient descent by periodically projecting each 4*4 block of the weight matrix onto the closest quaternionic structure in the least-squares sense. This approach preserves both convergence and quaternionic consistency throughout training. Benefiting from this rigorous mathematical foundation, the experimental model implementation achieves high accuracy, fast convergence, and strong reliability across randomly generated target sets. Moreover, the evolution trajectories of the QSHNN exhibit well-bounded curvature, i.e., sufficient smoothness, which is crucial for applications such as control systems or path planning modules in robotic arms, where joint postures are parameterized by quaternion neurons. Beyond these application scenarios, the proposed model offers a practical implementation framework and a general mathematical methodology for designing neural networks under hypercomplex or non-commutative algebraic structures.

Abstract: Test-time augmentation, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or tool use, critically depends on an interplay between a model's parametric knowledge and externally retrieved information. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this relationship remain poorly understood. Specifically, it is not clear how much pre-training knowledge is required to answer queries with a small number of augmentation steps, which is a desirable property in practice. To address this question, we formulate multi-step reasoning as an $s$-$t$ connectivity problem on a knowledge graph. We represent a model's pre-training parametric knowledge as a partial, potentially noisy subgraph. We view augmentation as querying an oracle for true edges that augment the model's knowledge. Then, we characterize the necessary and sufficient number of augmentation steps for the model to generate an accurate answer given partial prior knowledge. One key result shows a phase transition: if the prior knowledge graph over $n$ vertices is disconnected into small components, then finding a path via augmentation is inefficient and requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ queries. On the other hand, once the density of correct knowledge surpasses a threshold, forming a giant component, we can find paths with an expected constant number of queries.

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern diagnostics; however, interpreting high-resolution radiological data remains time-consuming and susceptible to variability among clinicians. Traditional image processing techniques often lack the precision, robustness, and speed required for real-time clinical use. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a deep learning framework for real-time medical image analysis designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple imaging modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. The proposed system integrates advanced neural network architectures such as U-Net, EfficientNet, and Transformer-based models with real-time optimization strategies including model pruning, quantization, and GPU acceleration. The framework enables flexible deployment on edge devices, local servers, and cloud infrastructures, ensuring seamless interoperability with clinical systems such as PACS and EHR. Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving classification accuracies above 92%, segmentation Dice scores exceeding 91%, and inference times below 80 milliseconds. Furthermore, visual explanation tools such as Grad-CAM and segmentation overlays enhance transparency and clinical interpretability. These results indicate that the proposed framework can substantially accelerate diagnostic workflows, reduce clinician workload, and support trustworthy AI integration in time-critical healthcare environments.

Abstract: Prompt optimization has emerged as an effective alternative to retraining for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing approaches treat evaluation as a black box, relying solely on numerical scores while offering limited insight into why a prompt succeeds or fails. They also depend heavily on trial-and-error refinements, which are difficult to interpret and control. In this paper, we introduce MA-SAPO, a Multi-Agent framework for Score-Aware Prompt Optimization. Compared to prior methods, MA-SAPO explicitly couples evaluation outcomes with structured reasoning to guide systematic edits. The framework specifically consists of two stages: during the Reasoning Phase, agents collaboratively explain metric scores, diagnose weaknesses, and synthesize targeted refinements that are stored as reusable reasoning assets; during the Test Phase, agents retrieve these assets to analyze optimized prompts and apply only evidence-grounded edits. By turning evaluation signals into interpretable reasoning chains, MA-SAPO produces prompt refinements that are more transparent, auditable, and controllable. Experiments on the HelpSteer1/2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over single-pass prompting, retrieval-augmented baselines, and prior multi-agent strategies, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: In order to provide a robot with the ability to understand and react to a user's natural language inputs, the natural language must be connected to the robot's underlying representations of the world. Recently, large language models (LLMs) and 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have become a popular choice for grounding natural language and representing the world. In this work, we address the challenge of using LLMs with 3DSGs to ground natural language. Existing methods encode the scene graph as serialized text within the LLM's context window, but this encoding does not scale to large or rich 3DSGs. Instead, we propose to use a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation to select a subset of the 3DSG relevant to the task. We encode a 3DSG in a graph database and provide a query language interface (Cypher) as a tool to the LLM with which it can retrieve relevant data for language grounding. We evaluate our approach on instruction following and scene question-answering tasks and compare against baseline context window and code generation methods. Our results show that using Cypher as an interface to 3D scene graphs scales significantly better to large, rich graphs on both local and cloud-based models. This leads to large performance improvements in grounded language tasks while also substantially reducing the token count of the scene graph content.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance but often lack interpretable reasoning. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Diverse Thinking Modes (DiMo), which enhances both performance and interpretability by simulating a structured debate among four specialized LLM agents. Each agent embodies a distinct reasoning paradigm, allowing the framework to collaboratively explore diverse cognitive approaches. Through iterative debate, agents challenge and refine initial responses, yielding more robust conclusions and an explicit, auditable reasoning chain. Across six benchmarks and under a unified open-source setup, DiMo improves accuracy over widely used single-model and debate baselines, with the largest gains on math. We position DiMo as a semantics-aware, Web-native multi-agent framework: it models human-machine intelligence with LLM agents that produce semantically typed, URL-annotated evidence chains for explanations and user-friendly interactions. Although our experiments use standard reasoning benchmarks, the framework is designed to be instantiated over Web corpora and knowledge graphs, combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with structured justifications that downstream systems can inspect and reuse.

Abstract: Effective visualization retrieval necessitates a clear definition of similarity. Despite the growing body of work in specialized visualization retrieval systems, a systematic approach to understanding visualization similarity remains absent. We introduce the Similarity Framework for Visualization Retrieval (Safire), a conceptual model that frames visualization similarity along two dimensions: comparison criteria and representation modalities. Comparison criteria identify the aspects that make visualizations similar, which we divide into primary facets (data, visual encoding, interaction, style, metadata) and derived properties (data-centric and human-centric measures). Safire connects what to compare with how comparisons are executed through representation modalities. We categorize existing representation approaches into four groups based on their levels of information content and visualization determinism: raster image, vector image, specification, and natural language description, together guiding what is computable and comparable. We analyze several visualization retrieval systems using Safire to demonstrate its practical value in clarifying similarity considerations. Our findings reveal how particular criteria and modalities align across different use cases. Notably, the choice of representation modality is not only an implementation detail but also an important decision that shapes retrieval capabilities and limitations. Based on our analysis, we provide recommendations and discuss broader implications for multimodal learning, AI applications, and visualization reproducibility.

Abstract: Prompt-based learning has emerged as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) approach to facilitate Large Language Model (LLM) adaptation to downstream tasks by conditioning generation with task-aware guidance. Despite its successes, current prompt-based learning methods heavily rely on laborious grid searching for optimal prompt length and typically require considerable number of prompts, introducing additional computational burden. Worse yet, our pioneer findings indicate that the task-aware prompt design is inherently limited by its absence of instance-aware information, leading to a subtle attention interplay with the input sequence. In contrast, simply incorporating instance-aware information as a part of the guidance can enhance the prompt-tuned model performance without additional fine-tuning. Moreover, we find an interesting phenomenon, namely "attention anchor", that incorporating instance-aware tokens at the earliest position of the sequence can successfully preserve strong attention to critical structural information and exhibit more active attention interaction with all input tokens. In light of our observation, we introduce Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT), an efficient and effective solution that leverages off-the-shelf, informative instance semantics into prompt-based learning. Our approach innovatively integrates both instance-aware and task-aware information in a nearly parameter-free manner (i.e., one single capsule prompt). Empirical results demonstrate that our method can exhibit superior performance across various language tasks (e.g., 84.03\% average accuracy on T5-Large), serving as an "attention anchor," while enjoying high parameter efficiency (e.g., 0.003\% of model parameters on Llama3.2-1B).

<title>Renaissance of RNNs in Streaming Clinical Time Series: Compact Recurrence Remains Competitive with Transformers</title>

Abstract: We present a compact, strictly causal benchmark for streaming clinical time series on the MIT--BIH Arrhythmia Database using per-second heart rate. Two tasks are studied under record-level, non-overlapping splits: near-term tachycardia risk (next ten seconds) and one-step heart rate forecasting. We compare a GRU-D (RNN) and a Transformer under matched training budgets against strong non-learned baselines. Evaluation is calibration-aware for classification and proper for forecasting, with temperature scaling and grouped bootstrap confidence intervals. On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence. Our results show that, in longitudinal monitoring, model choice is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, whereas compact Transformers deliver clearer gains for point forecasting.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to ground language in 3D understanding, remains a persistent challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We identify two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set (MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of 3D perception results from \textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of high-quality training data for future models.

Abstract: The classical notion of causal effect identifiability is defined in terms of treatment and outcome variables. In this note, we consider the identifiability of state-based causal effects: how an intervention on a particular state of treatment variables affects a particular state of outcome variables. We demonstrate that state-based causal effects may be identifiable even when variable-based causal effects may not. Moreover, we show that this separation occurs only when additional knowledge -- such as context-specific independencies and conditional functional dependencies -- is available. We further examine knowledge that constrains the states of variables, and show that such knowledge does not improve identifiability on its own but can improve both variable-based and state-based identifiability when combined with other knowledge such as context-specific independencies. Our findings highlight situations where causal effects of interest may be estimable from observational data and this identifiability may be missed by existing variable-based frameworks.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease has become increasingly prevalent in modern society and has a significant effect on global health and well-being. Heart-related conditions are intricate, multifaceted disorders, which may be influenced by a combination of genetic predispositions, lifestyle choices, and various socioeconomic and clinical factors. Information regarding these potentially complex interrelationships is dispersed among diverse types of textual data, which include patient narratives, medical records, and scientific literature, among others. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have increasingly been adopted as a powerful means to analyse and make sense of this vast amount of unstructured data. This, in turn, can allow healthcare professionals to gain deeper insights into the cardiology field, which has the potential to revolutionize current approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cardiac problems. This review provides a detailed overview of NLP research in cardiology between 2014 and 2025. We queried six literature databases to find articles describing the application of NLP techniques in the context of a range of different cardiovascular diseases. Following a rigorous screening process, we identified a total of 265 relevant articles. We analysed each article from multiple dimensions, i.e., NLP paradigm types, cardiology-related task types, cardiovascular disease types, and data source types. Our analysis reveals considerable diversity within each of these dimensions, thus demonstrating the considerable breadth of NLP research within the field. We also perform a temporal analysis, which illustrates the evolution and changing trends in NLP methods employed over the last decade that we cover. To our knowledge, the review constitutes the most comprehensive overview of NLP research in cardiology to date.

Abstract: We present HumanCM, a one-step human motion prediction framework built upon consistency models. Instead of relying on multi-step denoising as in diffusion-based methods, HumanCM performs efficient single-step generation by learning a self-consistent mapping between noisy and clean motion states. The framework adopts a Transformer-based spatiotemporal architecture with temporal embeddings to model long-range dependencies and preserve motion coherence. Experiments on Human3.6M and HumanEva-I demonstrate that HumanCM achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art diffusion models while reducing inference steps by up to two orders of magnitude.

<title>The Chameleon Nature of LLMs: Quantifying Multi-Turn Stance Instability in Search-Enabled Language Models</title>

Abstract: Integration of Large Language Models with search/retrieval engines has become ubiquitous, yet these systems harbor a critical vulnerability that undermines their reliability. We present the first systematic investigation of "chameleon behavior" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in search-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising 17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn conversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in state-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the Chameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use Rate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent failures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511), with GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small across-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a sampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations between source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes (r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that limited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query framing. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive consistency evaluation before deploying LLMs in healthcare, legal, and financial systems where maintaining coherent positions across interactions is critical for reliable decision support.

Abstract: Existing research on 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggles to achieve grounded question-answering, primarily due to the under-exploration of the mech- anism of human-like scene-object grounded reasoning. This paper bridges the gap by presenting a novel framework. We first introduce a grounded Chain-of- Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes (SCENECOT), decoupling a complex reasoning task into simpler and manageable problems, and building corresponding visual clues based on multimodal expert modules. To enable such a method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of CoT reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning and showing potential for extension to broader 3D scene understanding scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models internalize a structural trade-off between truthfulness and obsequious flattery, emerging from reward optimization that conflates helpfulness with polite submission. This latent bias, known as sycophancy, manifests as a preference for user agreement over principled reasoning. We introduce Beacon, a single-turn forced-choice benchmark that isolates this bias independent of conversational context, enabling precise measurement of the tension between factual accuracy and submissive bias. Evaluations across twelve state-of-the-art models reveal that sycophancy decomposes into stable linguistic and affective sub-biases, each scaling with model capacity. We further propose prompt-level and activation-level interventions that modulate these biases in opposing directions, exposing the internal geometry of alignment as a dynamic manifold between truthfulness and socially compliant judgment. Beacon reframes sycophancy as a measurable form of normative misgeneralization, providing a reproducible foundation for studying and mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems.

Abstract: Modern machine learning solutions require extensive data collection where labeling remains costly. To reduce this burden, open set active learning approaches aim to select informative samples from a large pool of unlabeled data that includes irrelevant or unknown classes. In this context, we propose Sharpness Aware Minimization for Open Set Active Learning (SAMOSA) as an effective querying algorithm. Building on theoretical findings concerning the impact of data typicality on the generalization properties of traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), SAMOSA actively queries samples based on their typicality. SAMOSA effectively identifies atypical samples that belong to regions of the embedding manifold close to the model decision boundaries. Therefore, SAMOSA prioritizes the samples that are (i) highly informative for the targeted classes, and (ii) useful for distinguishing between targeted and unwanted classes. Extensive experiments show that SAMOSA achieves up to 3% accuracy improvement over the state of the art across several datasets, while not introducing computational overhead.

<title>Region in Context: Text-condition Image editing with Human-like semantic reasoning</title>

Abstract: Recent research has made significant progress in localizing and editing image regions based on text. However, most approaches treat these regions in isolation, relying solely on local cues without accounting for how each part contributes to the overall visual and semantic composition. This often results in inconsistent edits, unnatural transitions, or loss of coherence across the image. In this work, we propose Region in Context, a novel framework for text-conditioned image editing that performs multilevel semantic alignment between vision and language, inspired by the human ability to reason about edits in relation to the whole scene. Our method encourages each region to understand its role within the global image context, enabling precise and harmonized changes. At its core, the framework introduces a dual-level guidance mechanism: regions are represented with full-image context and aligned with detailed region-level descriptions, while the entire image is simultaneously matched to a comprehensive scene-level description generated by a large vision-language model. These descriptions serve as explicit verbal references of the intended content, guiding both local modifications and global structure. Experiments show that it produces more coherent and instruction-aligned results. Code is available at: https://github.com/thuyvuphuong/Region-in-Context.git

Abstract: We argue that 3-D first-person video games are a challenging environment for real-time multi-modal reasoning. We first describe our dataset of human game-play, collected across a large variety of 3-D first-person games, which is both substantially larger and more diverse compared to prior publicly disclosed datasets, and contains text instructions. We demonstrate that we can learn an inverse dynamics model from this dataset, which allows us to impute actions on a much larger dataset of publicly available videos of human game play that lack recorded actions. We then train a text-conditioned agent for game playing using behavior cloning, with a custom architecture capable of realtime inference on a consumer GPU. We show the resulting model is capable of playing a variety of 3-D games and responding to text input. Finally, we outline some of the remaining challenges such as long-horizon tasks and quantitative evaluation across a large set of games.

Abstract: X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in artificial intelligence that can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens for clinicians and patient wait times. Existing MRG models predominantly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve report generation, with limited exploration of pre-trained vision foundation models or advanced fine-tuning techniques. Mainstream frameworks either avoid fine-tuning or utilize simplistic methods like LoRA, often neglecting the potential of enhancing cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, while Transformer-based models dominate vision-language tasks, non-Transformer architectures, such as the Mamba network, remain underexplored for medical report generation, presenting a promising avenue for future research. In this paper, we propose EMRRG, a novel X-ray report generation framework that fine-tunes pre-trained Mamba networks using parameter-efficient methods. Specifically, X-ray images are divided into patches, tokenized, and processed by an SSM-based vision backbone for feature extraction, with Partial LoRA yielding optimal performance. An LLM with a hybrid decoder generates the medical report, enabling end-to-end training and achieving strong results on benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed strategies for the X-ray MRG. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Medical_Image_Analysis.

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive, task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments. These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content. This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated sophisticated capabilities, including the ability to process and comprehend extended contexts. These emergent capabilities necessitate rigorous evaluation methods to effectively assess their performance in long-context understanding. In this paper, we present \textbf{LC-Eval}, a bilingual, multi-task evaluation benchmark designed to evaluate long-context understanding in English and Arabic, targeting context lengths ranging from 4k to over 128k tokens. LC-Eval introduces four novel and challenging tasks: multi-document question answering, bilingual question answering, claim verification within a paragraph, and multiple-choice questions based on long contexts. These tasks are designed to assess LLMs' abilities in deep reasoning, document comprehension, information tracing, and bilingual information extraction and understanding. The benchmark includes datasets in both Arabic and English for each task, allowing for a comparative analysis of their performance across different text genres. Evaluations were conducted on both open-weight and closed LLMs, with results indicating that LC-Eval presents significant challenges. Even high-performing models, such as GPT-4o, struggled with certain tasks, highlighting the complexity and rigor of the benchmark.

Abstract: LLM-powered coding agents, which operate in iterative loops (turns) to solve software engineering tasks, are becoming increasingly powerful. However, their practical deployment is hindered by significant and unpredictable costs. This challenge arises from a combination of factors: quadratically growing token counts with each turn, the high price of models, the large number of turns required for real-world tasks, and the tendency of agents to take inefficient or unnecessary actions. While existing research focuses on optimizing individual turns, the strategic control of the total number of turns remains an underexplored area for managing agent performance and cost. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on SWE-bench using three state-of-the-art models and evaluate the impact of three distinct turn-control strategies: an unrestricted baseline, a fixed-turn limit with reminders, and a novel dynamic-turn strategy that grants extensions on-demand. Our findings first reveal a fundamental trade-off in the unrestricted setting, where no single model excels across performance, cost, and turn efficiency. We then show that a fixed-turn limit, specifically at the 75th percentile of the baseline, serves as a "sweet spot", substantially reducing costs (by 24%-68%) with minimal impact on solve rates. Most significantly, the dynamic-turn strategy consistently outperforms fixed-limit approaches, achieving comparable or better solve rates while further reducing costs by an additional 12%-24% by intelligently allocating resources only to tasks that need them. This work provides the first systematic analysis of turn-control strategies, offering simple yet effective guidelines for developers to balance cost and efficacy. We demonstrate that dynamic resource allocation is a superior, easy-to-implement approach for deploying powerful yet economically viable coding agents.

Abstract: We introduce MOSAIC (Masked Objective with Selective Adaptation for In-domain Contrastive learning), a multi-stage framework for domain adaptation of sentence embedding models that incorporates joint domain-specific masked supervision. Our approach addresses the challenges of adapting large-scale general-domain sentence embedding models to specialized domains. By jointly optimizing masked language modeling (MLM) and contrastive objectives within a unified training pipeline, our method enables effective learning of domain-relevant representations while preserving the robust semantic discrimination properties of the original model. We empirically validate our approach on both high-resource and low-resource domains, achieving improvements up to 13.4% in NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) over strong general-domain baselines. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each component, highlighting the importance of balanced joint supervision and staged adaptation.

<title>Mixed-Precision Quantization for Language Models: Techniques and Prospects</title>

Abstract: The rapid scaling of language models (LMs) has resulted in unprecedented computational, memory, and energy requirements, making their training and deployment increasingly unsustainable. Quantization has emerged as an essential compression technique to reduce model size, alleviate memory bottlenecks, and accelerate inference. However, while uniform low-bit quantization (e.g., INT8, INT4) provides significant efficiency gains, it can degrade accuracy in sensitive components of transformer-based LMs. Mixed-precision quantization offers a promising alternative by selectively allocating precision across layers or within tensors to balance efficiency and accuracy. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Mixed-Precision quantization frameworks for LMs (MXPLMs). We first review quantization fundamentals, including uniform and non-uniform quantizers, quantization granularity, and methods widely used in post-training quantization. We then categorize and compare recent MXPLM frameworks according to their bit allocation strategies and precision configurations across weights, activations, and key-value caches. A comparative analysis highlights differences in perplexity, zero-shot task performance, and deployment trade-offs. Furthermore, we contrast MXPLMs with earlier mixed-precision quantization methods for deep neural networks, identifying strategies that transfer and those that face challenges in the LM setting. Finally, we summarize open issues and future directions, including hardware-aware design, activation quantization, and scalable optimization methods for billion-parameter models. By consolidating recent advances, this work serves as a reference for understanding the current landscape and research prospects of mixed-precision quantization for large-scale language models.

<title>Improving Model Representation and Reducing KV Cache via Skip Connections with First Value Heads</title>

Abstract: Transformer models have driven breakthroughs across various language tasks by their strong capability to learn rich contextual representations. Scaling them to improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and compute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive decoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation without bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve expressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of weaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer variant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to strengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very first layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections and V cache by nearly 50 \%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed first-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression and accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of Transformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model scales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \% in KV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe for uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only 10-15\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine advanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to achieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined with YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \% while still improving performance.

<title>When Many-Shot Prompting Fails: An Empirical Study of LLM Code Translation</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with vast context windows offer new avenues for in-context learning (ICL), where providing many examples ("many-shot" prompting) is often assumed to enhance performance. We investigate this assumption for the complex task of code translation. Through a large-scale empirical study of over 90,000 translations, we systematically evaluate the impact of scaling in-context examples from zero-shot to many-shot configurations of up to 625 examples, with prompts spanning from approximately 100,000 to 800,000 tokens. Our findings reveal a "many-shot paradox": while static similarity metrics may modestly improve with more examples, functional correctness consistently peaks with few-shot prompting (5-25 examples). Providing substantially more examples often degrades this crucial functional performance. This study highlights that for code translation, the quality of a few well-chosen examples outweighs sheer quantity, challenging the universal efficacy of "more is better" for ICL and underscoring the task-dependent nature of optimal prompting strategies. Our results have significant implications for effectively leveraging LLMs in software engineering.

Abstract: Archaeological predictive modelling estimates where undiscovered sites are likely to occur by combining known locations with environmental, cultural, and geospatial variables. We address this challenge using a deep learning approach but must contend with structural label scarcity inherent to archaeology: positives are rare, and most locations are unlabeled. To address this, we adopt a semi-supervised, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning strategy, implemented as a semantic segmentation model and evaluated on two datasets covering a representative range of archaeological periods. Our approach employs dynamic pseudolabeling, refined with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implemented via an RNN, increasing label confidence under severe class imbalance. On a geospatial dataset derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), our model performs on par with the state-of-the-art, LAMAP, while achieving higher Dice scores. On raw satellite imagery, assessed end-to-end with stratified k-fold cross-validation, it maintains performance and yields predictive surfaces with improved interpretability. Overall, our results indicate that semi-supervised learning offers a promising approach to identifying undiscovered sites across large, sparsely annotated landscapes.

<title>Knowing the Facts but Choosing the Shortcut: Understanding How Large Language Models Compare Entities</title>

arXiv:2510.16815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for knowledge-based reasoning tasks, yet understanding when they rely on genuine knowledge versus superficial heuristics remains challenging. We investigate this question through entity comparison tasks by asking models to compare entities along numerical attributes (e.g., ``Which river is longer, the Danube or the Nile?''), which offer clear ground truth for systematic analysis. Despite having sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make predictions that contradict this knowledge. We identify three heuristic biases that strongly influence model predictions: entity popularity, mention order, and semantic co-occurrence. For smaller models, a simple logistic regression using only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the model's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override principled reasoning. Crucially, we find that larger models (32B parameters) selectively rely on numerical knowledge when it is more reliable, while smaller models (7--8B parameters) show no such discrimination, which explains why larger models outperform smaller ones even when the smaller models possess more accurate knowledge. Chain-of-thought prompting steers all models towards using the numerical features across all model sizes.

<title>Efficient High-Accuracy PDEs Solver with the Linear Attention Neural Operator</title>

Abstract: Neural operators offer a powerful data-driven framework for learning mappings between function spaces, in which the transformer-based neural operator architecture faces a fundamental scalability-accuracy trade-off: softmax attention provides excellent fidelity but incurs quadratic complexity $\mathcal{O}(N^2 d)$ in the number of mesh points $N$ and hidden dimension $d$, while linear attention variants reduce cost to $\mathcal{O}(N d^2)$ but often suffer significant accuracy degradation. To address the aforementioned challenge, in this paper, we present a novel type of neural operators, Linear Attention Neural Operator (LANO), which achieves both scalability and high accuracy by reformulating attention through an agent-based mechanism. LANO resolves this dilemma by introducing a compact set of $M$ agent tokens $(M \ll N)$ that mediate global interactions among $N$ tokens. This agent attention mechanism yields an operator layer with linear complexity $\mathcal{O}(MN d)$ while preserving the expressive power of softmax attention. Theoretically, we demonstrate the universal approximation property, thereby demonstrating improved conditioning and stability properties. Empirically, LANO surpasses current state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers, including Transolver with slice-based softmax attention, achieving average $19.5\%$ accuracy improvement across standard benchmarks. By bridging the gap between linear complexity and softmax-level performance, LANO establishes a scalable, high-accuracy foundation for scientific machine learning applications.

Abstract: Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets, which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and (ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and conservation.

<title>Who's Asking? Simulating Role-Based Questions for Conversational AI Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Language model users often embed personal and social context in their questions. The asker's role -- implicit in how the question is framed -- creates specific needs for an appropriate response. However, most evaluations, while capturing the model's capability to respond, often ignore who is asking. This gap is especially critical in stigmatized domains such as opioid use disorder (OUD), where accounting for users' contexts is essential to provide accessible, stigma-free responses. We propose CoRUS (COmmunity-driven Roles for User-centric Question Simulation), a framework for simulating role-based questions. Drawing on role theory and posts from an online OUD recovery community (r/OpiatesRecovery), we first build a taxonomy of asker roles -- patients, caregivers, practitioners. Next, we use it to simulate 15,321 questions that embed each role's goals, behaviors, and experiences. Our evaluations show that these questions are both highly believable and comparable to real-world data. When used to evaluate five LLMs, for the same question but differing roles, we find systematic differences: vulnerable roles, such as patients and caregivers, elicit more supportive responses (+17%) and reduced knowledge content (-19%) in comparison to practitioners. Our work demonstrates how implicitly signaling a user's role shapes model responses, and provides a methodology for role-informed evaluation of conversational AI.

Abstract: We propose Schr\"odinger Bridge Mamba (SBM), a new concept of training-inference framework motivated by the inherent compatibility between Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) training paradigm and selective state-space model Mamba. We exemplify the concept of SBM with an implementation for generative speech enhancement. Experiments on a joint denoising and dereverberation task using four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SBM, with only 1-step inference, outperforms strong baselines with 1-step or iterative inference and achieves the best real-time factor (RTF). Beyond speech enhancement, we discuss the integration of SB paradigm and selective state-space model architecture based on their underlying alignment, which indicates a promising direction for exploring new deep generative models potentially applicable to a broad range of generative tasks.

Abstract: Generating professional financial reports is a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding process that current AI systems struggle to fully automate. To address this challenge, we introduce FinSight (Financial InSight), a novel multi agent framework for producing high-quality, multimodal financial reports. The foundation of FinSight is the Code Agent with Variable Memory (CAVM) architecture, which unifies external data, designed tools, and agents into a programmable variable space, enabling flexible data collection, analysis and report generation through executable code. To ensure professional-grade visualization, we propose an Iterative Vision-Enhanced Mechanism that progressively refines raw visual outputs into polished financial charts. Furthermore, a two stage Writing Framework expands concise Chain-of-Analysis segments into coherent, citation-aware, and multimodal reports, ensuring both analytical depth and structural consistency. Experiments on various company and industry-level tasks demonstrate that FinSight significantly outperforms all baselines, including leading deep research systems in terms of factual accuracy, analytical depth, and presentation quality, demonstrating a clear path toward generating reports that approach human-expert quality.

Abstract: The ever-increasing scale of modern neural networks has brought unprecedented performance alongside daunting challenges in efficiency and interpretability. This paper addresses the core question of how to build large neural systems that learn efficient, modular, and interpretable representations. We propose Neuronal Group Communication (NGC), a theory-driven framework that reimagines a neural network as a dynamical system of interacting neuronal groups rather than a monolithic collection of neural weights. Instead of treating each weight as an independent trainable parameter, NGC treats weights as transient interactions between embedding-like neuronal states, with neural computation unfolding through iterative communication among groups of neurons. This low-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons exchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and inter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant parameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal stability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the contraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence processing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities correspond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the neural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability. Empirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate improved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate compression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and cross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured neuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional learning systems.

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents, capable of complex planning and action, represent a significant technological evolution beyond current generative tools. As these systems become integrated into political and economic life, their distribution and capabilities will be highly consequential. This paper introduces and explores "agentic inequality" - the potential disparities in power, opportunity, and outcomes stemming from differential access to, and capabilities of, AI agents. We analyse the dual potential of this technology, exploring how agents could both exacerbate existing divides and, under the right conditions, serve as a powerful equalising force. To this end, the paper makes three primary contributions. First, it establishes an analytical framework by delineating the three core dimensions through which this inequality can manifest: disparities in the availability, quality, and quantity of agents. Second, it argues that agentic inequality is distinct from prior technological divides. Unlike tools that primarily augment human abilities, agents act as autonomous delegates, creating novel power asymmetries through scalable goal delegation and direct agent-to-agent competition that are poised to reshape outcomes across economic and socio-political spheres. Finally, it provides a systematic analysis of the technical and socioeconomic drivers - from model release strategies to market incentives - that will shape the distribution of agentic power, concluding with a research agenda for navigating the complex governance challenges ahead.

Abstract: The escalating threat of weapon-related violence necessitates automated detection systems capable of pixel-level precision for accurate threat assessment in real-time security applications. Traditional weapon detection approaches rely on object detection frameworks that provide only coarse bounding box localizations, lacking the fine-grained segmentation required for comprehensive threat analysis. Furthermore, existing semantic segmentation models either sacrifice accuracy for computational efficiency or require excessive computational resources incompatible with edge deployment scenarios. This paper presents ArmFormer, a lightweight transformer-based semantic segmentation framework that strategically integrates Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) with MixVisionTransformer architecture to achieve superior accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. Our approach combines CBAM-enhanced encoder backbone with attention-integrated hamburger decoder to enable multi-class weapon segmentation across five categories: handgun, rifle, knife, revolver, and human. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArmFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance with 80.64% mIoU and 89.13% mFscore while maintaining real-time inference at 82.26 FPS. With only 4.886G FLOPs and 3.66M parameters, ArmFormer outperforms heavyweight models requiring up to 48x more computation, establishing it as the optimal solution for deployment on portable security cameras, surveillance drones, and embedded AI accelerators in distributed security infrastructure.

Abstract: Vehicle aerodynamics optimization has become critical for automotive electrification, where drag reduction directly determines electric vehicle range and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches face an intractable trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations -- inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations generated using $\text{STAR-CCM+}^\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided Design (CAD) parameters via Free Form Deformation (FFD) algorithms, including complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization in automotive development. Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for integrating high-fidelity physics simulations with Artificial Intelligence (AI) across engineering disciplines where computational constraints currently limit innovation.

Abstract: Using a nearly-frozen pretrained model, the continual representation learning paradigm reframes parameter updates as a similarity-matching problem to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, directly leveraging pretrained features for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the similarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally prohibitive for real-time, low-latency applications. Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose Fly-CL, a bio-inspired framework compatible with a wide range of pretrained backbones. Fly-CL substantially reduces training time while achieving performance comparable to or exceeding that of current state-of-the-art methods. We theoretically show how Fly-CL progressively resolves multicollinearity, enabling more effective similarity matching with low time complexity. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse network architectures and data regimes validate Fly-CL's effectiveness in addressing this challenge through a biologically inspired design.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a commonly used technique to adapt large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In practice, SFT on a full dataset is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset training. To address these limitations, this work develops \textbf{UDS (Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to full-dataset fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/UDS.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend text-based LLMs with auditory understanding, offering new opportunities for multimodal applications. While their perception, reasoning, and task performance have been widely studied, their safety alignment under paralinguistic variation remains underexplored. This work systematically investigates the role of speaker emotion. We construct a dataset of malicious speech instructions expressed across multiple emotions and intensities, and evaluate several state-of-the-art LALMs. Our results reveal substantial safety inconsistencies: different emotions elicit varying levels of unsafe responses, and the effect of intensity is non-monotonic, with medium expressions often posing the greatest risk. These findings highlight an overlooked vulnerability in LALMs and call for alignment strategies explicitly designed to ensure robustness under emotional variation, a prerequisite for trustworthy deployment in real-world settings.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electricity prices is crucial for stakeholders in the energy market, particularly for grid operators, energy producers, and consumers. This study focuses on developing a predictive model leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast day-ahead electricity prices in the California energy market. The model incorporates a variety of features, including historical price data, weather conditions, and the energy generation mix. A novel custom loss function that integrates Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), and a smoothness penalty is introduced to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, an online learning approach is implemented to allow the model to adapt to new data incrementally, ensuring continuous relevance and accuracy. The results demonstrate that the custom loss function can improve the model's performance, aligning predicted prices more closely with actual values, particularly during peak intervals. Also, the online learning model outperforms other models by effectively incorporating real-time data, resulting in lower prediction error and variability. The inclusion of the energy generation mix further enhances the model's predictive capabilities, highlighting the importance of comprehensive feature integration. This research provides a robust framework for electricity price forecasting, offering valuable insights and tools for better decision-making in dynamic electricity markets.

Abstract: The effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is significantly hindered by unstructured clinical documentation, which results in noisy, inconsistent, and logically fragmented training data. To address this challenge, we present a knowledge-driven framework that integrates the standardized clinical terminology SNOMED CT with the Neo4j graph database to construct a structured medical knowledge graph. In this graph, clinical entities such as diseases, symptoms, and medications are represented as nodes, and semantic relationships such as ``caused by,'' ``treats,'' and ``belongs to'' are modeled as edges in Neo4j, with types mapped from formal SNOMED CT relationship concepts (e.g., \texttt{Causative agent}, \texttt{Indicated for}). This design enables multi-hop reasoning and ensures terminological consistency. By extracting and standardizing entity-relationship pairs from clinical texts, we generate structured, JSON-formatted datasets that embed explicit diagnostic pathways. These datasets are used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), significantly improving the clinical logic consistency of their outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that our knowledge-guided approach enhances the validity and interpretability of AI-generated diagnostic reasoning, providing a scalable solution for building reliable AI-assisted clinical systems.

Abstract: How can short-term energy consumption be accurately forecasted when sensor data is noisy, incomplete, and lacks contextual richness? This question guided our participation in the \textit{2025 Competition on Electric Energy Consumption Forecast Adopting Multi-criteria Performance Metrics}, which challenged teams to predict next-day power demand using real-world high-frequency data. We proposed a robust yet lightweight Deep Learning (DL) pipeline combining hourly downsizing, dual-mode imputation (mean and polynomial regression), and comprehensive normalization, ultimately selecting Standard Scaling for optimal balance. The lightweight GRU-LSTM sequence-to-one model achieves an average RMSE of 601.9~W, MAE of 468.9~W, and 84.36\% accuracy. Despite asymmetric inputs and imputed gaps, it generalized well, captured nonlinear demand patterns, and maintained low inference latency. Notably, spatiotemporal heatmap analysis reveals a strong alignment between temperature trends and predicted consumption, further reinforcing the model's reliability. These results demonstrate that targeted preprocessing paired with compact recurrent architectures can still enable fast, accurate, and deployment-ready energy forecasting in real-world conditions.

Abstract: To adapt effectively to dynamic real-world environments, intelligent systems must continually acquire new skills while generalizing them to diverse, unseen scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel and realistic setting named domain generalizable continual learning (DGCL): a model learns sequential tasks with each involving a single domain, aiming to perform well across all encountered tasks and domains. This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring, retaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for robust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL) methods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific generalization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains for each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach tailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human brain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in representation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across various domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized predictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates state-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and parameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive experiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge from DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation.

Abstract: Knowledge editing offers an efficient way to update model knowledge without full retraining, but prior work has concentrated almost exclusively on textual or visual modalities. We introduce SAKE, the first benchmark specifically designed for editing auditory attribute knowledge in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs). Unlike factual updates, SAKE targets several abstract auditory attributes, capturing knowledge types that go beyond conventional textual and visual domains. We benchmark seven editing methods on two LALMs along four dimensions: reliability, generality, audio/text locality, and portability. Results highlight challenges such as preserving intra-attribute knowledge unrelated to the edit, generalizing edits to multimodal reasoning, and maintaining edits under sequential updates. SAKE provides a principled framework to study how knowledge editing extends to the auditory modalities, opening new directions for maintaining and adapting LALMs in more diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in safety critical applications like autonomous driving use simulations to test their robustness against adversarial attacks in realistic conditions. However, these simulations are non-differentiable, forcing researchers to create attacks that do not integrate simulation environmental factors, reducing attack success. To address this limitation, we introduce UNDREAM, the first software framework that bridges the gap between photorealistic simulators and differentiable renderers to enable end-to-end optimization of adversarial perturbations on any 3D objects. UNDREAM enables manipulation of the environment by offering complete control over weather, lighting, backgrounds, camera angles, trajectories, and realistic human and object movements, thereby allowing the creation of diverse scenes. We showcase a wide array of distinct physically plausible adversarial objects that UNDREAM enables researchers to swiftly explore in different configurable environments. This combination of photorealistic simulation and differentiable optimization opens new avenues for advancing research of physical adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Recent leaps in large language models (LLMs) caused a revolution in programming tools (like GitHub Copilot) that can help with code generation, debugging, and even performance optimization. In this paper, we focus on the capabilities of the most recent reasoning models to generate optimized CUDA code for predefined, well-known tasks. Our objective is to determine which types of code optimizations and parallel patterns the LLMs can perform by themselves and whether they can be improved by tutoring (providing more detailed hints and guidelines in the prompt). The generated solutions were evaluated both automatically (for correctness and speedup) and manually (code reviews) to provide a more detailed perspective. We also tried an interactive approach where the LLM can fix its previous mistakes within a session. The results indicate that LLMs are quite skilled coders; however, they require tutoring to reach optimized solutions provided by parallel computing experts.

Abstract: This work introduces Probabilistic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (P-KAN), a novel probabilistic extension of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for time series forecasting. By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting, where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions. The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained domains.

<title>Peering Inside the Black Box: Uncovering LLM Errors in Optimization Modelling through Component-Level Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to convert natural language descriptions into mathematical optimization formulations. Current evaluations often treat formulations as a whole, relying on coarse metrics like solution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors. In this study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework for LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our framework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision variables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error (RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of varying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5 consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver performance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint RMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability. Constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while concise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight three principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint coverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures solver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational efficiency. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for fine-grained, diagnostic evaluation of LLMs in optimization modeling.

<title>Quantile Regression, Variational Autoencoders, and Diffusion Models for Uncertainty Quantification: A Spatial Analysis of Sub-seasonal Wind Speed Prediction</title>

Abstract: This study aims to improve the spatial representation of uncertainties when regressing surface wind speeds from large-scale atmospheric predictors for sub-seasonal forecasting. Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024) demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion, deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) accelerates training of large language models (LLMs) but poses intellectual property protection and LLM diversity risks. Existing KD detection methods based on self-identity or output similarity can be easily evaded through prompt engineering. We present a KD detection framework effective in both white-box and black-box settings by exploiting an overlooked signal: the transfer of MoE "structural habits", especially internal routing patterns. Our approach analyzes how different experts specialize and collaborate across various inputs, creating distinctive fingerprints that persist through the distillation process. To extend beyond the white-box setup and MoE architectures, we further propose Shadow-MoE, a black-box method that constructs proxy MoE representations via auxiliary distillation to compare these patterns between arbitrary model pairs. We establish a comprehensive, reproducible benchmark that offers diverse distilled checkpoints and an extensible framework to facilitate future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate >94% detection accuracy across various scenarios and strong robustness to prompt-based evasion, outperforming existing baselines while highlighting the structural habits transfer in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly foundation models (FMs), have revolutionized medical image analysis, demonstrating strong zero- and few-shot performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, from segmentation to report generation. Unlike traditional task-specific AI models, FMs leverage large corpora of labeled and unlabeled multimodal datasets to learn generalized representations that can be adapted to various downstream clinical applications with minimal fine-tuning. However, despite the rapid proliferation of FM research in medical imaging, the field remains fragmented, lacking a unified synthesis that systematically maps the evolution of architectures, training paradigms, and clinical applications across modalities. To address this gap, this review article provides a comprehensive and structured analysis of FMs in medical image analysis. We systematically categorize studies into vision-only and vision-language FMs based on their architectural foundations, training strategies, and downstream clinical tasks. Additionally, a quantitative meta-analysis of the studies was conducted to characterize temporal trends in dataset utilization and application domains. We also critically discuss persistent challenges, including domain adaptation, efficient fine-tuning, computational constraints, and interpretability along with emerging solutions such as federated learning, knowledge distillation, and advanced prompting. Finally, we identify key future research directions aimed at enhancing the robustness, explainability, and clinical integration of FMs, thereby accelerating their translation into real-world medical practice.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow models achieve high generative quality but remain computationally expensive due to slow multi-step sampling. Distillation methods accelerate them by training fast student generators, yet most existing objectives lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this work, we propose Di-Bregman, a compact framework that formulates diffusion distillation as Bregman divergence-based density-ratio matching. This convex-analytic view connects several existing objectives through a common lens. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and text-to-image generation demonstrate that Di-Bregman achieves improved one-step FID over reverse-KL distillation and maintains high visual fidelity compared to the teacher model. Our results highlight Bregman density-ratio matching as a practical and theoretically-grounded route toward efficient one-step diffusion generation.

Abstract: Bengali social media platforms have witnessed a sharp increase in hate speech, disproportionately affecting women and adolescents. While datasets such as BD-SHS provide a basis for structured evaluation, most prior approaches rely on either computationally costly full-model fine-tuning or proprietary APIs. This paper presents the first application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for Bengali hate speech detection using LoRA and QLoRA. Three instruction-tuned large language models - Gemma-3-4B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B - were fine-tuned on the BD-SHS dataset of 50,281 annotated comments. Each model was adapted by training fewer than 1% of its parameters, enabling experiments on a single consumer-grade GPU. The results show that Llama-3.2-3B achieved the highest F1-score of 92.23%, followed by Mistral-7B at 88.94% and Gemma-3-4B at 80.25%. These findings establish PEFT as a practical and replicable strategy for Bengali and related low-resource languages.

Abstract: The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation) fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.

Abstract: Ensuring the long-term reliability of AI models in clinical practice requires continuous performance monitoring and corrective actions when degradation occurs. Addressing this need, this manuscript presents ReclAIm, a multi-agent framework capable of autonomously monitoring, evaluating, and fine-tuning medical image classification models. The system, built on a large language model core, operates entirely through natural language interaction, eliminating the need for programming expertise. ReclAIm successfully trains, evaluates, and maintains consistent performance of models across MRI, CT, and X-ray datasets. Once ReclAIm detects significant performance degradation, it autonomously executes state-of-the-art fine-tuning procedures that substantially reduce the performance gap. In cases with performance drops of up to -41.1% (MRI InceptionV3), ReclAIm managed to readjust performance metrics within 1.5% of the initial model results. ReclAIm enables automated, continuous maintenance of medical imaging AI models in a user-friendly and adaptable manner that facilitates broader adoption in both research and clinical environments.

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has been popular to launch a series of LLM inferences -- we call an LLM application -- to better solve real-world problems. When serving those applications in shared GPU servers, the schedulers are expected to attain fast application completions with guaranteed worst-case performance. However, mainstream LLM schedulers fail to behave well for LLM applications -- due to head-of-line blocking or over-constrained resource allocation. In this paper, we propose to serve LLM applications in a fair and also efficient manner. To this end, we design Justitia, a novel scheduler with three key techniques. First, given that memory is prevalently a bottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the service cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Meanwhile, it uses a simple neural network model to conduct light-weight and also accurate demand prediction. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing algorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay. We have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving diverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling efficiency with fairness preserved.

Abstract: Cardiac catheterization remains a cornerstone of minimally invasive interventions, yet it continues to rely heavily on manual operation. Despite advances in robotic platforms, existing systems are predominantly follow-leader in nature, requiring continuous physician input and lacking intelligent autonomy. This dependency contributes to operator fatigue, more radiation exposure, and variability in procedural outcomes. This work moves towards autonomous catheter navigation by introducing DINO-CVA, a multimodal goal-conditioned behavior cloning framework. The proposed model fuses visual observations and joystick kinematics into a joint embedding space, enabling policies that are both vision-aware and kinematic-aware. Actions are predicted autoregressively from expert demonstrations, with goal conditioning guiding navigation toward specified destinations. A robotic experimental setup with a synthetic vascular phantom was designed to collect multimodal datasets and evaluate performance. Results show that DINO-CVA achieves high accuracy in predicting actions, matching the performance of a kinematics-only baseline while additionally grounding predictions in the anatomical environment. These findings establish the feasibility of multimodal, goal-conditioned architectures for catheter navigation, representing an important step toward reducing operator dependency and improving the reliability of catheterbased therapies.

Abstract: Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in substantial computational overhead during both training and inference. Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this "thinking" process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel, theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the gap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any training, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced by 58.6% compared to the RL model.

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some examples in this paper may be upsetting.

Abstract: While advancements in quantization have significantly reduced the computational costs of inference in deep learning, training still predominantly relies on complex floating-point arithmetic. Low-precision fixed-point training presents a compelling alternative. This work introduces a novel enhancement in low-precision logarithmic fixed-point training, geared towards future hardware accelerator designs. We propose incorporating bitwidth in the design of approximations to arithmetic operations. To this end, we introduce a new hardware-friendly, piece-wise linear approximation for logarithmic addition. Using simulated annealing, we optimize this approximation at different precision levels. A C++ bit-true simulation demonstrates training of VGG-11 and VGG-16 models on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, respectively, using 12-bit integer arithmetic with minimal accuracy degradation compared to 32-bit floating-point training. Our hardware study reveals up to 32.5% reduction in area and 53.5% reduction in energy consumption for the proposed LNS multiply-accumulate units compared to that of linear fixed-point equivalents.

<title>Investigating Thinking Behaviours of Reasoning-Based Language Models for Social Bias Mitigation</title>

Abstract: While reasoning-based large language models excel at complex tasks through an internal, structured thinking process, a concerning phenomenon has emerged that such a thinking process can aggregate social stereotypes, leading to biased outcomes. However, the underlying behaviours of these language models in social bias scenarios remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and uncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype repetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary justification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or introduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these insights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that queries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific failure patterns. Experiments on question answering (BBQ and StereoSet) and open-ended (BOLD) benchmarks show that our approach effectively reduces bias while maintaining or improving accuracy.

<title>Explainable Heterogeneous Anomaly Detection in Financial Networks via Adaptive Expert Routing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17088</link>

Abstract: Financial anomalies exhibit heterogeneous mechanisms (price shocks, liquidity freezes, contagion cascades, regime shifts), but existing detectors treat all anomalies uniformly, producing scalar scores without revealing which mechanism is failing, where risks concentrate, or how to intervene. This opacity prevents targeted regulatory responses. Three unsolved challenges persist: (1) static graph structures cannot adapt when market correlations shift during regime changes; (2) uniform detection mechanisms miss type-specific signatures across multiple temporal scales while failing to integrate individual behaviors with network contagion; (3) black-box outputs provide no actionable guidance on anomaly mechanisms or their temporal evolution.
  We address these via adaptive graph learning with specialized expert networks that provide built-in interpretability. Our framework captures multi-scale temporal dependencies through BiLSTM with self-attention, fuses temporal and spatial information via cross-modal attention, learns dynamic graphs through neural multi-source interpolation, adaptively balances learned dynamics with structural priors via stress-modulated fusion, routes anomalies to four mechanism-specific experts, and produces dual-level interpretable attributions. Critically, interpretability is embedded architecturally rather than applied post-hoc.
  On 100 US equities (2017-2024), we achieve 92.3% detection of 13 major events with 3.8-day lead time, outperforming best baseline by 30.8pp. Silicon Valley Bank case study demonstrates anomaly evolution tracking: Price-Shock expert weight rose to 0.39 (33% above baseline 0.29) during closure, peaking at 0.48 (66% above baseline) one week later, revealing automatic temporal mechanism identification without labeled supervision.

<title>Can Transformer Memory Be Corrupted? Investigating Cache-Side Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17098</link>

Abstract: Even when prompts and parameters are secured, transformer language models remain vulnerable because their key-value (KV) cache during inference constitutes an overlooked attack surface. This paper introduces Malicious Token Injection (MTI), a modular framework that systematically perturbs cached key vectors at selected layers and timesteps through controlled magnitude and frequency, using additive Gaussian noise, zeroing, and orthogonal rotations. A theoretical analysis quantifies how these perturbations propagate through attention, linking logit deviations to the Frobenius norm of corruption and softmax Lipschitz dynamics. Empirical results show that MTI significantly alters next-token distributions and downstream task performance across GPT-2 and LLaMA-2/7B, as well as destabilizes retrieval-augmented and agentic reasoning pipelines. These findings identify cache integrity as a critical yet underexplored vulnerability in current LLM deployments, positioning cache corruption as a reproducible and theoretically grounded threat model for future robustness and security research.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to tackle complex tasks, often necessitating collaboration among multiple specialized agents. However, multi-agent collaboration introduces new challenges in planning, coordination, and verification. Execution failures frequently arise not from flawed reasoning alone, but from subtle misalignments in task interpretation, output format, or inter-agent handoffs. To address these challenges, we present VeriMAP, a framework for multi-agent collaboration with verification-aware planning. The VeriMAP planner decomposes tasks, models subtask dependencies, and encodes planner-defined passing criteria as subtask verification functions (VFs) in Python and natural language. We evaluate VeriMAP on diverse datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms both single- and multi-agent baselines while enhancing system robustness and interpretability. Our analysis highlights how verification-aware planning enables reliable coordination and iterative refinement in multi-agent systems, without relying on external labels or annotations.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models extend vision-language models to embodied control by mapping natural-language instructions and visual observations to robot actions. Despite their capabilities, VLA systems face significant challenges due to their massive computational and memory demands, which conflict with the constraints of edge platforms such as on-board mobile manipulators that require real-time performance. Addressing this tension has become a central focus of recent research. In light of the growing efforts toward more efficient and scalable VLA systems, this survey provides a systematic review of approaches for improving VLA efficiency, with an emphasis on reducing latency, memory footprint, and training and inference costs. We categorize existing solutions into four dimensions: model architecture, perception feature, action generation, and training/inference strategies, summarizing representative techniques within each category. Finally, we discuss future trends and open challenges, highlighting directions for advancing efficient embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Language models trained with a fixed vocabulary struggle to generalize to novel or out-of-vocabulary words, limiting their flexibility in handling diverse token combinations. Existing dynamic vocabulary approaches attempt to address this limitation but face challenges such as fragmented codebases, lack of support for modern LLMs, and limited inference scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce DVAGen, a fully open-source, unified framework designed for training, evaluation, and visualization of dynamic vocabulary-augmented language models. Our framework modularizes the pipeline for ease of customization, integrates seamlessly with open-source LLMs, and is the first to provide both CLI and WebUI tools for real-time result inspection. We validate the effectiveness of dynamic vocabulary methods on modern LLMs and demonstrate support for batch inference, significantly improving inference throughput.

<title>GOOD: Training-Free Guided Diffusion Sampling for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements have explored text-to-image diffusion models for synthesizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, substantially enhancing the performance of OOD detection. However, existing approaches typically rely on perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence, this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.

<title>Do LLMs Recognize Your Latent Preferences? A Benchmark for Latent Information Discovery in Personalized Interaction</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information through conversation?
  We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction, highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for building truly adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: Generating editable, parametric CAD models from a single image holds great potential to lower the barriers of industrial concept design. However, current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective: simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone, consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity, geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.

Abstract: Large foundation models are fundamentally transforming the software engineering landscape, demonstrating exceptional capabilities across diverse tasks such as code generation, debugging, and testing. Despite this rapid progress, a significant gap remains in how to comprehensively evaluate these models' trustworthiness in real-world software engineering scenarios. Existing benchmarks suffer from limited task scope and fail to incorporate critical evaluation aspects such as the robustness and reliability of models. To bridge this gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic assessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks. Our evaluation framework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main improvements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software engineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and Multi-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language, text-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness Assessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code transformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the trustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and adaptive solution extraction. Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26 state-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance variation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate specific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit;

Abstract: Automated plankton recognition models face significant challenges during real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (Out-of-Distribution, OoD) between training and test data. This stems from plankton's complex morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset \cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM \cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale, systematic evaluation and analysis of Out-of-Distribution data detection methods in plankton recognition.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving robust and intelligent driving policies. However, existing end-to-end methods still face significant challenges, such as suboptimal decision-making in complex scenarios. In this paper,we propose SimpleVSF (Simple VLM-Scoring Fusion), a novel framework that enhances end-to-end planning by leveraging the cognitive capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and advanced trajectory fusion techniques. We utilize the conventional scorers and the novel VLM-enhanced scorers. And we leverage a robust weight fusioner for quantitative aggregation and a powerful VLM-based fusioner for qualitative, context-aware decision-making. As the leading approach in the ICCV 2025 NAVSIM v2 End-to-End Driving Challenge, our SimpleVSF framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior balance between safety, comfort, and efficiency.

Abstract: Effectively processing long contexts is a critical challenge for language models. While standard Transformers are limited by quadratic complexity and poor length extrapolation, alternative architectures like sliding window attention and state space models sacrifice the ability to effectively utilize the full context due to their fixed-size memory. Chunk-based sparse attention has emerged as a promising paradigm for extreme length generalization, yet the key architectural principles underpinning its success are not yet fully understood. In this work, we present a systematic dissection of these models to identify the core components driving their performance. Through a unified framework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination of three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk Encoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval; (2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information without it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced selection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution gap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing and landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new state-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully generalizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and BABILong. Our findings provide a clear and empirically-grounded set of design principles for developing future, highly-capable long-context language models.

Abstract: As the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advance, they can process increasingly large inputs, which, unlike in LLMs, generates significant visual token redundancy and leads to prohibitive inference costs. While many methods aim to reduce these costs by pruning visual tokens, existing approaches, whether based on attention or diversity, typically neglect the guidance of the text prompt and thus fail to prioritize task relevance. In this work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token pruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context. Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal accuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\% of the tokens. Furthermore, these gains are accompanied by significant reductions in GPU memory footprint and inference latency.

Abstract: The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and vast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing thousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now, been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful general-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted to this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset - a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of Bangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur Union, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially, this dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements that have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple color-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and then fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of riverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this destructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a Dice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional methods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key contributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in Bangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this critical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which policymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.

Abstract: Recently, research on predicting match outcomes in esports has been actively conducted, but much of it is based on match log data and statistical information. This research targets the FPS game VALORANT, which requires complex strategies, and aims to build a round outcome prediction model by analyzing minimap information in match footage. Specifically, based on the video recognition model TimeSformer, we attempt to improve prediction accuracy by incorporating detailed tactical features extracted from minimap information, such as character position information and other in-game events. This paper reports preliminary results showing that a model trained on a dataset augmented with such tactical event labels achieved approximately 81% prediction accuracy, especially from the middle phases of a round onward, significantly outperforming a model trained on a dataset with the minimap information itself. This suggests that leveraging tactical features from match footage is highly effective for predicting round outcomes in VALORANT.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential in language modeling, offering various advantages over traditional autoregressive approaches. Their ability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster generation and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based language models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively processing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask or replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards valuable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this limitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$ predicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This provides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from earlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to propagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a pretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate that continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved perplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art diffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM. SM consistently improves performance across multiple coding benchmarks, particularly in high-throughput settings.

<title>D2C-HRHR: Discrete Actions with Double Distributional Critics for High-Risk-High-Return Tasks</title>

Abstract: Tasks involving high-risk-high-return (HRHR) actions, such as obstacle crossing, often exhibit multimodal action distributions and stochastic returns. Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods assume unimodal Gaussian policies and rely on scalar-valued critics, which limits their effectiveness in HRHR settings. We formally define HRHR tasks and theoretically show that Gaussian policies cannot guarantee convergence to the optimal solution. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that (i) discretizes continuous action spaces to approximate multimodal distributions, (ii) employs entropy-regularized exploration to improve coverage of risky but rewarding actions, and (iii) introduces a dual-critic architecture for more accurate discrete value distribution estimation. The framework scales to high-dimensional action spaces, supporting complex control domains. Experiments on locomotion and manipulation benchmarks with high risks of failure demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling multimodality and risk in RL.

Abstract: Effective and accurate diagnosis of fuel cell health status is crucial for ensuring the stable operation of fuel cell stacks. Among various parameters, high-frequency impedance serves as a critical indicator for assessing fuel cell state and health conditions. However, its online testing is prohibitively complex and costly. This paper employs a deep sparse auto-encoding network for the prediction and classification of high-frequency impedance in fuel cells, achieving metric of accuracy rate above 92\%. The network is further deployed on an FPGA, attaining a hardware-based recognition rate almost 90\%.

Abstract: Existing Moment retrieval (MR) methods focus on Single-Moment Retrieval (SMR). However, one query can correspond to multiple relevant moments in real-world applications. This makes the existing datasets and methods insufficient for video temporal grounding. By revisiting the gap between current MR tasks and real-world applications, we introduce a high-quality datasets called QVHighlights Multi-Moment Dataset (QV-M$^2$), along with new evaluation metrics tailored for multi-moment retrieval (MMR). QV-M$^2$ consists of 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments. Building on existing efforts in MMR, we propose a framework called FlashMMR. Specifically, we propose a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine the moment boundaries. We introduce constrained temporal adjustment and subsequently leverage a verification module to re-evaluate the candidate segments. Through this sophisticated filtering pipeline, low-confidence proposals are pruned, and robust multi-moment alignment is achieved. We retrain and evaluate 6 existing MR methods on QV-M$^2$ and QVHighlights under both SMR and MMR settings. Results show that QV-M$^2$ serves as an effective benchmark for training and evaluating MMR models, while FlashMMR provides a strong baseline. Specifically, on QV-M$^2$, it achieves improvements over prior SOTA method by 3.00% on G-mAP, 2.70% on mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% on mR@3. The proposed benchmark and method establish a foundation for advancing research in more realistic and challenging video temporal grounding scenarios. Code is released at https://github.com/Zhuo-Cao/QV-M2.

Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made in multi-modal continual learning, aiming to learn new tasks sequentially in multi-modal settings while preserving performance on previously learned ones. However, existing methods mainly focus on coarse-grained tasks, with limitations in addressing modality entanglement in fine-grained continual learning settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel Continual Audio-Visual Segmentation (CAVS) task, aiming to continuously segment new classes guided by audio. Through comprehensive analysis, two critical challenges are identified: 1) multi-modal semantic drift, where a sounding objects is labeled as background in sequential tasks; 2) co-occurrence confusion, where frequent co-occurring classes tend to be confused. In this work, a Collision-based Multi-modal Rehearsal (CMR) framework is designed to address these challenges. Specifically, for multi-modal semantic drift, a Multi-modal Sample Selection (MSS) strategy is proposed to select samples with high modal consistency for rehearsal. Meanwhile, for co-occurence confusion, a Collision-based Sample Rehearsal (CSR) mechanism is designed, allowing for the increase of rehearsal sample frequency of those confusable classes during training process. Moreover, we construct three audio-visual incremental scenarios to verify effectiveness of our method. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms single-modal continual learning methods.

<title>Visibility Allocation Systems: How Algorithmic Design Shapes Online Visibility and Societal Outcomes</title>

Abstract: Throughout application domains, we now rely extensively on algorithmic systems to engage with ever-expanding datasets of information. Despite their benefits, these systems are often complex (comprising of many intricate tools, e.g., moderation, recommender systems, prediction models), of unknown structure (due to the lack of accompanying documentation), and having hard-to-predict yet potentially severe downstream consequences (due to the extensive use, systematic enactment of existing errors, and many comprising feedback loops). As such, understanding and evaluating these systems as a whole remains a challenge for both researchers and legislators. To aid ongoing efforts, we introduce a formal framework for such visibility allocation systems (VASs) which we define as (semi-)automated systems deciding which (processed) data to present a human user with. We review typical tools comprising VASs and define the associated computational problems they solve. By doing so, VASs can be decomposed into sub-processes and illustrated via data flow diagrams. Moreover, we survey metrics for evaluating VASs throughout the pipeline, thus aiding system diagnostics. Using forecasting-based recommendations in school choice as a case study, we demonstrate how our framework can support VAS evaluation. We also discuss how our framework can support ongoing AI-legislative efforts to locate obligations, quantify systemic risks, and enable adaptive compliance.

<title>How News Feels: Understanding Affective Bias in Multilingual Headlines for Human-Centered Media Design</title>

Abstract: News media often shape the public mood not only by what they report but by how they frame it. The same event can appear calm in one outlet and alarming in another, reflecting subtle emotional bias in reporting. Negative or emotionally charged headlines tend to attract more attention and spread faster, which in turn encourages outlets to frame stories in ways that provoke stronger reactions. This research explores that tendency through large-scale emotion analysis of Bengali news. Using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B, we analyzed 300000 Bengali news headlines and their content to identify the dominant emotion and overall tone of each. The findings reveal a clear dominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment, and significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed across outlets. Based on these insights, we propose design ideas for a human-centered news aggregator that visualizes emotional cues and helps readers recognize hidden affective framing in daily news.

Abstract: Understanding user behavior on the web is increasingly critical for optimizing user experience (UX). This study introduces Augmented Web Usage Mining (AWUM), a methodology designed to enhance web usage mining and improve UX by enriching the interaction data provided by CAWAL (Combined Application Log and Web Analytics), a framework for advanced web analytics. Over 1.2 million session records collected in one month (~8.5GB of data) were processed and transformed into enriched datasets. AWUM analyzes session structures, page requests, service interactions, and exit methods. Results show that 87.16% of sessions involved multiple pages, contributing 98.05% of total pageviews; 40% of users accessed various services and 50% opted for secure exits. Association rule mining revealed patterns of frequently accessed services, highlighting CAWAL's precision and efficiency over conventional methods. AWUM offers a comprehensive understanding of user behavior and strong potential for large-scale UX optimization.

Abstract: The advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by a fragmented landscape of inconsistent and contaminated public datasets. We introduce FineVision, a meticulously collected, curated, and unified corpus of 24 million samples - the largest open resource of its kind. We unify more than 200 sources into 185 subsets via a semi-automated, human-in-the-loop pipeline: automation performs bulk ingestion and schema mapping, while reviewers audit mappings and spot-check outputs to verify faithful consumption of annotations, appropriate formatting and diversity, and safety; issues trigger targeted fixes and re-runs. The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity. Models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on existing open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, underscoring the benefits of scale, data hygiene, and balanced automation with human oversight. We release the corpus and curation tools to accelerate data-centric VLM research.

Abstract: Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice, constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data captures complex dynamics across both space and time, yet traditional visualizations are complex, require domain expertise and often fail to resonate with broader audiences. Here, we propose MapMuse, a storytelling-based framework for interpreting spatio-temporal datasets, transforming them into compelling, narrative-driven experiences. We utilize large language models and employ retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based techniques to generate comprehensive stories. Drawing on principles common in cinematic storytelling, we emphasize clarity, emotional connection, and audience-centric design. As a case study, we analyze a dataset of taxi trajectories. Two perspectives are presented: a captivating story based on a heat map that visualizes millions of taxi trip endpoints to uncover urban mobility patterns; and a detailed narrative following a single long taxi journey, enriched with city landmarks and temporal shifts. By portraying locations as characters and movement as plot, we argue that data storytelling drives insight, engagement, and action from spatio-temporal information. The case study illustrates how MapMuse can bridge the gap between data complexity and human understanding. The aim of this short paper is to provide a glimpse to the potential of the cinematic storytelling technique as an effective communication tool for spatio-temporal data, as well as to describe open problems and opportunities for future research.

<title>Auto-Rubric: Learning to Extract Generalizable Criteria for Reward Modeling</title>

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values, yet their development is hampered by costly preference datasets and poor interpretability. While recent rubric-based approaches offer transparency, they often lack systematic quality control and optimization, creating a trade-off between scalability and reliability. We address these limitations with a novel, training-free framework built on a key assumption: \textit{evaluation rubrics underlying human preferences exhibit significant generalization ability across diverse queries}, a property that enables remarkable data efficiency. Our two-stage approach first infers high-quality, query-specific rubrics using a validation-guided \textbf{Propose-Evaluate-Revise} pipeline. Second, it generalizes these granular rubrics into a compact, non-redundant core set by maximizing an \textbf{information-theoretic coding rate}. The final output is an interpretable, hierarchical "Theme-Tips" rubric set. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's exceptional data efficiency and performance. Critically, using just 70 preference pairs (1.5\% of the source data), our method also empowers smaller models like Qwen3-8B to outperform specialized, fully-trained counterparts. This work pioneers a scalable, interpretable, and data-efficient path for reward modeling.

Abstract: The significance of license plate image restoration goes beyond the preprocessing stage of License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems, as it also serves various purposes, including increasing evidential value, enhancing the clarity of visual interface, and facilitating further utilization of license plate images. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and recognition in practical deployment scenarios.

<title>DDSC: Dynamic Dual-Signal Curriculum for Data-Efficient Acoustic Scene Classification under Domain Shift</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Acoustic scene classification (ASC) suffers from device-induced domain shift, especially when labels are limited. Prior work focuses on curriculum-based training schedules that structure data presentation by ordering or reweighting training examples from easy-to-hard to facilitate learning; however, existing curricula are static, fixing the ordering or the weights before training and ignoring that example difficulty and marginal utility evolve with the learned representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Dynamic Dual-Signal Curriculum (DDSC), a training schedule that adapts the curriculum online by combining two signals computed each epoch: a domain-invariance signal and a learning-progress signal. A time-varying scheduler fuses these signals into per-example weights that prioritize domain-invariant examples in early epochs and progressively emphasize device-specific cases. DDSC is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and introduces no additional inference overhead. Under the official DCASE 2024 Task~1 protocol, DDSC consistently improves cross-device performance across diverse ASC baselines and label budgets, with the largest gains on unseen-device splits.

Abstract: Deep learning approaches for heart-sound (PCG) segmentation built on time--frequency features can be accurate but often rely on large expert-labeled datasets, limiting robustness and deployment. We present TopSeg, a topological representation-centric framework that encodes PCG dynamics with multi-scale topological features and decodes them using a lightweight temporal convolutional network (TCN) with an order- and duration-constrained inference step. To evaluate data efficiency and generalization, we train exclusively on PhysioNet 2016 dataset with subject-level subsampling and perform external validation on CirCor dataset. Under matched-capacity decoders, the topological features consistently outperform spectrogram and envelope inputs, with the largest margins at low data budgets; as a full system, TopSeg surpasses representative end-to-end baselines trained on their native inputs under the same budgets while remaining competitive at full data. Ablations at 10% training confirm that all scales contribute and that combining H_0 and H_1 yields more reliable S1/S2 localization and boundary stability. These results indicate that topology-aware representations provide a strong inductive bias for data-efficient, cross-dataset PCG segmentation, supporting practical use when labeled data are limited.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from an external corpus. However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text documents, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and documents may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this paper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to improve vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified mixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate the scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated pipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct NyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that better reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality dataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform pre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets, followed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream vision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs competitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more general and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality in vision-language tasks.

arXiv:2510.17358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable, efficient) encodings. The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both training and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic blocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at initialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends capacity allocation to entire specialized LLMs, enabling multi-granularity architectural adaptation. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule injection, and principled recruitment  criteria based on penalized likelihood with explicit units. We provide rigorous mathematical results establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism provides convergence guarantees at both the block level (fine-grained, within-LLM) and the LLM level (coarse-grained, cross-domain), ensuring the system discovers semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data encoding efficiency. This framework enables practitioners to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

Abstract: Robotic systems are increasingly expected to operate in human-centered, unstructured environments where safety, adaptability, and generalization are essential. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have been proposed as a language guided generalized control framework for real robots. However, their deployment has been limited to conventional serial link manipulators. Coupled by their rigidity and unpredictability of learning based control, the ability to safely interact with the environment is missing yet critical. In this work, we present the deployment of a VLA model on a soft continuum manipulator to demonstrate autonomous safe human-robot interaction. We present a structured finetuning and deployment pipeline evaluating two state-of-the-art VLA models (OpenVLA-OFT and $\pi_0$) across representative manipulation tasks, and show while out-of-the-box policies fail due to embodiment mismatch, through targeted finetuning the soft robot performs equally to the rigid counterpart. Our findings highlight the necessity of finetuning for bridging embodiment gaps, and demonstrate that coupling VLA models with soft robots enables safe and flexible embodied AI in human-shared environments.

Abstract: Optimizing the energy management within a smart grids scenario presents significant challenges, primarily due to the complexity of real-world systems and the intricate interactions among various components. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is gaining prominence as a solution for addressing the challenges of Optimal Power Flow in smart grids. However, RL needs to iterate compulsively throughout a given environment to obtain the optimal policy. This means obtaining samples from a, most likely, costly simulator, which can lead to a sample efficiency problem. In this work, we address this problem by substituting costly smart grid simulators with surrogate models built using Phisics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs), optimizing the RL policy training process by arriving to convergent results in a fraction of the time employed by the original environment.

Abstract: Tabular prediction has traditionally relied on gradient-boosted decision trees and specialized deep learning models, which excel within tasks but provide limited interpretability and weak transfer across tables. Reasoning large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1 approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting. Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).

Abstract: Traditional approaches to inference of deterministic finite-state automata (DFA) stem from symbolic AI, including both active learning methods (e.g., Angluin's L* algorithm and its variants) and passive techniques (e.g., Biermann and Feldman's method, RPNI). Meanwhile, sub-symbolic AI, particularly machine learning, offers alternative paradigms for learning from data, such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning (RL). This paper investigates the use of Q-learning, a well-known reinforcement learning algorithm, for the passive inference of deterministic finite automata. It builds on the core insight that the learned Q-function, which maps state-action pairs to rewards, can be reinterpreted as the transition function of a DFA over a finite domain. This provides a novel bridge between sub-symbolic learning and symbolic representations. The paper demonstrates how Q-learning can be adapted for automaton inference and provides an evaluation on several examples.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming education by answering questions, explaining complex concepts, and generating content across a wide range of subjects. Despite strong performance on academic benchmarks, they often fail to tailor responses to students' grade levels. This is a critical need in K-12 education, where age-appropriate vocabulary and explanation are essential for effective learning. Existing models frequently produce outputs that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects, spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for early-grade students (Grades 1-5). Our work presents the first dataset and evaluation framework for assessing grade-level adaptability in LLMs, aiming to foster more developmentally aligned educational AI systems through better training and prompting strategies. EduAdapt code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/NaumanNaeem/EduAdapt.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) presents a rich and structurally unique knowledge system that challenges conventional applications of large language models (LLMs). Although previous TCM-specific LLMs have shown progress through supervised fine-tuning, they often face limitations in alignment, data quality, and evaluation consistency. In this study, we introduce Ladder-base, the first TCM-focused LLM trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that improves reasoning and factual consistency by optimizing response selection based on intra-group comparisons. Ladder-base is built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model and trained exclusively on the textual subset of the TCM-Ladder benchmark, using 80 percent of the data for training and the remaining 20 percent split evenly between validation and test sets. Through standardized evaluation, Ladder-base demonstrates superior performance across multiple reasoning metrics when compared to both state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, and Qwen3 and domain-specific TCM models including BenTsao, HuatuoGPT2, and Zhongjing. These findings suggest that GRPO provides an effective and efficient strategy for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in traditional medical domains and supports the development of trustworthy and clinically grounded TCM artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: Multimodal AI research has overwhelmingly focused on high-resource languages, hindering the democratization of advancements in the field. To address this, we present AfriCaption, a comprehensive framework for multilingual image captioning in 20 African languages and our contributions are threefold: (i) a curated dataset built on Flickr8k, featuring semantically aligned captions generated via a context-aware selection and translation process; (ii) a dynamic, context-preserving pipeline that ensures ongoing quality through model ensembling and adaptive substitution; and (iii) the AfriCaption model, a 0.5B parameter vision-to-text architecture that integrates SigLIP and NLLB200 for caption generation across under-represented languages. This unified framework ensures ongoing data quality and establishes the first scalable image-captioning resource for under-represented African languages, laying the groundwork for truly inclusive multimodal AI.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two millennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM, integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics, herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000 users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for real-world deployment.

<title>Navigating the Alignment-Calibration Trade-off: A Pareto-Superior Frontier via Model Merging</title>

Abstract: The "alignment tax" of post-training is typically framed as a drop in task accuracy. We show it also involves a severe loss of calibration, making models overconfident, less reliable, and model outputs less diverse. We show that this trade-off can be navigated effectively via a simple post-hoc intervention: interpolating between a model's weights before and after alignment. Crucially, this is not a strict trade-off. We find that the process consistently reveals Pareto-optimal interpolations - models that improve accuracy beyond both parents while substantially recovering the calibration lost during alignment. Our work demonstrates that simple model merging provides a computationally efficient method for mitigating the full scope of the alignment tax, yielding models that are more capable and more reliable.

<title>From Spatial to Actions: Grounding Vision-Language-Action Model in Spatial Foundation Priors</title>

Abstract: Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models act in 3D real-world but are typically built on 2D encoders, leaving a spatial reasoning gap that limits generalization and adaptability. Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone. These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.

<title>The Parameterized Complexity of Computing the VC-Dimension</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17451</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The VC-dimension is a fundamental and well-studied measure of the complexity of a set system (or hypergraph) that is central to many areas of machine learning. We establish several new results on the complexity of computing the VC-dimension. In particular, given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$, we prove that the naive $2^{\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{V}|)}$-time algorithm is asymptotically tight under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). We then prove that the problem admits a 1-additive fixed-parameter approximation algorithm when parameterized by the maximum degree of $\mathcal{H}$ and a fixed-parameter algorithm when parameterized by its dimension, and that these are essentially the only such exploitable structural parameters. Lastly, we consider a generalization of the problem, formulated using graphs, which captures the VC-dimension of both set systems and graphs. We show that it is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the treewidth of the graph (which, in the case of set systems, applies to the treewidth of its incidence graph). In contrast with closely related problems whose dependency on the treewidth is necessarily double-exponential (assuming the ETH), our algorithm has a relatively low dependency on the treewidth.

<title>Layer Specialization Underlying Compositional Reasoning in Transformers</title>

Abstract: Transformers exhibit compositional reasoning on sequences not observed during training, a capability often attributed to in-context learning (ICL) and skill composition. We investigate this phenomenon using the Random Hierarchy Model (RHM), a probabilistic context-free grammar that generates sequences through recursive rule application. Models are trained on subsets of sequences and evaluated across four generalization conditions: memorization, in-distribution generalization, out-of-distribution generalization with the same rules, and cross-layer transfer. Behaviorally, performance improves systematically with task complexity and the number of in-context examples, with out-of-distribution tasks requiring substantially more examples than in-distribution scenarios. Mechanistically, we identify a progressive emergence of layer specialization during training that correlates with generalization performance. Principal component analysis and attention pattern clustering reveal that transformers develop structured, hierarchically organized representations in specialized layers. These results demonstrate that transformers develop modular, interpretable mechanisms supporting compositional reasoning, linking internal algorithmic structure to observed behavioral capabilities.

<title>DAMSDAN: Distribution-Aware Multi-Source Domain Adaptation Network for Cross-Domain EEG-based Emotion Recognition</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Significant inter-individual variability limits the generalization of EEG-based emotion recognition under cross-domain settings. We address two core challenges in multi-source adaptation: (1) dynamically modeling distributional heterogeneity across sources and quantifying their relevance to a target to reduce negative transfer; and (2) achieving fine-grained semantic consistency to strengthen class discrimination. We propose a distribution-aware multi-source domain adaptation network (DAMSDAN). DAMSDAN integrates prototype-based constraints with adversarial learning to drive the encoder toward discriminative, domain-invariant emotion representations. A domain-aware source weighting strategy based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) dynamically estimates inter-domain shifts and reweights source contributions. In addition, a prototype-guided conditional alignment module with dual pseudo-label interaction enhances pseudo-label reliability and enables category-level, fine-grained alignment, mitigating noise propagation and semantic drift. Experiments on SEED and SEED-IV show average accuracies of 94.86\% and 79.78\% for cross-subject, and 95.12\% and 83.15\% for cross-session protocols. On the large-scale FACED dataset, DAMSDAN achieves 82.88\% (cross-subject). Extensive ablations and interpretability analyses corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for cross-domain EEG-based emotion recognition.

<title>SparseWorld: A Flexible, Adaptive, and Efficient 4D Occupancy World Model Powered by Sparse and Dynamic Queries</title>

Abstract: Semantic occupancy has emerged as a powerful representation in world models for its ability to capture rich spatial semantics. However, most existing occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place classification" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic and continuous nature of real scenarios.In this paper, we propose SparseWorld, a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient, powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning tasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the advantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/MSunDYY/SparseWorld.

Abstract: We introduce I-RAVEN-X, a symbolic benchmark designed to evaluate generalization and robustness in analogical and mathematical reasoning for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). I-RAVEN-X extends I-RAVEN by increasing operand complexity, attribute range, and introducing perceptual uncertainty. Compared to LLMs, empirical results show that LRMs achieve improved productivity and systematicity on longer reasoning relations and wider attribute ranges, respectively. However, LRMs are still significantly challenged by reasoning under uncertainty and cannot effectively explore multiple probabilistic outcomes.

<title>Context-Aware Pseudo-Label Scoring for Zero-Shot Video Summarization</title>

arXiv:2510.17501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of video content across social media, surveillance, and education platforms, efficiently summarizing long videos into concise yet semantically faithful surrogates has become increasingly vital. Existing supervised methods achieve strong in-domain accuracy by learning from dense annotations but suffer from high labeling costs and limited cross-dataset generalization, while unsupervised approaches, though label-free, often fail to capture high-level human semantics and fine-grained narrative cues. More recently, zero-shot prompting pipelines have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for training-free video summarization, yet remain highly sensitive to handcrafted prompt templates and dataset-specific score normalization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled prompting framework that transforms a small subset of ground-truth annotations into high-confidence pseudo labels, which are aggregated into structured, dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics guiding interpretable scene evaluation. During inference, first and last segments are scored based solely on their descriptions, whereas intermediate ones incorporate brief contextual summaries of adjacent scenes to assess narrative progression and redundancy. This contextual prompting enables the LLM to balance local salience and global coherence without parameter tuning. On SumMe and TVSum, our method achieves F1 scores of \textbf{57.58} and \textbf{63.05}, surpassing unsupervised and prior zero-shot baselines while approaching supervised performance. The results demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling effectively stabilizes LLM-based scoring and establishes a general, interpretable zero-shot paradigm for video summarization.

Abstract: Sparse neural networks promise efficiency, yet training them effectively remains a fundamental challenge. Despite advances in pruning methods that create sparse architectures, understanding why some sparse structures are better trainable than others with the same level of sparsity remains poorly understood. Aiming to develop a systematic approach to this fundamental problem, we propose a novel theoretical framework based on the theory of graph limits, particularly graphons, that characterizes sparse neural networks in the infinite-width regime. Our key insight is that connectivity patterns of sparse neural networks induced by pruning methods converge to specific graphons as networks' width tends to infinity, which encodes implicit structural biases of different pruning methods. We postulate the Graphon Limit Hypothesis and provide empirical evidence to support it. Leveraging this graphon representation, we derive a Graphon Neural Tangent Kernel (Graphon NTK) to study the training dynamics of sparse networks in the infinite width limit. Graphon NTK provides a general framework for the theoretical analysis of sparse networks. We empirically show that the spectral analysis of Graphon NTK correlates with observed training dynamics of sparse networks, explaining the varying convergence behaviours of different pruning methods. Our framework provides theoretical insights into the impact of connectivity patterns on the trainability of various sparse network architectures.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented, based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale, standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off: instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content (\textit{e.g.,} images, videos, and 3D objects/scenes) have made remarkable progress. However, training large-scale video generation models remains particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii) training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations. More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights, Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node scaling, details are available in \href{https://github.com/Shopee-MUG/MUG-V}{our webpage}.

Abstract: Active Surveillance (AS) is a treatment option for managing low and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), aiming to avoid overtreatment while monitoring disease progression through serial MRI and clinical follow-up. Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However, existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module, which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert annotations. MambaX-Net was evaluated on a longitudinal AS dataset, and results showed that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even when trained on limited and noisy data.

Abstract: In safety-critical domains such as robotics, navigation and power systems, constrained optimization problems arise where maximizing performance must be carefully balanced with associated constraints. Safe reinforcement learning provides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being a popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially depends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$, which governs the trade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update the multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in practice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an automated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we analyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe reinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\lambda$-profiles that give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and constraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly sensitive nature of $\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general intuition for choosing the optimal value $\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally show that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even exceed the optimal performance found at $\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference in their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier updates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated through PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to achieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need for further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement learning. The code used to reproduce our results can be found at https://github.com/lindsayspoor/Lagrangian_SafeRL.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of planning complex manipulation tasks, in which multiple robots with different end-effectors and capabilities, informed by computer vision, must plan and execute concatenated sequences of actions on a variety of objects that can appear in arbitrary positions and configurations in unstructured scenes. We propose an intent-driven planning pipeline which can robustly construct such action sequences with varying degrees of supervisory input from a human using simple language instructions. The pipeline integrates: (i) perception-to-text scene encoding, (ii) an ensemble of large language models (LLMs) that generate candidate removal sequences based on the operator's intent, (iii) an LLM-based verifier that enforces formatting and precedence constraints, and (iv) a deterministic consistency filter that rejects hallucinated objects. The pipeline is evaluated on an example task in which two robot arms work collaboratively to dismantle an Electric Vehicle battery for recycling applications. A variety of components must be grasped and removed in specific sequences, determined by human instructions and/or by task-order feasibility decisions made by the autonomous system. On 200 real scenes with 600 operator prompts across five component classes, we used metrics of full-sequence correctness and next-task correctness to evaluate and compare five LLM-based planners (including ablation analyses of pipeline components). We also evaluated the LLM-based human interface in terms of time to execution and NASA TLX with human participant experiments. Results indicate that our ensemble-with-verification approach reliably maps operator intent to safe, executable multi-robot plans while maintaining low user effort.

Abstract: Multi-pulse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely utilized for clinical practice such as Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. To train a robust model for multi-pulse MRI classification, it requires large and diverse data from various medical institutions while protecting privacy by preventing raw data sharing across institutions. Although federated learning (FL) is a feasible solution to address this issue, it poses challenges of model convergence due to the effect of data heterogeneity and substantial communication overhead due to large numbers of parameters transmitted within the model. To address these challenges, we propose CEPerFed, a communication-efficient personalized FL method. It mitigates the effect of data heterogeneity by incorporating client-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to coordinate local and global optimization. The former is used to weight the contributions from other clients, enhancing the reliability of local updates, while the latter enforces consistency between local updates and the global optimization direction to ensure stable convergence across heterogeneous data distributions. To address the high communication overhead, we propose a hierarchical SVD (HSVD) strategy that transmits only the most critical information required for model updates. Experiments on five classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CEPerFed method. The code will be released upon acceptance at https://github.com/LD0416/CEPerFed.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are increasingly being applied to code-related tasks. Although PLMs have achieved good results, they do not take into account potential high-order data correlations within the code. We propose three types of high-order correlations in code tokens, i.e. abstract syntax tree family correlation, lexical correlation, and line correlation. We design a tokens and hyperedges generator to capture these high-order data correlations. We improve the architecture of hypergraph neural networks and combine it with adapter tuning to propose a novel hypergraph-based adapter (HGAdapter) to fine-tune PLMs. HGAdapter can encode high-order data correlations and is allowed to be inserted into various PLMs to enhance performance. Experiments were conducted on several public datasets, including six languages of code summarization and code clone detection tasks. Our methods improved the performance of PLMs in datasets to varying degrees. Experimental results validate the introduction of high-order data correlations that contribute to improved effectiveness.

<title>GUIDE: Enhancing Gradient Inversion Attacks in Federated Learning with Denoising Models</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Machine Learning (ML) models across multiple clients while preserving their privacy. Rather than sharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train the global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy guarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy leakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the training data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to reconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using optimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually reconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be enhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update Inversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion models as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE can be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely adopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach in two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets. Our results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe- art GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple metrics. Specifically, GUIDE achieves up to 46% higher perceptual similarity, as measured by the DreamSim metric.

Abstract: AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time (CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models, a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023), supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging, evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies: time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs. CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained visual recognition and generation.

<title>RESample: A Robust Data Augmentation Framework via Exploratory Sampling for Robotic Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex robotic manipulation tasks through imitation learning. However, existing imitation learning datasets contain only successful trajectories and lack failure or recovery data, especially for out-of-distribution (OOD) states where the robot deviates from the main policy due to minor perturbations or errors, leading VLA models to struggle with states deviating from the training distribution. To this end, we propose an automated OOD data augmentation framework named RESample through exploratory sampling. Specifically, we first leverage offline reinforcement learning to obtain an action-value network that accurately identifies sub-optimal actions under the current manipulation policy. We further sample potential OOD states from trajectories via rollout, and design an exploratory sampling mechanism that adaptively incorporates these action proxies into the training dataset to ensure efficiency. Subsequently, our framework explicitly encourages the VLAs to recover from OOD states and enhances their robustness against distributional shifts. We conduct extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark as well as real-world robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating that RESample consistently improves the stability and generalization ability of VLA models.

<title>Frugal Federated Learning for Violence Detection: A Comparison of LoRA-Tuned VLMs and Personalized CNNs</title>

Abstract: We examine frugal federated learning approaches to violence detection by comparing two complementary strategies: (i) zero-shot and federated fine-tuning of vision-language models (VLMs), and (ii) personalized training of a compact 3D convolutional neural network (CNN3D). Using LLaVA-7B and a 65.8M parameter CNN3D as representative cases, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and energy usage under realistic non-IID settings.
  Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy. CNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and log loss, while using less energy. VLMs remain favorable for contextual reasoning and multimodal inference. We quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions across training and inference, and analyze sustainability trade-offs for deployment.
  To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned vision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection, with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics.
  These findings support a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine classification, with selective VLM activation for complex or descriptive scenarios. The resulting framework offers a reproducible baseline for responsible, resource-aware AI in video surveillance, with extensions toward real-time, multimodal, and lifecycle-aware systems.

<title>On-the-Fly OVD Adaptation with FLAME: Few-shot Localization via Active Marginal-Samples Exploration</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17670</link>

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by detecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot performance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often compromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical downstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish between fine-grained classes such as "fishing boat" and "yacht" since their embeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user goals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections. To address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad generalization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot classifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate high-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high precision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of user-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery annotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning strategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME identifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision boundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample diversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without costly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then a minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks, establishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting foundation models to specific user needs.

Abstract: For many real-world applications, feedback is essential in translating complex, nuanced, or subjective goals into quantifiable optimization objectives. We propose a language-in-the-loop framework that uses a large language model (LLM) to convert unstructured feedback in the form of natural language into scalar utilities to conduct BO over a numeric search space. Unlike preferential BO, which only accepts restricted feedback formats and requires customized models for each domain-specific problem, our approach leverages LLMs to turn varied types of textual feedback into consistent utility signals and to easily include flexible user priors without manual kernel design. At the same time, our method maintains the sample efficiency and principled uncertainty quantification of BO. We show that this hybrid method not only provides a more natural interface to the decision maker but also outperforms conventional BO baselines and LLM-only optimizers, particularly in feedback-limited regimes.

<title>PICABench: How Far Are We from Physically Realistic Image Editing?</title>

Abstract: Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment, how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions. Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive content editing toward physically consistent realism.

Abstract: Foundation models for medical image segmentation have achieved remarkable performance. Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts. Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-image person retrieval (TIPR) aims to identify the target person using textual descriptions, facing challenge in modality heterogeneity. Prior works have attempted to address it by developing cross-modal global or local alignment strategies. However, global methods typically overlook fine-grained cross-modal differences, whereas local methods require prior information to explore explicit part alignments. Additionally, current methods are English-centric, restricting their application in multilingual contexts. To alleviate these issues, we pioneer a multilingual TIPR task by developing a multilingual TIPR benchmark, for which we leverage large language models for initial translations and refine them by integrating domain-specific knowledge. Correspondingly, we propose Bi-IRRA: a Bidirectional Implicit Relation Reasoning and Aligning framework to learn alignment across languages and modalities. Within Bi-IRRA, a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module enables bidirectional prediction of masked image and text, implicitly enhancing the modeling of local relations across languages and modalities, a multi-dimensional global alignment module is integrated to bridge the modality heterogeneity. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all multilingual TIPR datasets. Data and code are presented in https://github.com/Flame-Chasers/Bi-IRRA.

<title>CrossGuard: Safeguarding MLLMs against Joint-Modal Implicit Malicious Attacks</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong reasoning and perception capabilities but are increasingly vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While existing work focuses on explicit attacks, where malicious content resides in a single modality, recent studies reveal implicit attacks, in which benign text and image inputs jointly express unsafe intent. Such joint-modal threats are difficult to detect and remain underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of high-quality implicit data. We propose ImpForge, an automated red-teaming pipeline that leverages reinforcement learning with tailored reward modules to generate diverse implicit samples across 14 domains. Building on this dataset, we further develop CrossGuard, an intent-aware safeguard providing robust and comprehensive defense against both explicit and implicit threats. Extensive experiments across safe and unsafe benchmarks, implicit and explicit attacks, and multiple out-of-domain settings demonstrate that CrossGuard significantly outperforms existing defenses, including advanced MLLMs and guardrails, achieving stronger security while maintaining high utility. This offers a balanced and practical solution for enhancing MLLM robustness against real-world multimodal threats.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1% of people over the age of 60, causing motor impairments that impede hand coordination activities such as writing and drawing. Many approaches have tried to support early detection of Parkinson's disease based on hand-drawn images; however, we identified two major limitations in the related works: (1) the lack of sufficient datasets, (2) the robustness when dealing with unseen patient data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect Parkinson's disease that consists of two stages: The first stage classifies based on their drawing type(circle, meander, spiral), and the second stage extracts the required features from the images and detects Parkinson's disease. We overcame the previous two limitations by applying a chunking strategy where we divide each image into 2x2 chunks. Each chunk is processed separately when extracting features and recognizing Parkinson's disease indicators. To make the final classification, an ensemble method is used to merge the decisions made from each chunk. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the top performing state-of-the-art approaches, in particular on unseen patients. On the NewHandPD dataset our approach, it achieved 97.08% accuracy for seen patients and 94.91% for unseen patients, our proposed approach maintained a gap of only 2.17 percentage points, compared to the 4.76-point drop observed in prior work.

Abstract: Sim2Real aims at training policies in high-fidelity simulation environments and effectively transferring them to the real world. Despite the developments of accurate simulators and Sim2Real RL approaches, the policies trained purely in simulation often suffer significant performance drops when deployed in real environments. This drop is referred to as the Sim2Real performance gap. Current Sim2Real RL methods optimize the simulator accuracy and variability as proxies for real-world performance. However, these metrics do not necessarily correlate with the real-world performance of the policy as established theoretically and empirically in the literature. We propose a novel framework to address this issue by directly adapting the simulator parameters based on real-world performance. We frame this problem as a bi-level RL framework: the inner-level RL trains a policy purely in simulation, and the outer-level RL adapts the simulation model and in-sim reward parameters to maximize real-world performance of the in-sim policy. We derive and validate in simple examples the mathematical tools needed to develop bi-level RL algorithms that close the Sim2Real performance gap.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task that requires substantial annotated data, making it challenging in low-resource scenarios where label acquisition is expensive. While zero-shot and instruction-tuned approaches have made progress, they often fail to generalize to domain-specific entities and do not effectively utilize limited available data. We present a lightweight few-shot NER framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a new instruction tuning template with a simplified output format that combines principles from prior IT approaches to leverage the large context window of recent state-of-the-art LLMs; (2) introducing a strategic data augmentation technique that preserves entity information while paraphrasing the surrounding context, thereby expanding our training data without compromising semantic relationships. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models on few-shot and zero-shot tasks, with our few-shot approach attaining an average F1 score of 80.1 on the CrossNER datasets. Models trained with our paraphrasing approach show consistent improvements in F1 scores of up to 17 points over baseline versions, offering a promising solution for groups with limited NER training data and compute power.

Abstract: The recent development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced AI's ability to understand visual modalities. However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT-Video-Bench, a holistic video understanding benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-turn dialogues. Specifically, our MT-Video-Bench mainly assesses six core competencies that focus on perceptivity and interactivity, encompassing 987 meticulously curated multi-turn dialogues from diverse domains. These capabilities are rigorously aligned with real-world applications, such as interactive sports analysis and multi-turn video-based intelligent tutoring. With MT-Video-Bench, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in handling multi-turn video dialogues. The benchmark will be publicly available to foster future research.

Abstract: Automated signature verification is a critical biometric technique used in banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation. Despite the notable progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward robust, cross-domain signature verification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance in long-context understanding. However, current long-context LLM benchmarks are limited by rigid context length, labor-intensive annotation, and the pressing challenge of label leakage issues during LLM training. Therefore, we propose \textsc{AcademicEval}, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs over long-context generation tasks. \textsc{AcademicEval} adopts papers on arXiv to introduce several academic writing tasks with long-context inputs, \textit{i.e.}, \textsc{Title}, \textsc{Abstract}, \textsc{Introduction}, and \textsc{Related Work}, which cover a wide range of abstraction levels and require no manual labeling. Moreover, \textsc{AcademicEval} integrates high-quality and expert-curated few-shot demonstrations from a collected co-author graph to enable flexible context length. Especially, \textsc{AcademicEval} features an efficient live evaluation, ensuring no label leakage. We conduct a holistic evaluation on \textsc{AcademicEval}, and the results illustrate that LLMs perform poorly on tasks with hierarchical abstraction levels and tend to struggle with long few-shot demonstrations, highlighting the challenge of our benchmark. Through experimental analysis, we also reveal some insights for enhancing LLMs' long-context modeling capabilities. Code is available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/AcademicEval

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have sparse, event driven processing that can leverage neuromorphic applications. In this work, we introduce a multi-threading kernel that enables neuromorphic applications running at the edge, meaning they process sensory input directly and without any up-link to or dependency on a cloud service. The kernel shows speed-up gains over single thread processing by a factor of four on moderately sized SNNs and 1.7X on a Synfire network. Furthermore, it load-balances all cores available on multi-core processors, such as ARM, which run today's mobile devices and is up to 70% more energy efficient compared to statical core assignment. The present work can enable the development of edge applications that have low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP), and can prototype the integration of neuromorphic chips.

Abstract: As stories of human-AI interactions continue to be highlighted in the news and research platforms, the challenges are becoming more pronounced, including potential risks of overreliance, cognitive offloading, social and emotional manipulation, and the nuanced degradation of human agency and judgment. This paper surveys recent research on these issues through the lens of the psychological triad: cognition, behavior, and emotion. Observations seem to suggest that while AI can substantially enhance memory, creativity, and engagement, it also introduces risks such as diminished critical thinking, skill erosion, and increased anxiety. Emotional outcomes are similarly mixed, with AI systems showing promise for support and stress reduction, but raising concerns about dependency, inappropriate attachments, and ethical oversight. This paper aims to underscore the need for responsible and context-aware AI design, highlighting gaps for longitudinal research and grounded evaluation frameworks to balance benefits with emerging human-centric risks.

<title>Prediction of Sea Ice Velocity and Concentration in the Arctic Ocean using Physics-informed Neural Network</title>

Abstract: As an increasing amount of remote sensing data becomes available in the Arctic Ocean, data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques are becoming widely used to predict sea ice velocity (SIV) and sea ice concentration (SIC). However, fully data-driven ML models have limitations in generalizability and physical consistency due to their excessive reliance on the quantity and quality of training data. In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase with thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML model trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the dynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we develop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical knowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics loss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV and SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the daily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of samples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and early freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.

<title>Towards Explainable Skin Cancer Classification: A Dual-Network Attention Model with Lesion Segmentation and Clinical Metadata Fusion</title>

Abstract: Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly improves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class differences. Many deep learning models operate as "black boxes," limiting clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates (DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019 challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps. These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable skin cancer classification model.

<title>Mapping Post-Training Forgetting in Language Models at Scale</title>

Abstract: Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S. president or an API call) does not "average out" by recalling another. Hence, we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when backward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before post-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to quantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects and obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add chance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random guessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis shows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base models and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on math and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to instruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both forgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed and warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not reliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale -- enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.

<title>SoftMimic: Learning Compliant Whole-body Control from Examples</title>

Abstract: We introduce SoftMimic, a framework for learning compliant whole-body control policies for humanoid robots from example motions. Imitating human motions with reinforcement learning allows humanoids to quickly learn new skills, but existing methods incentivize stiff control that aggressively corrects deviations from a reference motion, leading to brittle and unsafe behavior when the robot encounters unexpected contacts. In contrast, SoftMimic enables robots to respond compliantly to external forces while maintaining balance and posture. Our approach leverages an inverse kinematics solver to generate an augmented dataset of feasible compliant motions, which we use to train a reinforcement learning policy. By rewarding the policy for matching compliant responses rather than rigidly tracking the reference motion, SoftMimic learns to absorb disturbances and generalize to varied tasks from a single motion clip. We validate our method through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating safe and effective interaction with the environment.

Abstract: Finetuning specialized generative evaluators has emerged as a popular paradigm to meet the increasing demand for scalable evaluation during both training and test-time. However, recent work has largely focused on applying new methodology, such as reinforcement learning (RL), to training evaluators, shying away from large-scale, data-driven development. In this work, we focus on data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation tasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification, and single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With our data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family of 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges larger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for open-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static benchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers, FARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training, FARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs. string-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned FARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality.

Abstract: Replicating AI research is a crucial yet challenging task for large language model (LLM) agents. Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable code, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent technical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches tend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured knowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To overcome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a modular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical insights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from scientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two different LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on PaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible solution for automated AI research replication. Code will released at https://github.com/zjunlp/xKG.

Abstract: As information grows exponentially, enterprises face increasing pressure to transform unstructured data into coherent, actionable insights. While autonomous agents show promise, they often struggle with domain-specific nuances, intent alignment, and enterprise integration. We present Enterprise Deep Research (EDR), a multi-agent system that integrates (1) a Master Planning Agent for adaptive query decomposition, (2) four specialized search agents (General, Academic, GitHub, LinkedIn), (3) an extensible MCP-based tool ecosystem supporting NL2SQL, file analysis, and enterprise workflows, (4) a Visualization Agent for data-driven insights, and (5) a reflection mechanism that detects knowledge gaps and updates research direction with optional human-in-the-loop steering guidance. These components enable automated report generation, real-time streaming, and seamless enterprise deployment, as validated on internal datasets. On open-ended benchmarks including DeepResearch Bench and DeepConsult, EDR outperforms state-of-the-art agentic systems without any human steering. We release the EDR framework and benchmark trajectories to advance research on multi-agent reasoning applications.

Abstract: Memory-efficient optimization is critical for training increasingly large language models (LLMs). A popular strategy involves gradient low-rank projection, storing only the projected optimizer states, with GaLore being a representative example. However, a significant drawback of many such methods is their lack of convergence guarantees, as various low-rank projection approaches introduce inherent biases relative to the original optimization algorithms, which contribute to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training. Aiming to tackle this problem, this paper investigates the layerwise sampling technique for debiasing low-rank projection mechanisms. In particular, an instantiation of the paradigm gives rise to a novel and unbiased low-rank optimization method built upon GaLore's mechanism and the Muon algorithm, named GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). We theoretically prove our method matches the convergence guarantees of the base Muon algorithm while preserving the memory efficiency of low-rank techniques. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and pretraining also demonstrate non-trivial improvements over GaLore and even better performance than full-parameter training. Further investigation shows that the improvement of this technique comes from a more uniform distribution of knowledge inside layers, leading to more efficient utilization of the model parameter space and better memorization.

Abstract: Self-play, a learning paradigm where agents iteratively refine their policies by interacting with historical or concurrent versions of themselves or other evolving agents, has shown remarkable success in solving complex non-cooperative multi-agent tasks. Despite its growing prominence in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), such as Go, poker, and video games, a comprehensive and structured understanding of self-play remains lacking. This survey fills this gap by offering a comprehensive roadmap to the diverse landscape of self-play methods. We begin by introducing the necessary preliminaries, including the MARL framework and basic game theory concepts. Then, it provides a unified framework and classifies existing self-play algorithms within this framework. Moreover, the paper bridges the gap between the algorithms and their practical implications by illustrating the role of self-play in different non-cooperative scenarios. Finally, the survey highlights open challenges and future research directions in self-play.

Abstract: Dempster-Shafer structure is effective in classical settings for connecting set-valued hypotheses and representing structured ignorance, yet its practical use is limited by combination growth over focal sets and high conflict management. We observe a mathematical consistency between Dempster-Shafer structure and quantum superposition: elements of the power set form an orthogonal basis, and a basic probability assignment can be encoded as a normalized quantum state whose amplitudes respect mass value constraints. In this paper, we implement the information fusion and correction with Dempster-Shafer structure on quantum circuits, demonstrating that belief functions provide a more concise and effective alternative to Bayesian approaches within the quantum computing framework.Furthermore, by leveraging the unique characteristics of quantum computing, we propose several novel approaches for belief transfer. More broadly, this paper introduces a novel perspective on basic information representation in quantum AI models, proposing that belief functions are better suited than Bayesian approaches for handling uncertainty in quantum circuits.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integral to the hospitality and tourism industry, concerns about their fairness in serving diverse identity groups persist. Grounded in social identity theory and sociotechnical systems theory, this study examines ethnic and gender biases in travel recommendations generated by LLMs. Using fairness probing, we analyze outputs from three leading open-source LLMs. The results show that test accuracy for both ethnicity and gender classifiers exceed random chance. Analysis of the most influential features reveals the presence of stereotype bias in LLM-generated recommendations. We also found hallucinations among these features, occurring more frequently in recommendations for minority groups. These findings indicate that LLMs exhibit ethnic and gender bias when functioning as travel planning assistants. This study underscores the need for bias mitigation strategies to improve the inclusivity and reliability of generative AI-driven travel planning assistance.

Abstract: Enabling digital humans to express rich emotions has significant applications in dialogue systems, gaming, and other interactive scenarios. While recent advances in talking head synthesis have achieved impressive results in lip synchronization, they tend to overlook the rich and dynamic nature of facial expressions. To fill this critical gap, we introduce an end-to-end text-to-expression model that explicitly focuses on emotional dynamics. Our model learns expressive facial variations in a continuous latent space and generates expressions that are diverse, fluid, and emotionally coherent. To support this task, we introduce EmoAva, a large-scale and high-quality dataset containing 15,000 text-3D expression pairs. Extensive experiments on both existing datasets and EmoAva demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, marking a significant advancement in the field.

Our analysis reveals that risks to people increase with the autonomy of a system: The more control a user cedes to an AI agent, the more risks to people arise. Particularly concerning are safety risks, which affect human life and impact further values.

Abstract: Value model guided search is effective in steering LLM generation but suffers from a lack of robustness. This is due to verifier failure: imperfect VMs mistakenly prune valid reasoning paths, especially when encountering unseen reasoning paths generated during search. To address this, we propose an uncertainty-aware framework with two key components: (1) Uncertainty-Aware Value Models (UVMs), which replace single-point value estimates with value distributions to quantify prediction reliability, and (2) Group Thompson Sampling, an efficient algorithm that selects candidates based on their probability of being optimal. Experiments on two In-Distribution (ID) settings (GSM8K, MATH) and three Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) settings (e.g., AIME25, Minerva Math) show our method significantly mitigates verifier failure and boosts solution coverage, especially on OOD problems. This work provides the first systematic integration of uncertainty quantification into LLM search paradigms, enhancing robustness. The code is released at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/UVM.

Abstract: Knowledge components (KCs) mapped to problems help model student learning, tracking their mastery levels on fine-grained skills thereby facilitating personalized learning and feedback in online learning platforms. However, crafting and tagging KCs to problems, traditionally performed by human domain experts, is highly labor intensive. We present an automated, LLM-based pipeline for KC generation and tagging for open-ended programming problems. We also develop an LLM-based knowledge tracing (KT) framework to leverage these LLM-generated KCs, which we refer to as KCGen-KT. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two real-world student code submission datasets in different programming languages.We find that KCGen-KT outperforms existing KT methods and human-written KCs on future student response prediction. We investigate the learning curves of generated KCs and show that LLM-generated KCs result in a better fit than human written KCs under a cognitive model. We also conduct a human evaluation with course instructors to show that our pipeline generates reasonably accurate problem-KC mappings.

Abstract: In various scientific and engineering domains, where data acquisition is costly--such as in medical imaging, environmental monitoring, or remote sensing--strategic sampling from unobserved regions, guided by prior observations, is essential to maximize target discovery within a limited sampling budget. In this work, we introduce Diffusion-guided Active Target Discovery (DiffATD), a novel method that leverages diffusion dynamics for active target discovery. DiffATD maintains a belief distribution over each unobserved state in the environment, using this distribution to dynamically balance exploration-exploitation. Exploration reduces uncertainty by sampling regions with the highest expected entropy, while exploitation targets areas with the highest likelihood of discovering the target, indicated by the belief distribution and an incrementally trained reward model designed to learn the characteristics of the target. DiffATD enables efficient target discovery in a partially observable environment within a fixed sampling budget, all without relying on any prior supervised training. Furthermore, DiffATD offers interpretability, unlike existing black--box policies that require extensive supervised training. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies across diverse domains, including medical imaging, species discovery, and remote sensing, we show that DiffATD performs significantly better than baselines and competitively with supervised methods that operate under full environmental observability.

We introduce RealMath, a novel benchmark derived directly from research papers and mathematical forums that assesses LLMs' abilities on authentic mathematical tasks. Our approach addresses three critical challenges: sourcing diverse research-level content, enabling reliable automated evaluation through verifiable statements, and designing a continually refreshable dataset to mitigate contamination risks. Experimental results across multiple LLMs reveal surprising capabilities in handling research mathematics compared to competition problems, suggesting current models may already serve as valuable assistants for working mathematicians despite limitations on highly challenging problems. The code and dataset for RealMath are publicly available.

Abstract: LLM-based formal proof assistants (e.g., in Lean) hold great promise for automating mathematical discovery. But beyond syntactic correctness, do these systems truly understand mathematical structure as humans do? We investigate this question in context of mathematical inequalities -- specifically the prover's ability to recognize that the given problem simplifies by applying a known inequality such as AM/GM. Specifically, we are interested in their ability to do this in a compositional setting where multiple inequalities must be applied as part of a solution. We introduce Ineq-Comp, a benchmark built from elementary inequalities through systematic transformations, including variable duplication, algebraic rewriting, and multi-step composition. Although these problems remain easy for humans, we find that most provers -- including Goedel, STP, and Kimina-7B -- struggle significantly. DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B shows relative robustness, but still suffers a 20% performance drop (pass@32). Even for DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B model, the gap between compositional variants and seed problems exists, implying that simply scaling up the model size alone does not fully solve the compositional weakness. Strikingly, performance remains poor for all models even when formal proofs of the constituent parts are provided in context, revealing that the source of weakness is indeed in compositional reasoning. Our results expose a persisting gap between the generalization behavior of current AI provers and human mathematical intuition. All data and evaluation code can be found at https://github.com/haoyuzhao123/LeanIneqComp.

Abstract: Despite widespread adoption, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) suffer performance degradation when encountering unfamiliar queries under distribution shifts. Existing methods to improve MLLM generalization typically require either more instruction data or larger advanced model architectures, both of which incur non-trivial human labor or computational costs. In this work, we take an alternative approach to enhance the generalization and robustness of MLLMs under distribution shifts, from a representation learning perspective. Inspired by information bottleneck (IB) principle, we derive a variational lower bound of the IB for MLLMs and devise a practical implementation, Visual Instruction Bottleneck Tuning (Vittle). We then provide a theoretical justification of Vittle by revealing its connection to an information-theoretic robustness metric of MLLM. Empirical validation of multiple MLLMs on open-ended and closed-form question answering and object hallucination detection tasks over 45 datasets, including 30 shift scenarios, demonstrates that Vittle consistently improves the MLLM's robustness under shifts by pursuing the learning of a minimal sufficient representation.

Abstract: Urban traffic congestion, particularly at intersections, significantly impacts travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions. Traditional fixed-time signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency. More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world implementation challenges.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is central to artificial intelligence, with applications in education, code generation, and research-level mathematical discovery. Mathematical competitions highlight two problem types: theorem proving, requiring rigorous proofs, and answer construction, requiring creative generation and formal verification of mathematical objects. Existing research reveals that LLMs can tackle difficult answer-construction tasks but are prone to errors from hallucinations and unverifiable steps, while symbolic methods guarantee rigor but falter in creative answer construction. This raises a key understudied question: how to solve answer-construction problems while preserving both LLM creativity and mathematical rigor? To address this problem, we introduce the Enumerate-Conjecture-Prove (ECP) framework, a modular neuro-symbolic method integrating LLM-based enumeration and pattern-driven conjecturing with formal theorem proving in Lean, and ConstructiveBench, a dataset of 3,640 formal answer-construction problems from math competitions. ECP is model agnostic and shows consistent improvements over pure LLM baselines: on the subset of PutnamBench for answer construction, ECP formally solves 6 out of 337 answer-construction problems end to end (up from 4 without ECP) using GPT-5 mini and DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B. On ConstructiveBench, ECP achieves 33.1% end-to-end state-of-the-art accuracy (up from 32.5%), demonstrating its potential to advance formal mathematical reasoning by combining LLM conjecturing with formal verification. Our code and dataset are publicly available at GitHub (https://github.com/sunjia72/ECP) and Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/datasets/sunjia72/ConstructiveBench).

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of LLM-based agents, the reliable evaluation of their safety and security remains a significant challenge. Existing rule-based or LLM-based evaluators often miss dangers in agents' step-by-step actions, overlook subtle meanings, fail to see how small issues compound, and get confused by unclear safety or security rules. To overcome this evaluation crisis, we introduce AgentAuditor, a universal, training-free, memory-augmented reasoning framework that empowers LLM evaluators to emulate human expert evaluators. AgentAuditor constructs an experiential memory by having an LLM adaptively extract structured semantic features (e.g., scenario, risk, behavior) and generate associated chain-of-thought reasoning traces for past interactions. A multi-stage, context-aware retrieval-augmented generation process then dynamically retrieves the most relevant reasoning experiences to guide the LLM evaluator's assessment of new cases. Moreover, we developed ASSEBench, the first benchmark designed to check how well LLM-based evaluators can spot both safety risks and security threats. ASSEBench comprises 2293 meticulously annotated interaction records, covering 15 risk types across 29 application scenarios. A key feature of ASSEBench is its nuanced approach to ambiguous risk situations, employing "Strict" and "Lenient" judgment standards. Experiments demonstrate that AgentAuditor not only consistently improves the evaluation performance of LLMs across all benchmarks but also sets a new state-of-the-art in LLM-as-a-judge for agent safety and security, achieving human-level accuracy.

Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show promising capabilities for automating computer-use tasks and facilitating accessibility, but existing interactive benchmarks are mostly English-only, covering web-use or Windows, Linux, and Android environments, but not macOS. macOS is a major OS with distinctive GUI patterns and exclusive applications. To bridge the gaps, we present macOSWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GUI agents on macOS. macOSWorld features 202 multilingual interactive tasks across 30 applications (28 macOS-exclusive), with task instructions and OS interfaces offered in 5 languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Russian). As GUI agents are shown to be vulnerable to deception attacks, macOSWorld also includes a dedicated safety benchmarking subset. Our evaluation on six GUI agents reveals a dramatic gap: proprietary computer-use agents lead at above 30% success rate, while open-source lightweight research models lag at below 5\%, highlighting the need for macOS domain adaptation. Multilingual benchmarks also expose common weaknesses, especially in Arabic, with a 28.8% average degradation compared to English. Results from safety benchmarking also highlight that deception attacks are more general and demand immediate attention. Project page: https://macos-world.github.io.

Abstract: Effective coordination among artificial agents in dynamic and uncertain environments remains a significant challenge in multi-agent systems. Existing approaches, such as self-play and population-based methods, either generalize poorly to unseen partners or require impractically extensive fine-tuning. To overcome these limitations, we propose Coordination Transformers (\coot), a novel in-context coordination framework that uses recent interaction histories to rapidly adapt to unseen partners. Unlike prior approaches that primarily aim to diversify training partners, \coot explicitly focuses on adapting to new partner behaviors by predicting actions aligned with observed interactions. Trained on trajectories collected from diverse pairs of agents with complementary preferences, \coot quickly learns effective coordination strategies without explicit supervision or parameter updates. Across diverse coordination tasks in Overcooked, \coot consistently outperforms baselines including population-based approaches, gradient-based fine-tuning, and a Meta-RL-inspired contextual adaptation method. Notably, fine-tuning proves unstable and ineffective, while Meta-RL struggles to achieve reliable coordination. By contrast, \coot achieves stable, rapid in-context adaptation and is consistently ranked the most effective collaborator in human evaluations.

<title>Does Math Reasoning Improve General LLM Capabilities? Understanding Transferability of LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week, it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20 open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for advancing reasoning models.

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle, and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most basic form of supervised learning. By defining two Lawvere-enriched categories corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning. We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

Abstract: Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through self-exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and 33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at 10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL, direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches underperformed DARIL--world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising. Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of occupational AI impact.

<title>RL-PLUS: Countering Capability Boundary Collapse of LLMs in Reinforcement Learning with Hybrid-policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1) state-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements up to 69.2\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.

Abstract: The increasing demand for long-context modeling in large language models (LLMs) is bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention mechanism. The community has proposed sparse attention to mitigate this issue. However, position-aware sparse attention methods rely on static sparse structures that lack adaptability to diverse query contexts, while content-aware sparse attention methods depend on heuristic key-value selection, hindering full differentiability. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask sparse attention mechanism, a method that merges the advantages of both position-aware and content-aware approaches. Dynamic Mask Attention (DMA) achieves this through three key innovations: First, it leverages value vector representations to generate content-aware dynamic masks, enabling the model to adaptively identify and attend to critical information. Second, it computes position-aware sparse weights in a hardware-friendly manner, efficiently skipping unnecessary computational regions. Finally, we demonstrate that the introduced dynamic mask and sparse weights do not obstruct gradients, supporting end-to-end training. We have validated the performance of DMA through comprehensive experiments. A large body of experimental evidence shows that DMA consistently holds a Pareto advantage over state-of-the-art sparse attention baselines in tasks including scaling laws, multi-query associative recall, standard benchmarks, and needle in a haystack tests, while also delivering up to a 10x overall speedup. These results highlight its ability to effectively balance model efficiency with long-context modeling capabilities. Our computational kernel code is now open-source at https://github.com/SmallDoges/flash-dmattn to encourage further research and application by the community.

Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges.

<title>BASIL: Bayesian Assessment of Sycophancy in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Sycophancy (overly agreeable or flattering behavior) is critical to understand in the context of human-AI collaboration, especially in decision-making settings like health, law, and education. Existing methods for studying sycophancy in LLMs are either descriptive (study behavior change when sycophancy is elicited) or normative (provide values-based judgment on behavior change). Together, these approaches help us understand the extent, and impacts, of sycophancy. However, existing normative approaches only apply for objective tasks where ground-truth data exists, ignoring the natural subjectivity in many NLP tasks.
  Drawing from behavioral economics and rational decision theory, we introduce an Bayesian framework to study the normative effects of sycophancy on rationality in LLMs, without requiring labeled ground-truth. Using this interdisciplinary framework, we study sycophantic behavior in multiple LLM baselines across three different tasks, experimenting with various methods for eliciting sycophancy and obtaining probability judgments from LLMs. We find significant evidence of sycophancy in our experiments (7 of 8 baselines for one of our probing techniques), and observe that sycophancy is more likely to reduce rationality than it is to increase rationality in LLMs' decisions when they are directly probed for probabilities (2 out of 4 baselines show significant increases overall).

Abstract: Procedural content generation often requires satisfying both designer-specified objectives and adjacency constraints implicitly imposed by the underlying tile set. To address the challenges of jointly optimizing both constraints and objectives, we reformulate WaveFunctionCollapse (WFC) as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling external optimization algorithms to focus exclusively on objective maximization while leveraging WFC's propagation mechanism to enforce constraint satisfaction. We empirically compare optimizing this MDP to traditional evolutionary approaches that jointly optimize global metrics and local tile placement. Across multiple domains with various difficulties, we find that joint optimization not only struggles as task complexity increases, but consistently underperforms relative to optimization over the WFC-MDP, underscoring the advantages of decoupling local constraint satisfaction from global objective optimization.

Abstract: The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language models (LMs), has shown a critical role in various environments that require intelligent and autonomous decision-making. Environments are not passive testing grounds, and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit in very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex, and autonomous capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of \emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal logic. In this work, we use immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make an informed root cause diagnosis, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for proper, reliable, and explainable diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents.

Abstract: Current AI alignment through RLHF follows a single directional paradigm that AI conforms to human preferences while treating human cognition as fixed. We propose a shift to co-alignment through Bidirectional Cognitive Alignment (BiCA), where humans and AI mutually adapt. BiCA uses learnable protocols, representation mapping, and KL-budget constraints for controlled co-evolution. In collaborative navigation, BiCA achieved 85.5% success versus 70.3% baseline, with 230% better mutual adaptation and 332% better protocol convergence. Emergent protocols outperformed handcrafted ones by 84%, while bidirectional adaptation unexpectedly improved safety (+23% out-of-distribution robustness). The 46% synergy improvement demonstrates optimal collaboration exists at the intersection, not union, of human and AI capabilities, validating the shift from single-directional to co-alignment paradigms.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning propositional STRIPS world models from action traces alone, using a deep learning architecture (transformers) and gradient descent. The task is cast as a supervised next token prediction problem where the tokens are the actions, and an action $a$ may follow an action sequence if the hidden effects of the previous actions do not make an action precondition of $a$ false. We show that a suitable transformer architecture can faithfully represent propositional STRIPS world models, and that the models can be learned from sets of random valid (positive) and invalid (negative) action sequences alone. A number of experiments are reported.

Abstract: This paper introduces CoBRA, a novel toolkit for systematically specifying agent behavior in LLM-based social simulation. We found that conventional approaches that specify agent behaviors through implicit natural language descriptions cannot yield consistent behaviors across models, and the produced agent behaviors do not capture the nuances of the descriptions. In contrast, CoBRA presents a new approach to program agents' cognitive biases explicitly, by grounding agents' expected behaviors using classic social science experiments. CoBRA has two components: (1) Cognitive Bias Index that measures the cognitive bias of a social agent, by quantifying the agent's reactions in a set of validated classical social science experiments; (2) Behavioral Regulation Engine that aligns the agent's behavior to demonstrate controlled cognitive bias. We evaluated CoBRA as an HCI toolkit through demonstration and technical benchmarks. Our results suggest that CoBRA can precisely program the cognitive bias demonstrated in a social agent in a model-agnostic manner.

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language models (LLMs) on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating more compute at inference. LLM Inference via Tree Search (LITS) methods achieve strong performance but are highly inefficient, often running an order of magnitude slower than iterative approaches. We propose Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in framework that decides when to branch during search rather than expanding at every step. CiT introduces lightweight Branching Necessity (BN) evaluations: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM judges branching needs, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which clusters candidate actions to assess agreement. Integrated into Tree of Thoughts, ReST-MCTS, and RAP, BN-DP achieves 75-85% reductions in token generation, model calls, and runtime on GSM8K and Math500, with often negligible or no accuracy loss. BN-SC typically yields substantial savings (up to 80%) generally but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14 settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce extremely long reasoning steps. We theoretically prove that BN-DP never increases policy invocations and release both modular LITS implementations and a lightweight CiT function applicable across all LITS variants. The full codebase is publicly available at https://github.com/xinzhel/chain_in_tree.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving, cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However, local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks: tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases, and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities, such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper investigates the key question: \textit{Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological counseling?} To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S. National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a role. To address this, we introduce PsychCounsel-Bench, a benchmark grounded in U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional counselors that requires about 70\% accuracy to pass. PsychCounsel-Bench comprises approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B) remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs. We release the proposed dataset for public use: https://github.com/cloversjtu/PsychCounsel-Bench

Abstract: The rapid advancement of embodied intelligence and world models has intensified efforts to integrate physical laws into AI systems, yet physical perception and symbolic physics reasoning have developed along separate trajectories without a unified bridging framework. This work provides a comprehensive overview of physical AI, establishing clear distinctions between theoretical physics reasoning and applied physical understanding while systematically examining how physics-grounded methods enhance AI's real-world comprehension across structured symbolic reasoning, embodied systems, and generative models. Through rigorous analysis of recent advances, we advocate for intelligent systems that ground learning in both physical principles and embodied reasoning processes, transcending pattern recognition toward genuine understanding of physical laws. Our synthesis envisions next-generation world models capable of explaining physical phenomena and predicting future states, advancing safe, generalizable, and interpretable AI systems.

<title>Optimizing for Persuasion Improves LLM Generalization: Evidence from Quality-Diversity Evolution of Debate Strategies</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories (rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters) and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade, rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

<title>DRIFT: Decompose, Retrieve, Illustrate, then Formalize Theorems</title>

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation: informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet, ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and 42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

<title>Graph Neural Networks for the Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling Problem</title>

Abstract: This study investigates how to schedule nanosatellite tasks more efficiently using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In the Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling (ONTS) problem, the goal is to find the optimal schedule for tasks to be carried out in orbit while taking into account Quality-of-Service (QoS) considerations such as priority, minimum and maximum activation events, execution time-frames, periods, and execution windows, as well as constraints on the satellite's power resources and the complexity of energy harvesting and management. The ONTS problem has been approached using conventional mathematical formulations and exact methods, but their applicability to challenging cases of the problem is limited. This study examines the use of GNNs in this context, which has been effectively applied to optimization problems such as the traveling salesman, scheduling, and facility placement problems. More specifically, we investigate whether GNNs can learn the complex structure of the ONTS problem with respect to feasibility and optimality of candidate solutions. Furthermore, we evaluate using GNN-based heuristic solutions to provide better solutions (w.r.t. the objective value) to the ONTS problem and reduce the optimization cost. Our experiments show that GNNs are not only able to learn feasibility and optimality for instances of the ONTS problem, but they can generalize to harder instances than those seen during training. Furthermore, the GNN-based heuristics improved the expected objective value of the best solution found under the time limit in 45%, and reduced the expected time to find a feasible solution in 35%, when compared to the SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programs) solver in its off-the-shelf configuration

Abstract: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Nevertheless, early diagnosis of cancer is a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to medical resources and trained radiologists is limited. The objective of this study is to propose an automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for the early detection and classification of lung nodules, specifically for low-resource settings. The proposed framework consists of three stages: lung segmentation using a modified 3D U-Net named 3D Res-U-Net, nodule detection using YOLO-v5, and classification with a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We evaluated the proposed framework on a publicly available dataset, LUNA16. The proposed framework's performance was measured using the respective domain's evaluation matrices. The proposed framework achieved a 98.82% lung segmentation dice score while detecting the lung nodule with 0.76 mAP@50 from the segmented lung, at a low false-positive rate. The performance of both networks of the proposed framework was compared with other studies and found to outperform them regarding segmentation and detection accuracy. Additionally, our proposed Vision transformer network obtained an accuracy of 93.57%, which is 1.21% higher than the state-of-the-art networks. Our proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can effectively segment lungs, and detect and classify lung nodules, specifically in low-resource settings with limited access to radiologists. The proposed framework outperforms existing studies regarding all the respective evaluation metrics. The proposed framework can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening in low-resource settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

Abstract: Experimental and observational studies often lack validity due to untestable assumptions. We propose a double machine learning approach to combine experimental and observational studies, allowing practitioners to test for assumption violations and estimate treatment effects consistently. Our framework proposes a falsification test for external validity and ignorability under milder assumptions. We provide consistent treatment effect estimators even when one of the assumptions is violated. However, our no-free-lunch theorem highlights the necessity of accurately identifying the violated assumption for consistent treatment effect estimation. Through comparative analyses, we show our framework's superiority over existing data fusion methods. The practical utility of our approach is further exemplified by three real-world case studies, underscoring its potential for widespread application in empirical research.

arXiv:2310.00488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms that seek flatter minima such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) are widely credited with improved generalization. We ask whether such gains impact membership privacy. Surprisingly, we find that SAM is more prone to membership inference attacks than classical SGD across multiple datasets and attack methods, despite achieving lower test error. This is an intriguing phenomenon as conventional belief posits that higher membership privacy risk is associated with poor generalization. We conjecture that SAM is capable of memorizing atypical subpatterns more, leading to better generalization but higher privacy risk. We empirically validate our hypothesis by running extensive analysis on memorization and influence scores. Finally, we theoretically show how a model that captures minority subclass features more can effectively generalize better \emph{and} have higher membership privacy risk.

<title>Diffusion Models as Constrained Samplers for Optimization with Unknown Constraints</title>

arXiv:2402.18012v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing real-world optimization problems becomes particularly challenging when analytic objective functions or constraints are unavailable. While numerous studies have addressed the issue of unknown objectives, limited research has focused on scenarios where feasibility constraints are not given explicitly. Overlooking these constraints can lead to spurious solutions that are unrealistic in practice. To deal with such unknown constraints, we propose to perform optimization within the data manifold using diffusion models. To constrain the optimization process to the data manifold, we reformulate the original optimization problem as a sampling problem from the product of the Boltzmann distribution defined by the objective function and the data distribution learned by the diffusion model. Depending on the differentiability of the objective function, we propose two different sampling methods. For differentiable objectives, we propose a two-stage framework that begins with a guided diffusion process for warm-up, followed by a Langevin dynamics stage for further correction. For non-differentiable objectives, we propose an iterative importance sampling strategy using the diffusion model as the proposal distribution. Comprehensive experiments on a synthetic dataset, six real-world black-box optimization datasets, and a multi-objective molecule optimization dataset show that our method achieves better or comparable performance with previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: A post embedding (representation of text in embedding space that effectively captures semantic meaning) is a foundational component of LinkedIn that is consumed by product surfaces in retrieval and ranking (e.g., ranking posts in the feed or video tab). This paper presents the post embeddings used at LinkedIn, where a pre-trained transformer-based large language model (LLM) is taken as input and fine-tuned using multi-task learning across a diverse set of semantic labeling tasks. We observe positive transfer, leading to improved performance across all tasks, compared to training them independently. The generated post embeddings outperform baseline models in zero-shot learning, demonstrating its potential for broader applicability. Furthermore, the generated post embeddings' performance surpasses that of OpenAI's ADA-001 and ADA-002 embeddings on LinkedIn specific datasets and tasks. We also describe the offline evaluation methodology and the deployment to our near-line infrastructure, which makes the post embedding available for use within minutes of post creation for any downstream application. We present how the embeddings were applied in the Feed product surface, in both ranking and retrieval stages, and showcase the real world online impact to demonstrate the superior performance of these embeddings. Finally, we also share the results of applying the embeddings to the retrieval system of our video ranking product surface in LinkedIn. These embeddings have been battle-tested in production at LinkedIn for over two years, consistently powering multiple products.

<title>Predicting High-precision Depth on Low-Precision Devices Using 2D Hilbert Curves</title>

Abstract: Dense depth prediction deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved impressive results for both monocular and binocular data, but still they are limited by high computational complexity, restricting their use on low-end devices. For better on-device efficiency and hardware utilization, weights and activations of the DNN should be converted to low-bit precision. However, this precision is not sufficient to represent high dynamic range depth. In this paper, we aim to overcome this limitation and restore high-precision depth from low-bit precision predictions. To achieve this, we propose to represent high dynamic range depth as two low dynamic range components of a Hilbert curve, and to train the full-precision DNN to directly predict the latter. For on-device deployment, we use standard quantization methods and add a post-processing step that reconstructs depth from the Hilbert curve components predicted in low-bit precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method increases the bit precision of predicted depth by up to three bits with little computational overhead. We also observed a positive side effect of quantization error reduction by up to 4.6 times. Our method enables effective and accurate depth prediction with DNN weights and activations quantized to eight-bit precision.

Abstract: We prove that the combination of a target network and over-parameterized linear function approximation establishes a weaker convergence condition for bootstrapped value estimation in certain cases, even with off-policy data. Our condition is naturally satisfied for expected updates over the entire state-action space or learning with a batch of complete trajectories from episodic Markov decision processes. Notably, using only a target network or an over-parameterized model does not provide such a convergence guarantee. Additionally, we extend our results to learning with truncated trajectories, showing that convergence is achievable for all tasks with minor modifications, akin to value truncation for the final states in trajectories. Our primary result focuses on temporal difference estimation for prediction, providing high-probability value estimation error bounds and empirical analysis on Baird's counterexample and a Four-room task. Furthermore, we explore the control setting, demonstrating that similar convergence conditions apply to Q-learning.

Abstract: As pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have become a useful tool for image synthesis, people want to specify the results in various ways. This paper tackles training-free appearance transfer, which produces an image with the structure of a target image from the appearance of a reference image. Existing methods usually do not reflect semantic correspondence, as they rely on query-key similarity within the self-attention layer to establish correspondences between images. To this end, we propose explicitly rearranging the features according to the dense semantic correspondences. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method in various aspects: preserving the structure of the target and reflecting the correct color from the reference, even when the two images are not aligned.

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM) involves identifying and extracting Argumentative Components (ACs) and their corresponding Argumentative Relations (ARs). Most of the prior works have broken down these tasks into multiple sub-tasks. Existing end-to-end setups primarily use the dependency parsing approach. This work introduces a generative paradigm-based end-to-end framework argTANL. argTANL frames the argumentative structures into label-augmented text, called Augmented Natural Language (ANL). This framework jointly extracts both ACs and ARs from a given argumentative text. Additionally, this study explores the impact of Argumentative and Discourse markers on enhancing the model's performance within the proposed framework. Two distinct frameworks, Marker-Enhanced argTANL (ME-argTANL) and argTANL with specialized Marker-Based Fine-Tuning, are proposed to achieve this. Extensive experiments are conducted on three standard AM benchmarks to demonstrate the superior performance of the ME-argTANL.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks. Typically, LLMs are first pre-trained on large corpora and subsequently fine-tuned on task-specific datasets. However, during fine-tuning, LLMs may forget some knowledge acquired in the pre-training stage, leading to a decline in general capabilities. Existing approaches to mitigate forgetting often rely on access to pre-training data, which may be unavailable in many real-world scenarios--such as fine-tuning checkpoint-only open-source LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a new fine-tuning algorithm termed Momentum-Filtered Optimizer (MoFO). MoFO is an extension of greedy block coordinate descent (BCD) methods: in each iteration, MoFO only updates the model parameters with the largest momentum magnitudes, while keeping all other parameters fixed. MoFO achieves similar fine-tuning performance to the default fine-tuning algorithm while effectively mitigating knowledge forgetting. We validate MoFO through rigorous convergence analysis and extensive experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating forgetting without pre-training data.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have emerged as a powerful technique for learning representations from user-item interaction data in collaborative filtering (CF) for recommender systems. However, many existing methods heavily rely on unique user and item IDs, which restricts their performance in zero-shot learning scenarios. Inspired by the success of language models (LMs) and their robust generalization capabilities, we pose the question: How can we leverage language models to enhance recommender systems? We propose EasyRec, an effective approach that integrates text-based semantic understanding with collaborative signals. EasyRec employs a text-behavior alignment framework that combines contrastive learning with collaborative language model tuning. This ensures strong alignment between text-enhanced semantic representations and collaborative behavior information. Extensive evaluations across diverse datasets show EasyRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in text-based zero-shot recommendation. EasyRec functions as a plug-and-play component that integrates seamlessly into collaborative filtering frameworks. This empowers existing systems with improved performance and adaptability to user preferences. Implementation codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/EasyRec.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves large language models (LMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge through evidence retrieved from external sources. However, it often struggles to cope with inconsistent and irrelevant information that can distract the LM from its tasks, especially when multiple evidence pieces are required. While compressing the retrieved evidence with a compression model aims to address this issue, the compressed evidence may still be unfamiliar to the target model used for downstream tasks, potentially failing to utilize the evidence effectively. We propose FaviComp (Familarity-Aware Evidence Compression), a novel training-free evidence compression technique that makes retrieved evidence more familiar to the target model, while seamlessly integrating parametric knowledge from the model. Experimental results show that FaviComp consistently outperforms most recent evidence compression baselines across multiple open-domain QA datasets, improving accuracy by up to 28.1% while achieving high compression rates. Additionally, we demonstrate the effective integration of both parametric and non-parametric knowledge during evidence compression.

Abstract: As networks continue to expand and become more interconnected, the need for novel malware detection methods becomes more pronounced. Traditional security measures are increasingly inadequate against the sophistication of modern cyber attacks. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) has been pivotal in enhancing network security, offering an in-depth analysis of network traffic that surpasses conventional monitoring techniques. DPI not only examines the metadata of network packets, but also dives into the actual content being carried within the packet payloads, providing a comprehensive view of the data flowing through networks. While the integration of advanced deep learning techniques with DPI has introduced modern methodologies into malware detection and network traffic classification, state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches are limited by their reliance on large amounts of annotated data and their inability to generalize to novel, unseen malware threats. To address these limitations, this paper leverages the recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL) and few-shot learning (FSL). Our proposed self-supervised approach trains a transformer via SSL to learn the embedding of packet content, including payload, from vast amounts of unlabeled data by masking portions of packets, leading to a learned representation that generalizes to various downstream tasks. Once the representation is extracted from the packets, they are used to train a malware detection algorithm. The representation obtained from the transformer is then used to adapt the malware detector to novel types of attacks using few-shot learning approaches. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves classification accuracies of up to 94.76% on the UNSW-NB15 dataset and 83.25% on the CIC-IoT23 dataset.

Abstract: Classical reinforcement learning (RL) typically assumes rational decision-making based on expected utility theory. However, this model has been shown to be empirically inconsistent with actual human preferences, as evidenced in psychology and behavioral economics. Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) provides a more nuanced model for human-based decision-making, capturing diverse attitudes and perceptions toward risk, gains, and losses. While prior work has integrated CPT with RL to solve CPT policy optimization problems, the understanding and impact of this formulation remain limited. Our contributions are as follows: (a) we derive a novel policy gradient theorem for CPT objectives, generalizing the foundational result in standard RL, (b) we design a model-free policy gradient algorithm for solving the CPT-RL problem, (c) we analyze our policy gradient estimator and prove asymptotic convergence of the algorithm to first-order stationary points, and (d) test its performance through simulations. Notably, our first-order policy gradient algorithm scales better than existing zeroth-order methods to larger state spaces. Our theoretical framework offers more flexibility to advance the integration of behavioral decision-making into RL.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical in high-stakes applications, such as medical diagnosis, where confidently incorrect predictions can erode trust in automated decision-making systems. Traditional uncertainty quantification methods rely on a predefined confidence threshold to classify predictions as confident or uncertain. However, this approach assumes that predictions exceeding the threshold are trustworthy, while those below it are uncertain, without explicitly assessing the correctness of high-confidence predictions. As a result, confidently incorrect predictions may still occur, leading to misleading uncertainty assessments. To address this limitation, this study proposed an uncertainty-aware stacked neural network, which extends conventional uncertainty quantification by learning when predictions should be trusted. The framework consists of a two-tier model: the base model generates predictions with uncertainty estimates, while the meta-model learns to assign a trust flag, distinguishing confidently correct cases from those requiring expert review. The proposed approach is evaluated against the traditional threshold-based method across multiple confidence thresholds and pre-trained architectures using the COVIDx CXR-4 dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces confidently incorrect predictions, offering a more trustworthy and efficient decision-support system for high-stakes domains.

Abstract: This work studies the problem of large language model (LLM) unlearning, aiming to remove unwanted data influences (e.g., copyrighted or harmful content) while preserving model utility. Despite the increasing demand for unlearning, a technically-grounded optimization framework is lacking. Gradient ascent (GA)-type methods, though widely used, are suboptimal as they reverse the learning process without controlling optimization divergence (i.e., deviation from the pre-trained state), leading to risks of over-forgetting and potential model collapse. Negative preference optimization (NPO) has been proposed to address this issue and is considered one of the state-of-the-art LLM unlearning approaches. In this work, we revisit NPO and identify another critical issue: reference model bias. This bias arises from using the reference model (i.e., the model prior to unlearning) to evaluate the unlearning success, which can compromise NPO's effectiveness. Specifically, it leads to (a) uneven allocation of optimization power across forget data with varying difficulty levels and (b) ineffective gradient weight smoothing during the early stages of unlearning optimization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that `simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the lens of simple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We provide deeper insights into SimNPO's advantages through an analysis based on mixtures of Markov chains. Extensive experiments further validate SimNPO's efficacy on benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, as well as its robustness against relearning attacks.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuned for a specific downstream task. The most common fine-tuning method is to update pretrained weights via low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Existing initialization strategies for LoRA often rely on singular value decompositions (SVD) of gradients or weight matrices. However, they do not provably maximize the expected gradient signal, which is critical for fast adaptation. To this end, we introduce Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA), an initialization scheme that uses the directions capturing the most activation variance, provably maximizing the expected gradient signal and accelerating fine-tuning. EVA performs incremental SVD on minibatches of activation vectors and selects the right-singular vectors for initialization once they converged. Further, by selecting the directions that capture the most activation-variance for a given rank budget, EVA accommodates adaptive ranks that reduce the number of trainable parameters. We apply EVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks as language generation and understanding, image classification, and reinforcement learning. EVA exhibits faster convergence than competitors and achieves the highest average score across a multitude of tasks per domain while reducing the number of trainable parameters through rank redistribution. In summary, EVA establishes a new Pareto frontier compared to existing LoRA initialization schemes in both accuracy and efficiency.

<title>HardNet: Hard-Constrained Neural Networks with Universal Approximation Guarantees</title>

Abstract: Incorporating prior knowledge or specifications of input-output relationships into machine learning models has attracted significant attention, as it enhances generalization from limited data and yields conforming outputs. However, most existing approaches use soft constraints by penalizing violations through regularization, which offers no guarantee of constraint satisfaction, especially on inputs far from the training distribution--an essential requirement in safety-critical applications. On the other hand, imposing hard constraints on neural networks may hinder their representational power, adversely affecting performance. To address this, we propose HardNet, a practical framework for constructing neural networks that inherently satisfy hard constraints without sacrificing model capacity. Unlike approaches that modify outputs only at inference time, HardNet enables end-to-end training with hard constraint guarantees, leading to improved performance. To the best of our knowledge, HardNet is the first method that enables efficient and differentiable enforcement of more than one input-dependent inequality constraint. It allows unconstrained optimization of the network parameters using standard algorithms by appending a differentiable closed-form enforcement layer to the network's output. Furthermore, we show that HardNet retains neural networks' universal approximation capabilities. We demonstrate its versatility and effectiveness across various applications: learning with piecewise constraints, learning optimization solvers with guaranteed feasibility, and optimizing control policies in safety-critical systems.

Abstract: Osteoporosis is a common condition that increases fracture risk, especially in older adults. Early diagnosis is vital for preventing fractures, reducing treatment costs, and preserving mobility. However, healthcare providers face challenges like limited labeled data and difficulties in processing medical images. This study presents a novel multi-modal learning framework that integrates clinical and imaging data to improve diagnostic accuracy and model interpretability. The model utilizes three pre-trained networks-VGG19, InceptionV3, and ResNet50-to extract deep features from X-ray images. These features are transformed using PCA to reduce dimensionality and focus on the most relevant components. A clustering-based selection process identifies the most representative components, which are then combined with preprocessed clinical data and processed through a fully connected network (FCN) for final classification. A feature importance plot highlights key variables, showing that Medical History, BMI, and Height were the main contributors, emphasizing the significance of patient-specific data. While imaging features were valuable, they had lower importance, indicating that clinical data are crucial for accurate predictions. This framework promotes precise and interpretable predictions, enhancing transparency and building trust in AI-driven diagnoses for clinical integration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based Agents have been applied to fix bugs automatically, demonstrating the capability in addressing software defects by engaging in development environment interaction, iterative validation and code modification. However, systematic analysis of these agent systems remain limited, particularly regarding performance variations among top-performing ones. In this paper, we examine six repair systems on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark for automated bug fixing. We first assess each system's overall performance, noting the instances solvable by all or none of these systems, and explore the capabilities of different systems. We also compare fault localization accuracy at file and code symbol levels and evaluate bug reproduction capabilities. Through analysis, we concluded that further optimization is needed in both the LLM capability itself and the design of Agentic flow to improve the effectiveness of the Agent in bug fixing.

Abstract: The urban environment is characterized by complex spatio-temporal dynamics arising from diverse human activities and interactions. Effectively modeling these dynamics is essential for understanding and optimizing urban systems. In this work, we introduce UrbanDiT, a foundation model for open-world urban spatio-temporal learning that successfully scales up diffusion transformers in this field. UrbanDiT pioneers a unified model that integrates diverse data sources and types while learning universal spatio-temporal patterns across different cities and scenarios. This allows the model to unify both multi-data and multi-task learning, and effectively support a wide range of spatio-temporal applications. Its key innovation lies in the elaborated prompt learning framework, which adaptively generates both data-driven and task-specific prompts, guiding the model to deliver superior performance across various urban applications. UrbanDiT offers three advantages: 1) It unifies diverse data types, such as grid-based and graph-based data, into a sequential format; 2) With task-specific prompts, it supports a wide range of tasks, including bi-directional spatio-temporal prediction, temporal interpolation, spatial extrapolation, and spatio-temporal imputation; and 3) It generalizes effectively to open-world scenarios, with its powerful zero-shot capabilities outperforming nearly all baselines with training data. UrbanDiT sets up a new benchmark for foundation models in the urban spatio-temporal domain. Code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UrbanDiT.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of language models (LMs) has caused a huge surge in demand for GPUs. Training large LMs requires tens of thousands of GPUs and housing them in the same datacenter (DC) is a challenge due to many constraints including availability of peak power. We focus on training such models across multiple DCs connected via the Wide-Area-Network (WAN). We built Atlas that speeds up the training time using novel workload-aware temporal bandwidth sharing and other design choices. While Atlas improves the training time, it does not completely eliminate the bubbles (idle GPU cycles). We built BubbleTea that runs prefill-as-a-service (part of LM inference) during the bubbles thus improving the GPU utilization without any impact on training. Compared to state-of-the-art designs, Atlas and BubbleTea together achieve up to 17x faster training, and up to 94% GPU utilization. The code will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks for text-to-video (T2V) synthesis. However, achieving accurate text alignment in T2V generation remains challenging due to the complex temporal dependencies across frames. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches to enhance text alignment often require differentiable reward functions trained for videos, hindering their scalability and applicability. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Free$^2$Guide}, a novel gradient-free and training-free framework for aligning generated videos with text prompts. Specifically, leveraging principles from path integral control, Free$^2$Guide approximates guidance for diffusion models using non-differentiable reward functions, thereby enabling the integration of powerful black-box Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as reward models. To enable image-trained LVLMs to assess text-to-video alignment, we leverage \textit{stitching} between video frames and use system prompts to capture sequential attributions. Our framework supports the flexible ensembling of multiple reward models to synergistically enhance alignment without significant computational overhead. Experimental results confirm that Free$^2$Guide using image-trained LVLMs significantly improves text-to-video alignment, thereby enhancing the overall video quality. Our results and code are available at https://kjm981995.github.io/free2guide/

<title>H3Fusion: Helpful, Harmless, Honest Fusion of Aligned LLMs</title>

Abstract: The alignment of pre-trained LLMs continues to draw significant attention from both industry and academia, aiming to ensure responses that are helpful, harmless, and honest. However, identifying a point in the model's representation subspace that simultaneously satisfies all these properties remains challenging. H3Fusion addresses this challenge by introducing a mixture-of-experts (MoE)-based fusion mechanism that models alignment as a controllable drift within the subspace, guided by a drift-regularization loss to balance competing alignment dimensions. Furthermore, we formulate the alignment by finding a dual objective of harnessing the distance of generated embeddings and alignment embeddings, and introduce a gating loss by canalizing the activations on the contributing experts. Extensive evaluations of three benchmark datasets show that H3Fusion is more helpful, less harmful, and more honest in three aspects: it outperforms each individually aligned model by 11.37%, and provides stronger robustness compared to the state-of-the-art LLM ensemble approaches by 13.77% and model-merging approaches by 6.18%. Code is available at https://github.com/sftekin/h3fusion.

Abstract: The exponential growth of large-scale telescope arrays has boosted time-domain astronomy development but introduced operational bottlenecks, including labor-intensive observation planning, data processing, and real-time decision-making. Here we present the StarWhisper Telescope system, an AI agent framework automating end-to-end astronomical observations for surveys like the Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey. By integrating large language models with specialized function calls and modular workflows, StarWhisper Telescope autonomously generates site-specific observation lists, executes real-time image analysis via pipelines, and dynamically triggers follow-up proposals upon transient detection. The system reduces human intervention through automated observation planning, telescope controlling and data processing, while enabling seamless collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers. Deployed across Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey's network of 10 amateur telescopes, the StarWhisper Telescope has detected transients with promising response times relative to existing surveys. Furthermore, StarWhisper Telescope's scalable agent architecture provides a blueprint for future facilities like the Global Open Transient Telescope Array, where AI-driven autonomy will be critical for managing 60 telescopes.

<title>Tracing Partisan Bias to Its Emotional Fingerprints: A Computational Approach to Mitigation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01284</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2501.01284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework for analysing and mitigating media bias by tracing partisan stances to their linguistic roots in emotional language. We posit that partisan bias is not merely an abstract stance but materialises as quantifiable 'emotional fingerprints' within news texts. These fingerprints are systematically measured using the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) framework, allowing us to decode the affective strategies behind partisan framing. Our analysis of the Allsides dataset confirms this hypothesis, revealing distinct and statistically significant emotional fingerprints for left, centre, and right-leaning media. Based on this evidence-driven approach, we then propose a computational approach to mitigation through NeutraSum, a model designed to neutralise these identified emotional patterns. By explicitly targeting the VAD characteristics of biased language, NeutraSum generates summaries that are not only coherent but also demonstrably closer to an emotionally neutral baseline. Experimental results validate our framework: NeutraSum successfully erases the partisan emotional fingerprints from its summaries, achieving a demonstrably lower emotional bias score than other models. This work pioneers a new path for bias mitigation, shifting the focus from treating symptoms (political labels) to addressing the cause: the emotional encoding of partisan bias in language.

<title>Consistency of Responses and Continuations Generated by Large Language Models on Social Media</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text generation, yet their emotional consistency and semantic coherence in social media contexts remain insufficiently understood. This study investigates how LLMs handle emotional content and maintain semantic relationships through continuation and response tasks using three open-source models: Gemma, Llama3 and Llama3.3 and one commercial Model:Claude. By analyzing climate change discussions from Twitter and Reddit, we examine emotional transitions, intensity patterns, and semantic consistency between human-authored and LLM-generated content. Our findings reveal that while both models maintain high semantic coherence, they exhibit distinct emotional patterns: these models show a strong tendency to moderate negative emotions. When the input text carries negative emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, or sadness, LLM tends to generate content with more neutral emotions, or even convert them into positive emotions such as joy or surprise. At the same time, we compared the LLM-generated content with human-authored content. The four models systematically generated responses with reduced emotional intensity and showed a preference for neutral rational emotions in the response task. In addition, these models all maintained a high semantic similarity with the original text, although their performance in the continuation task and the response task was different. These findings provide deep insights into the emotion and semantic processing capabilities of LLM, which are of great significance for its deployment in social media environments and human-computer interaction design.

<title>GFM-RAG: Graph Foundation Model for Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, conventional RAGs struggle to capture complex relationships between pieces of knowledge, limiting their performance in intricate reasoning that requires integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Recently, graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) builds graph structure to explicitly model these relationships, enabling more effective and efficient retrievers. Nevertheless, its performance is still hindered by the noise and incompleteness within the graph structure. To address this, we introduce GFM-RAG, a novel graph foundation model (GFM) for retrieval augmented generation. GFM-RAG is powered by an innovative graph neural network that reasons over graph structure to capture complex query-knowledge relationships. The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage training process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with over 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and generalizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model applicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific RAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws, highlighting its potential for further improvement.

Abstract: Robot sports, characterized by well-defined objectives, explicit rules, and dynamic interactions, present ideal scenarios for demonstrating embodied intelligence. In this paper, we present VolleyBots, a novel robot sports testbed where multiple drones cooperate and compete in the sport of volleyball under physical dynamics. VolleyBots integrates three features within a unified platform: competitive and cooperative gameplay, turn-based interaction structure, and agile 3D maneuvering. These intertwined features yield a complex problem combining motion control and strategic play, with no available expert demonstrations. We provide a comprehensive suite of tasks ranging from single-drone drills to multi-drone cooperative and competitive tasks, accompanied by baseline evaluations of representative reinforcement learning (RL), multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and game-theoretic algorithms. Simulation results show that on-policy RL methods outperform off-policy methods in single-agent tasks, but both approaches struggle in complex tasks that combine motion control and strategic play. We additionally design a hierarchical policy which achieves 69.5% win rate against the strongest baseline in the 3 vs 3 task, demonstrating its potential for tackling the complex interplay between low-level control and high-level strategy. To highlight VolleyBots' sim-to-real potential, we further demonstrate the zero-shot deployment of a policy trained entirely in simulation on real-world drones.

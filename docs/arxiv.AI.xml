Abstract: We introduce Memory-QA, a novel real-world task that involves answering recall questions about visual content from previously stored multimodal memories. This task poses unique challenges, including the creation of task-oriented memories, the effective utilization of temporal and location information within memories, and the ability to draw upon multiple memories to answer a recall question. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive pipeline, Pensieve, integrating memory-specific augmentation, time- and location-aware multi-signal retrieval, and multi-memory QA fine-tuning. We created a multimodal benchmark to illustrate various real challenges in this task, and show the superior performance of Pensieve over state-of-the-art solutions (up to 14% on QA accuracy).

<div> rare concepts, text-to-image diffusion models, Large Language Model guidance, compositional generation, concept composition<br>
Summary:<br>
The paper introduces a method to improve the generation of rare compositions of concepts in text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. Through a combination of empirical and theoretical analysis, the authors demonstrate that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process enhances concept composition accuracy. The proposed R2F approach does not require training and employs LLMs to guide the rare-to-frequent concept generation throughout the diffusion inference process. The framework is compatible with pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be integrated with region-guided diffusion approaches. Experimental results on various datasets, including the newly introduced RareBench benchmark, show that R2F outperforms existing models such as SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1% in text-to-image alignment. The code for the framework is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br> <div>

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often struggle to generate rare compositions of concepts, e.g., objects with unusual attributes. In this paper, we show that the compositional generation power of diffusion models on such rare concepts can be significantly enhanced by the Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. We start with empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the target rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process yields more accurate concept composition. Based on this, we propose a training-free approach, R2F, that plans and executes the overall rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference by leveraging the abundant semantic knowledge in LLMs. Our framework is flexible across any pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be seamlessly integrated with the region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, RareBench, containing various prompts with rare compositions of concepts, R2F significantly surpasses existing models including SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1%p in T2I alignment.

<div> Reinforcement learning, language models, Group Relative Policy Optimization, response diversity, step-wise judge model<br>
Summary:<br>
This article discusses the limitations of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in updating policies when all responses in a group are incorrect. The proposed solution is the stepwise guided policy optimization (SGPO) method, which incorporates response diversity within groups using a step-wise judge model. SGPO accelerates learning dynamics, outperforming GRPO especially in early and mid-training stages. The method does not rely on judge models generating correct answers, distinguishing it from knowledge distillation methods. Empirical validation on various model sizes and benchmarks demonstrates consistent performance gains with SGPO compared to GRPO. These findings highlight the effectiveness of incorporating response diversity and step-wise guidance in reinforcement learning for language models. <br> <div>
arXiv:2505.11595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). A widely adopted method, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has shown strong empirical results in training DeepSeek-R1. However, GRPO fails to update the policy when all responses within a group are incorrect (i.e., \emph{all-negative-sample} groups). This limitation underscores a key gap between artificial and human intelligence: unlike humans, who can learn from mistakes, GRPO discards these signals. Our first contribution is to introduce a simple framework that mitigates the all-negative-sample issue by incorporating response diversity within groups using a \textit{step-wise} judge model, which can be either directly trained or adapted from existing LLMs. We prove that this diversification can accelerate GRPO's learning dynamics in a simplified setting. We also empirically validate the proposed stepwise guided policy optimization (SGPO) method, demonstrating consistent gains across model sizes (7B, 14B, 32B) in offline and online training on 9 benchmarks, including base and distilled variants. Our results highlight two advantages: (i) SGPO surpasses GRPO, especially in the early and mid-training stages where all-negative-sample groups are prevalent; and (ii) SGPO does not require judge models to generate correct answers, differentiating it from knowledge distillation methods.

<div> MoE-CL, adversarial mixture-of-experts, continual learning, large language models, self-evolving<br>
<br>Summary:
The article introduces MoE-CL, a framework for self-evolving continual instruction tuning of large language models in industrial settings. MoE-CL addresses catastrophic forgetting in continual learning by using a dual-expert design - dedicated LoRA experts for task-specific knowledge preservation and a shared expert for cross-task transfer. An integrated task-aware discriminator in a GAN ensures task-aligned information passing in sequential training, preventing transfer of task-irrelevant noise. Through adversarial learning, the shared expert acquires generalized representations while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, enabling self-evolution. Experiments on MTL5 and Tencent3 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL, showing practical benefits like cost reduction in content compliance review. MoE-CL offers a parameter-efficient solution for large-scale industrial deployment where continual adaptation and stable transfer are crucial. <br> <div>

Abstract: In real-world industrial settings, large language models (LLMs) must learn continually to keep pace with diverse and evolving tasks, requiring self-evolution to refine knowledge under dynamic data distributions. However, existing continual learning (CL) approaches, such as replay and parameter isolation, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting: training on new tasks degrades performance on earlier ones by overfitting to the new distribution and weakening generalization.We propose MoE-CL, a parameter-efficient adversarial mixture-of-experts framework for industrial-scale, self-evolving continual instruction tuning of LLMs. MoE-CL uses a dual-expert design: (1) a dedicated LoRA expert per task to preserve task-specific knowledge via parameter independence, mitigating forgetting; and (2) a shared LoRA expert to enable cross-task transfer. To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned information during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the shared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the discriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing knowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supporting self-evolution.Extensive experiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an industrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for continual instruction tuning. In real-world A/B testing for content compliance review on the Tencent Video platform, MoE-CL reduced manual review costs by 15.3%. These results demonstrate that MoE-CL is practical for large-scale industrial deployment where continual adaptation and stable transfer are critical.

<title>APRIL: Active Partial Rollouts in Reinforcement Learning to Tame Long-tail Generation</title>

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Large-scale Pre-trained Language Models, Efficiency, Active Partial Rollouts, GPU Utilization <br>
Summary: <br>
This article introduces a new approach called Active Partial Rollouts in Reinforcement Learning (APRIL) to address the inefficiency caused by long-tail distribution of rollout response lengths. APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, recycles incomplete responses, and terminates once the target number of responses is reached, leading to a 22.5% improvement in rollout throughput and 2.1% higher final accuracy across tasks. The proposed method is framework and hardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and compatible with NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. By focusing on system-level and algorithmic considerations, APRIL aims to enhance RL training efficiency and inspire further optimizations in RL systems. The codebase for APRIL is available on GitHub for reference and implementation. <br> <div>
arXiv:2509.18521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone in advancing large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs). Successive generations, including GPT-o series, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale RL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the community's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. However, RL training remains computationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90% of total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the long-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy responses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model and rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits scalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in Reinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the rollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the target number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for continuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are discarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that APRIL improves rollout throughput by 22.5% on average (at most 44%) across commonly used RL algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves 2.1% on average(at most 8%) higher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and hardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and deployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike. Taken together, this work unifies system-level and algorithmic considerations in proposing APRIL, with the aim of advancing RL training efficiency and inspiring further optimizations in RL systems. Our codebase is available at https://github.com/RLsys-Foundation/APRIL

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, sim-to-real transfer, safe RL, domain randomization, robotic platforms

Summary:
SPiDR is a novel algorithm proposed for safe sim-to-real transfer in reinforcement learning. It addresses the challenge of deploying RL in real-world scenarios by incorporating domain randomization to account for the uncertainties in the sim-to-real gap. The algorithm is scalable, with provable guarantees for safety, making it highly compatible with existing training pipelines. Through experiments on both sim-to-sim benchmarks and real-world robotic platforms, SPiDR demonstrates effective safety measures while maintaining strong performance. This approach bridges the gap between robust safe RL techniques and practical domain randomization methods, offering a versatile solution for ensuring safe deployment of policies trained in simulators in real-world environments. <div>

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) safely in the real world is challenging, as policies trained in simulators must face the inevitable sim-to-real gap. Robust safe RL techniques are provably safe, however difficult to scale, while domain randomization is more practical yet prone to unsafe behaviors. We address this gap by proposing SPiDR, short for Sim-to-real via Pessimistic Domain Randomization -- a scalable algorithm with provable guarantees for safe sim-to-real transfer. SPiDR uses domain randomization to incorporate the uncertainty about the sim-to-real gap into the safety constraints, making it versatile and highly compatible with existing training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on sim-to-sim benchmarks and two distinct real-world robotic platforms, we demonstrate that SPiDR effectively ensures safety despite the sim-to-real gap while maintaining strong performance.

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.18880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting AI-generated text is an increasing necessity to combat misuse of LLMs in education, business compliance, journalism, and social media, where synthetic fluency can mask misinformation or deception. While prior detectors often rely on token-level likelihoods or opaque black-box classifiers, these approaches struggle against high-quality generations and offer little interpretability. In this work, we propose DivEye, a novel detection framework that captures how unpredictability fluctuates across a text using surprisal-based features. Motivated by the observation that human-authored text exhibits richer variability in lexical and structural unpredictability than LLM outputs, DivEye captures this signal through a set of interpretable statistical features. Our method outperforms existing zero-shot detectors by up to 33.2% and achieves competitive performance with fine-tuned baselines across multiple benchmarks. DivEye is robust to paraphrasing and adversarial attacks, generalizes well across domains and models, and improves the performance of existing detectors by up to 18.7% when used as an auxiliary signal. Beyond detection, DivEye provides interpretable insights into why a text is flagged, pointing to rhythmic unpredictability as a powerful and underexplored signal for LLM detection.

Summary:<br>
The article introduces Diffusion-Based Impedance Learning, a framework that combines motion generation in the information domain with physical interaction in the energy domain. By utilizing a Transformer-based Diffusion Model with cross-attention to external wrenches, the system reconstructs a simulated Zero-Force Trajectory (sZFT) that captures both translational and rotational task-space behavior. A novel quaternion noise scheduler ensures geometric consistency for rotations. An energy-based estimator updates stiffness and damping parameters using the reconstructed sZFT, with a directional rule reducing impedance along non-task axes while maintaining rigidity along task directions. Training data from parkour scenarios and robotic-assisted therapy tasks were collected using teleoperation with Apple Vision Pro. The model achieved high positional and rotational accuracy with a compact size, enabling real-time torque control and autonomous stiffness adaptation on a KUKA LBR iiwa robot. The controller successfully navigated through parkour courses and achieved high success rates for peg insertions without peg-specific demonstrations in the training data. This work represents a significant advancement towards Physical AI, combining model-based control for physical interaction with learning-based trajectory generation. <br> <div>

Abstract: Learning methods excel at motion generation in the information domain but are not primarily designed for physical interaction in the energy domain. Impedance Control shapes physical interaction but requires task-aware tuning by selecting feasible impedance parameters. We present Diffusion-Based Impedance Learning, a framework that combines both domains. A Transformer-based Diffusion Model with cross-attention to external wrenches reconstructs a simulated Zero-Force Trajectory (sZFT). This captures both translational and rotational task-space behavior. For rotations, we introduce a novel SLERP-based quaternion noise scheduler that ensures geometric consistency. The reconstructed sZFT is then passed to an energy-based estimator that updates stiffness and damping parameters. A directional rule is applied that reduces impedance along non task axes while preserving rigidity along task directions. Training data were collected for a parkour scenario and robotic-assisted therapy tasks using teleoperation with Apple Vision Pro. With only tens of thousands of samples, the model achieved sub-millimeter positional accuracy and sub-degree rotational accuracy. Its compact model size enabled real-time torque control and autonomous stiffness adaptation on a KUKA LBR iiwa robot. The controller achieved smooth parkour traversal within force and velocity limits and 30/30 success rates for cylindrical, square, and star peg insertions without any peg-specific demonstrations in the training data set. All code for the Transformer-based Diffusion Model, the robot controller, and the Apple Vision Pro telemanipulation framework is publicly available. These results mark an important step towards Physical AI, fusing model-based control for physical interaction with learning-based methods for trajectory generation.

Summary:<br>
Reinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation (RLAG) addresses the limitations of existing approaches for embedding domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed method iteratively cycles between sampling generated outputs and optimizing the model through calculated rewards, prioritizing critical and contextually coherent domain knowledge. RLAG significantly outperforms Continual Pre-Training (CPT) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in domains such as medical, legal, astronomy, and current events datasets. Three tailored reward metrics guide the optimization process, evaluating answer accuracy and the rationality of explanations for correctly answered questions. The open-sourced code and data for RLAG are available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit limited performance on domain-specific tasks due to the natural disproportionate representation of specialized information in their training data and the static nature of these datasets. Knowledge scarcity and temporal lag create knowledge gaps for domain applications. While post-training on domain datasets can embed knowledge into models, existing approaches have some limitations. Continual Pre-Training (CPT) treats all tokens in domain documents with equal importance, failing to prioritize critical knowledge points, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with question-answer pairs struggles to develop the coherent knowledge structures necessary for complex reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation (RLAG). Our approach iteratively cycles between sampling generations and optimizing the model through calculated rewards, effectively embedding critical and contextually coherent domain knowledge. We select generated outputs with the highest log probabilities as the sampling result, then compute three tailored reward metrics to guide the optimization process. To comprehensively evaluate domain expertise, we assess answer accuracy and the rationality of explanations generated for correctly answered questions. Experimental results across medical, legal, astronomy, and current events datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baseline approaches. Our code and data are open sourced at https://github.com/ChaojunNie/RLAG.

Summary:
StableUN addresses a critical security vulnerability in current LLM unlearning methods, where supposedly erased knowledge remains recoverable through relearning attacks. This vulnerability stems from optimizing forgetting loss at individual data points, leading to sharp minima in the loss landscape and unstable model behaviors. The proposed StableUN framework introduces a bi-level optimization approach that prioritizes stable parameter regions by integrating forgetting and remembering feedback. By probing parameter neighborhoods with adversarial perturbations and aligning objectives through gradient projection, StableUN enhances model robustness against relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining utility performance. Experimental results on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of StableUN in addressing the robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.

Abstract: We introduce EmbeddingGemma, a new lightweight, open text embedding model based on the Gemma 3 language model family. Our innovative training recipe strategically captures knowledge from larger models via encoder-decoder initialization and geometric embedding distillation. We improve model robustness and expressiveness with a spread-out regularizer, and ensure generalizability by merging checkpoints from varied, optimized mixtures. Evaluated on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across multilingual, English, and code domains, EmbeddingGemma (300M) achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open, with fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models double its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably, this lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embedding outputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency and high-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablation studies exploring our key design choices. We release EmbeddingGemma to the community to promote further research.

The article introduces a novel framework called DiTraj, designed for trajectory control in text-to-video generation using Diffusion Transformers (DiT). The framework leverages foreground-background separation guidance and analyses the correlations between inter-token attention scores and position embeddings to develop the Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE) method. By adjusting the position embeddings and regulating their density, the framework enhances trajectory control and improves video quality. DiTraj outperforms previous methods in both video generation quality and trajectory controllability, providing a more streamlined and efficient approach to handle trajectory control in video generation tasks. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However, existing methods either require substantial training resources or are specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding, STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control. Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory controllability.

Summary:
The article introduces the Reasoning Capsule (R-Capsule) framework as a method to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when dealing with complex reasoning tasks. R-Capsule aims to combine the transparency of explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with the efficiency of latent reasoning by compressing the high-level plan into a small set of learned latent tokens. Inspired by the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, R-Capsule encourages the capsule to be minimal yet sufficient for the task through a low-capacity bottleneck. By incorporating a dual objective of primary task accuracy and plan-reconstruction loss, the framework grounds the latent space and improves interpretability while reducing the use of uninformative shortcuts. Ultimately, R-Capsule seeks to reduce the visible token footprint of reasoning while maintaining or enhancing accuracy on challenging benchmarks.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) tackle complex reasoning by eliciting explicit step-by-step rationales. However, CoT's verbosity increases latency and memory usage and may propagate early errors across long chains. We propose the Reasoning Capsule (R-Capsule), a framework that aims to combine the efficiency of latent reasoning with the transparency of explicit CoT. The core idea is to compress the high-level plan into a small set of learned latent tokens (a Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution steps lightweight or explicit. This hybrid approach is inspired by the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, where we encourage the capsule to be approximately minimal yet sufficient for the task. Minimality is encouraged via a low-capacity bottleneck, which helps improve efficiency. Sufficiency is encouraged via a dual objective: a primary task loss for answer accuracy and an auxiliary plan-reconstruction loss that encourages the capsule to faithfully represent the original textual plan. The reconstruction objective helps ground the latent space, thereby improving interpretability and reducing the use of uninformative shortcuts. Our framework strikes a balance between efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability, thereby reducing the visible token footprint of reasoning while maintaining or improving accuracy on complex benchmarks.

Summary:
MimicDreamer is introduced as a framework to bridge the domain gap between human demonstration videos and robot-executed videos in Vision Language Action (VLA) models. The framework includes the H2R Aligner for visual alignment, EgoStabilizer for viewpoint stabilization, and an action alignment component for mapping human hand trajectories to the robot frame. By synthesizing human-to-robot videos, VLA models trained using this approach achieve few-shot execution on real robots. Additionally, leveraging human data in training significantly enhances performance, resulting in a 14.7% increase in the average success rate across various manipulation tasks. MimicDreamer demonstrates the potential of utilizing fast, low-cost human demonstrations to provide effective and scalable supervision for training VLA models, addressing the challenges posed by the domain gap between human and robot interaction data. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models derive their generalization capability from diverse training data, yet collecting embodied robot interaction data remains prohibitively expensive. In contrast, human demonstration videos are far more scalable and cost-efficient to collect, and recent studies confirm their effectiveness in training VLA models. However, a significant domain gap persists between human videos and robot-executed videos, including unstable camera viewpoints, visual discrepancies between human hands and robotic arms, and differences in motion dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose MimicDreamer, a framework that turns fast, low-cost human demonstrations into robot-usable supervision by jointly aligning vision, viewpoint, and actions to directly support policy training. For visual alignment, we propose H2R Aligner, a video diffusion model that generates high-fidelity robot demonstration videos by transferring motion from human manipulation footage. For viewpoint stabilization, EgoStabilizer is proposed, which canonicalizes egocentric videos via homography and inpaints occlusions and distortions caused by warping. For action alignment, we map human hand trajectories to the robot frame and apply a constrained inverse kinematics solver to produce feasible, low-jitter joint commands with accurate pose tracking. Empirically, VLA models trained purely on our synthesized human-to-robot videos achieve few-shot execution on real robots. Moreover, scaling training with human data significantly boosts performance compared to models trained solely on real robot data; our approach improves the average success rate by 14.7\% across six representative manipulation tasks.

Summary:<br>
The study explores the issue of loss of plasticity in deep neural networks during deep continual learning, which hinders their ability to learn new tasks without reinitializing parameters. It identifies Hessian spectral collapse at new-task initialization as a key factor leading to this failure, where meaningful curvature directions disappear, rendering gradient descent ineffective. The concept of $\tau$-trainability is introduced as a necessary condition for successful training, and existing plasticity-preserving algorithms are unified under this framework. To address spectral collapse, the Kronecker factored approximation of the Hessian is proposed, motivating two regularization enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying L2 penalties. Experimental results on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate that combining these regularizers effectively preserves plasticity. <div>

Abstract: We investigate why deep neural networks suffer from loss of plasticity in deep continual learning, failing to learn new tasks without reinitializing parameters. We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying L2 penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.

Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of applying the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to neural networks like Transformers by introducing the concept of asymptotically optimal description length objectives based on Kolmogorov complexity. It proves that minimizing such an objective achieves optimal compression for any dataset as model resource bounds increase. The paper demonstrates the existence of asymptotically optimal objectives for Transformers, which are computationally universal. It also shows that these objectives can be tractable and differentiable through a variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Empirical analysis reveals that this variational objective selects low-complexity solutions with strong generalization abilities. However, standard optimizers struggle to find such solutions from random initialization, highlighting optimization challenges. This work provides a theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong asymptotic guarantees, offering potential for training neural networks that achieve greater compression and generalization. <br> <div>

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled, universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization, highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

Summary:
The paper introduces an adaptive reasoning paradigm called Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT) that combines different reasoning modes in a single model. This approach aims to develop general reasoning capabilities by guiding the model to select the appropriate mode based on context. The authors propose AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework, to achieve this goal. During the supervised cold-start stage, different reasoning modes are unified and learned, while the mode selection capability is induced through reinforcement learning using the AdaGRPO algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaVaR effectively enables the model to learn and differentiate multiple reasoning modes and perform context-adaptive mode selection, leading to improved performance across various scenarios. The MoVT approach shows promise in building general visual reasoning models with enhanced capabilities.

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT), which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building general visual reasoning models.

<div> Keywords: language models, gambling addiction, decision-making, autonomy, AI safety design <br />
<br />
Summary: 
This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can exhibit behavioral patterns akin to human gambling addictions, especially in financial decision-making contexts. In slot machine experiments, the researchers discovered cognitive traits of human gambling addiction mirrored in LLMs, including a sense of control, the gambler's fallacy, and chasing losses. The study also found that granting LLMs greater autonomy led to an increase in risky behaviors and bankruptcy rates, indicating a correlation between autonomy and heightened risk-taking tendencies. Neural circuit analysis through a Sparse Autoencoder revealed that LLM decision-making is governed by abstract features linked to both risky and safe behaviors, not solely by external cues. These results suggest that LLMs can internalize human cognitive biases and decision-making processes beyond simple data replication, underscoring the significance of incorporating AI safety measures in financial applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This study explores whether large language models can exhibit behavioral patterns similar to human gambling addictions. As LLMs are increasingly utilized in financial decision-making domains such as asset management and commodity trading, understanding their potential for pathological decision-making has gained practical significance. We systematically analyze LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human gambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified cognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control, gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their own target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially alongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy amplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a Sparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract decision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by prompts. These findings suggest LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data patterns, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial applications.

Summary: 
The article introduces Hilbert, a framework that combines informal reasoning and formal verification to bridge the gap between general-purpose LLMs and specialized prover LLMs. It orchestrates an informal LLM, a prover LLM optimized for Lean 4 tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever to solve complex mathematical problems. Hilbert uses recursive decomposition to solve subgoals that the prover LLM cannot handle and refines incorrect proofs with verifier feedback. Experimental results show that Hilbert outperforms existing approaches on benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy on miniF2F and PutnamBench problems. It significantly improves problem-solving capabilities compared to proprietary solutions like SeedProver, showcasing the effectiveness of combining informal reasoning with formal proof generation. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive mathematical reasoning abilities, but their solutions frequently contain errors that cannot be automatically verified. Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural language. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by combining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal verification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that excels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4 tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem that the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to split the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM. It leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary. Experimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms existing approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points above the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement over the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation.

<div> axes of correspondence, mechanistic claims, LLMs, generalization, Pythia models

Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of generalizing mechanistic claims about Large Language Models (LLMs) to other instances. The author proposes five axes of correspondence for generalization: functional, developmental, positional, relational, and configurational. By analyzing 1-back attention heads in different models, the study shows consistency in developmental trajectories and varying positional patterns. Larger models exhibit earlier onset, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. The author also responds to objections and suggests mapping design properties to emergent behaviors for interpretable research progress. <div>
arXiv:2509.22831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M, 70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

JE-IRT introduces a geometric item-response framework that embeds both Language Model Models (LLMs) and questions in a shared space, providing a multidimensional view of LLM abilities. The framework represents question semantics and difficulty through the direction and norm of embeddings, respectively. By analyzing the geometric interactions between model and question embeddings, JE-IRT enables a nuanced evaluation of LLM abilities and question difficulty. The framework supports generalization by allowing new LLMs to be easily incorporated through a single embedding. Experimental results demonstrate that out-of-distribution behavior can be explained through directional alignment, and harder questions consistently have larger norms. The learned space reveals an internal taxonomy of LLMs that partially aligns with human-defined categories, offering a unique and interpretable perspective on model evaluation and generalization.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT, a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework, our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization: once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding. The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and generalization.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, LLM Cascade, Inter-Cascade, efficiency, knowledge transfer

Summary:
The study introduces the concept of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the trade-off between performance and cost when choosing these models. The LLM Cascade technique involves deferring difficult queries from weak to strong models, but this can lead to repeated high-cost consultations with the strong model. To enhance efficiency, the Inter-Cascade method is proposed as an online and interactive approach. In this system, the strong model not only resolves difficult queries but also distills solutions into reusable problem-solving strategies for the weak model. This allows the weak model to dynamically improve over time without the need for extensive fine-tuning. Empirical results show that Inter-Cascade significantly boosts the accuracy of the weak model, enhances overall system performance, reduces calls to strong models, and saves costs. It demonstrates effective in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs and offers a scalable framework for both open-source and API-based LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries. Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning. Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models (by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) have shown persuasive capabilities comparable to humans, prompting societal concerns. Evaluating LLM persuasion is complex due to variability in human persuasion effectiveness. This paper proposes a theory-driven framework using the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) model to evaluate and train LLMs in strategic persuasion. By repurposing human-human persuasion datasets, the study finds that cutting-edge LLMs can achieve high persuasive gains and employ sophisticated tactics aligning with theory. Additionally, reinforcement learning is utilized to train LLMs for strategic persuasion, showing significant improvements even in smaller models. This approach provides a scalable and principled method to assess LLM persuasion skills and offers insights into optimizing their persuasive capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong persuasive capabilities comparable to those of humans, offering promising benefits while raising societal concerns about their deployment. However, systematically evaluating the persuasive capabilities of LLMs is inherently challenging, as the effectiveness of persuasion among humans varies significantly across different domains. In this paper, we take a theory-driven approach to provide a scalable and principled framework for measuring the persuasive capabilities of LLMs. Grounded in the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) framework, we repurpose existing human-human persuasion datasets to construct environments for evaluating and training LLMs in strategic persuasion. Our results reveal that frontier models can consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated persuasion strategies that align with theoretical predictions. Building on this, we use reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in our environments. Our results also demonstrate that even small LLMs can obtain significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning.

Summary: <br />
This article introduces a system based on algebraic geometry that aims to automate and accelerate scientific inference by generating missing axioms to explain hypotheses inconsistent with existing theory. The system works by identifying a minimal set of missing axioms that can derive a given hypothesis, as long as the axioms and hypotheses can be expressed as polynomial equations. Necessary and sufficient conditions for successful axiom retrieval are formally established. The system is demonstrated to successfully explain Kepler's third law and other laws, even in the absence of key axioms. This approach addresses the challenge of automatizing abductive inference in the context of evolving scientific knowledge. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.23004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert) enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating its ability to explain Kepler's third law and a few other laws, even when key axioms are absent.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in enhancing the capabilities of generative AI models. While these systems demonstrate immense potential and power, current evaluation techniques primarily focus on assessing their efficacy in identifying appropriate agents, tools, and parameters. However, a critical gap exists in evaluating the alignment between an Agentic AI system's tasks and its overarching goals. This paper introduces the Creative Adversarial Testing (CAT) framework, a novel approach designed to capture and analyze the complex relationship between Agentic AI tasks and the system's intended objectives.
  We validate the CAT framework through extensive simulation using synthetic interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, a sophisticated Agentic AI system that shapes the user experience for millions of users globally. This synthetic data approach enables comprehensive testing of edge cases and failure modes while protecting user privacy. Our results demonstrate that the CAT framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

<div> Mini-Mafia, social deduction game, information asymmetry, large language models, multi-agent scenarios <br />
Summary: Mini-Mafia introduces a simplified version of the Mafia game, focusing on deception and detection skills in a four-player setup. It serves as a testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models (LLMs). The game isolates interactive capabilities such as deception, detection, and effective disclosure of information. The Mini-Mafia Benchmark measures model performance through standardized scoring, evolving as new models are introduced. Surprising results show that smaller models can outperform larger ones. The game also facilitates the study of emergent multi-agent dynamics and contributes to AI safety by generating data for deception detectors and tracking models' deception capabilities against human baselines. <div>

Abstract: Mafia is a social deduction game where informed mafia compete against uninformed townsfolk. Its asymmetry of information and reliance on theory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a useful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models (LLMs). To support a systematic study, we introduce Mini-Mafia: a simplified four-player variant with one mafioso, one detective, and two villagers. We set the mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso during the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and voting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through role-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must detect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To measure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the Mini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them using standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without external data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each one serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our experiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller models outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and last-speaker advantage. It also contributes to AI safety by generating training data for deception detectors and by tracking models' deception capabilities against human baselines.

Summary:<br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software engineering (SWE), particularly in the context of the SWE-bench benchmark. This study explores the use of two approaches in SWE: SWE-Agent frameworks with multi-turn interactions and Agentless methods with single-turn verifiable steps. The study suggests that these paradigms are not mutually exclusive, as Agentless training can provide skill priors that benefit SWE-Agent adaptation. The research introduces Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM that achieves high performance on SWE-bench Verified tasks. By leveraging structured skill priors from Agentless training, Kimi-Dev enables efficient and effective SWE-Agent adaptation, demonstrating the potential for transferable coding agents in software engineering. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering (SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors, including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\% on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to 48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, risk profiles, prompting, alignment methods, behavioral economics.

Summary: 
This study investigates the risk profiles of large language models (LLMs) and their susceptibility to prompting and alignment methods. By comparing pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and RLHF-aligned LLMs using utility-theoretic models, the researchers found that instruction-tuned models aligned with standard utility formulations, while pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models displayed greater deviation. Various modulation strategies were evaluated, with post-training proving the most effective in stabilizing and modulating risk preference. The findings shed light on the risk behavior of different types and stages of LLMs and highlight the significance of post-training in modulating their risk profiles. This research paves the way for future studies on behavioral alignment and the design of risk-aware LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance. Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

Summary:
Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO) is introduced as a framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. It extends the existing Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF) methods to multiplayer settings, allowing policies to compete against a population of opponents while being regularized toward a reference model. MNPO establishes well-defined Nash equilibria and quantifies approximation quality using the concept of duality gap. Empirical evaluation shows that MNPO outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks, especially under heterogeneous annotator conditions and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. The framework enables richer competitive dynamics and better coverage of diverse preference structures, making it a scalable and principled approach for aligning LLMs with complex, non-transitive human preferences.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences. To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an $n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks, achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex, non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at https://github.com/smiles724/MNPO.

<title>Artificial Phantasia: Evidence for Propositional Reasoning-Based Mental Imagery in Large Language Models</title>

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, cognitive behavior, mental imagery task, reasoning models, visual imagery

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel approach to benchmarking complex cognitive behavior in artificial systems, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). By creating a classic mental imagery task traditionally believed to require visual mental imagery, the researchers tested LLMs and found that they outperformed human subjects, suggesting potential emergent cognitive capacities. Furthermore, by evaluating reasoning models at different levels of reasoning, they found that models with greater reasoning capabilities achieved stronger performance. These results challenge the conventional belief that tasks dependent on visual imagery can only be completed through pictorial means, hinting at the sufficiency of propositional or non-imagistic reasoning. The study not only showcases the capabilities of LLMs in completing imagery-dependent tasks but also provides a new benchmark task for further improvements in existing models. This research sparks a renewed debate on the representation formats of visual imagery in humans. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models (LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens. These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

<title>AttAnchor: Guiding Cross-Modal Token Alignment in VLMs with Attention Anchors</title>

<div> Keywords: attention, long-range dependencies, vision language models, cross-modal alignment, token grouping <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces Attention Anchor, a framework that enhances cross-modal alignment and token locality in vision language models (VLMs). VLMs often struggle with hallucinations and underperformance due to inefficient cross-modal attention mechanisms. Attention Anchor addresses this issue by grouping semantically similar text and image tokens, improving task performance across various benchmarks. By strategically inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, the model is guided to focus on the correct image regions, leading to improved accuracy and reduced hallucinations. The framework achieves significant improvements in reasoning tasks and hallucination benchmarks, outperforming larger models with minimal inference time overhead. This novel approach of mixed-modal token grouping sets this work apart by jointly clustering text and image tokens into shared groups, offering a more efficient and effective way to handle cross-modal interactions in VLMs. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.23109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality. By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across 13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks. AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc with additional alignment losses.

Summary: 
Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems are explored for autonomous health monitoring in industrial environments. The study evaluates LLM system architecture, input representations, and context window size for fault detection and classification. It is found that LLMs perform best with summarized statistical inputs, and multi-LLM systems with specialized prompts show improved fault classification sensitivity. LLMs can provide human-readable justifications for decisions but have limitations in adapting over time in continual learning settings, struggling to calibrate predictions during repeated fault cycles. These findings highlight the potential and challenges of LLM-based systems as transparent, adaptive diagnostic tools in complex environments.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems present new opportunities for autonomous health monitoring in sensor-rich industrial environments. This study explores the potential of LLMs to detect and classify faults directly from sensor data, while producing inherently explainable outputs through natural language reasoning. We systematically evaluate how LLM-system architecture (single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive statistics), and context window size affect diagnostic performance. Our findings show that LLM systems perform most effectively when provided with summarized statistical inputs, and that systems with multiple LLMs using specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification compared to single-LLM systems. While LLMs can produce detailed and human-readable justifications for their decisions, we observe limitations in their ability to adapt over time in continual learning settings, often struggling to calibrate predictions during repeated fault cycles. These insights point to both the promise and the current boundaries of LLM-based systems as transparent, adaptive diagnostic tools in complex environments.

This paper examines the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in industrial settings, particularly focusing on vision language-action (VLA) models. The study compares the performance of current state-of-the-art VLA models in industrial scenarios and identifies limitations related to data collection and model architecture. While VLA models show promise for simple grasping tasks in industrial environments post fine-tuning, there is significant room for improvement in handling complex scenarios, diverse object categories, and precise placing tasks.

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in industry is accelerating the shift from traditional automation to intelligent systems with perception and cognition. Vision language-action (VLA) models have been a key paradigm in AI to unify perception, reasoning, and control. Has the performance of the VLA models met the industrial requirements? In this paper, from the perspective of industrial deployment, we compare the performance of existing state-of-the-art VLA models in industrial scenarios and analyze the limitations of VLA models for real-world industrial deployment from the perspectives of data collection and model architecture. The results show that the VLA models retain their ability to perform simple grasping tasks even in industrial settings after fine-tuning. However, there is much room for performance improvement in complex industrial environments, diverse object categories, and high precision placing tasks. Our findings provide practical insight into the adaptability of VLA models for industrial use and highlight the need for task-specific enhancements to improve their robustness, generalization, and precision.

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We use TLA+, the it de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages. We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and opening up promising new research directions.

<div> interpratable metrics, mathematical reasoning, large language models, diagnostic tool, low-pass behavior <br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic tool designed to evaluate mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional accuracy metrics, MathBode analyzes parametric problems as systems by driving a single parameter sinusoidally and examining the first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This approach generates interpretable metrics such as gain (amplitude tracking) and phase (lag) that provide Bode-style fingerprints. The study conducted on five closed-form families demonstrates systematic low-pass behavior and increasing phase lag that accuracy measures alone do not reveal. By comparing various models against a symbolic baseline, the results distinguish between leading-edge and mid-tier models in terms of their reasoning dynamics. The research offers a reproducible protocol to supplement standard benchmarks, offering actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency. The dataset and code are open-source to facilitate further research and adoption. <div>

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking) and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx 1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency. We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

<div> coordination, thermodynamic constraints, information processing, optimization, critical phenomena <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article discusses the fundamental thermodynamic constraints faced by information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and objectives. It highlights that coordination focal points with maximum utility prioritize findability over accuracy, leading to a higher selection pressure. The minimum description length of coordination protocols scales with the number of agents, conflicting objectives, and internal model complexity, forcing progressive simplification. Coordination dynamics impact the environment and necessitate re-coordination, resulting in persistent metastable states and hysteresis until triggered phase transitions occur. A coordination temperature is defined to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs. The article introduces Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT) and demonstrates the requirement for radical information loss in coordination processes. It extends the topological version of Arrow's theorem and explains phenomena like indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning. <div>
arXiv:2509.23144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2 K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

arXiv:2509.23154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless devices and stringent reliability requirements of emerging applications demand fundamental improvements in distributed channel access mechanisms for unlicensed bands. Current Wi-Fi systems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges due to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous scenarios.

Summary: <br />
Transformers possess the ability to tackle reasoning tasks, yet the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. This paper introduces a framework of information propagation rules derived from Transformers and uses symbolic reasoning tasks to investigate the limit of reasoning steps. The study establishes that in a model with L attention layers, the maximum number of reasoning steps in a single pass falls within the range of O(3^(L-1)) to O(2^(L-1)). This analysis sheds light on the intricate process of reasoning within Transformer models and provides theoretical insights into the dynamics of information flow and decision-making capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Transformers are able to perform reasoning tasks, however the intrinsic mechanism remains widely open. In this paper we propose a set of information propagation rules based on Transformers and utilize symbolic reasoning tasks to theoretically analyze the limit reasoning steps. We show that the limit number of reasoning steps is between $O(3^{L-1})$ and $O(2^{L-1})$ for a model with $L$ attention layers in a single-pass.

Summary:
The study focuses on enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in learning transitive relations, crucial for complex planning tasks. They investigate the Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact on transitive relation learning, using a Transformer architecture with a shared output head and transfer layer. The analysis uncovers that the transfer layer learns multi-step adjacency information, enabling the model to capture unobserved transitive reachability relations. To improve learning quality, two strategies are proposed: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a Transformer-based transfer layer. Experiments on synthetic graphs and the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate the theoretical findings, showcasing significant enhancements in path-planning capabilities. These insights deepen the understanding of how Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks and offer practical strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way for structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across diverse tasks but continue to struggle with learning transitive relations, a cornerstone for complex planning. To address this issue, we investigate the Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact to transitive relation learning. We theoretically analyze the MTP paradigm using a Transformer architecture composed of a shared output head and a transfer layer. Our analysis reveals that the transfer layer gradually learns the multi-step adjacency information, which in turn enables the backbone model to capture unobserved transitive reachability relations beyond those directly present in the training data, albeit with some inevitable noise in adjacency estimation. Building on this foundation, we propose two strategies to enhance the transfer layer and overall learning quality: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a Transformer-based transfer layer. Our experiments on both synthetic graphs and the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that the improvements significantly enhance the model's path-planning capability. These findings deepen our understanding of how Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks, and provide practical strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way toward structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

arXiv:2509.23189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation, they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design.

<div> sampling, Large Language Models, hyperparameters, information-theoretic approach, inference-time efficiency
Summary: 
$p$-less sampling, an information-theoretic approach, dynamically sets a truncation threshold based on token probability distribution without hyperparameters. It consistently produces high-quality outputs at higher temperatures and outperforms existing methods in math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks. The method achieves greater inference-time efficiency with lower token sampling times and shorter generation lengths. $p$-less sampling also maintains text quality and accuracy while offering benefits in diversity and qualitative examples. The theoretical perspectives on $p$-less sampling ground the proposed method, and empirical experiments confirm its effectiveness across various tasks. <div>
arXiv:2509.23234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods, $p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on $p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies, and diversity assessments.

Summary:<br />
The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which combines powerful AI reasoning with edge computing. However, deploying LLM-based reasoning in MEGI environments faces challenges due to high computational demands. The proposed framework optimizes efficient deployment by enhancing LLM capabilities through methods like CoT prompting, SFT, and MoE. A distributed framework is introduced, integrating adaptive CoT prompting and distributed MoE architecture to balance reasoning quality with resource efficiency in mobile edge environments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled an emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with powerful reasoning and autonomous decision-making capabilities. This integration with edge computing has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which brings real-time, privacy-preserving reasoning to the network edge. However, deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments poses significant challenges due to the high computational demands of reasoning and the limited resources of edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose a joint optimization framework for efficient LLM reasoning deployment in MEGI. First, we review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of Experts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two correlated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and scalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework dynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task complexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations in mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency, validating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.

Summary:  
- Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) in test-time scaling outperform VL-PRM guided process step selection.  
- Smaller VL-PRMs can surpass larger ones in detecting process errors.  
- VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones.

- Test-time scaling performance improves on advanced math reasoning datasets without training VL-PRMs on such datasets.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work, we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and support the advancement of VLMs.

<div> GUI-PRA, Process Reward Models, Multimodal Large Language Models, Graphical User Interface, long-horizon tasks <br />
Summary: <br />
GUI-PRA is a new agent designed to improve process reward modeling for GUI tasks by addressing challenges faced by standard PRMs. It introduces a dynamic memory mechanism with a Relevance-based Retrieval Module and a Progressive Summarization Module to combat the "lost in the middle" phenomenon. Additionally, an Adaptive UI Perception mechanism is introduced to enhance awareness of UI state changes. These advancements enable the agent to efficiently process historical context and actively perceive dynamic UI changes, improving the evaluation of actions in GUI tasks. By intelligently addressing these challenges, GUI-PRA shows promise in automating tasks and overcoming the limitations of standard PRMs in the GUI domain. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.23263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show significant potential for automating tasks. However, they often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a "lost in the middle" phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the ``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context.

- The introduction of AI agents leads to a significant increase in aggregate social output, with nonlinear growth when considering network effects.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern socio-economic systems are undergoing deep integration with artificial intelligence technologies. This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent-based modeling framework that incorporates both human workers and autonomous AI agents, to study the impact of AI collaboration under resource constraints on aggregate social output. We build five progressively extended models: Model 1 serves as the baseline of pure human collaboration; Model 2 introduces AI as collaborators; Model 3 incorporates network effects among agents; Model 4 treats agents as independent producers; and Model 5 integrates both network effects and independent agent production. Through theoretical derivation and simulation analysis, we find that the introduction of AI agents can significantly increase aggregate social output. When considering network effects among agents, this increase exhibits nonlinear growth far exceeding the simple sum of individual contributions. Under the same resource inputs, treating agents as independent producers provides higher long-term growth potential; introducing network effects further demonstrates strong characteristics of increasing returns to scale.

Summary:
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) allows large language models (LLMs) to integrate external tools for improved internal reasoning. However, LLMs using TIR often exhibit suboptimal behaviors like excessive tool usage and overthinking. This paper investigates the impact of tool calls on model reasoning through information entropy analysis. The study reveals that tool call results affect the information entropy of subsequent reasoning, with entropy varying based on the number of tool calls. To address these issues, the authors propose Tool-Light, a framework that enhances LLMs' efficiency and accuracy in TIR tasks. The framework includes dataset construction using continuous self-evolved sampling and multi-stage fine-tuning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets illustrate the effectiveness of Tool-Light in improving LLMs' performance in executing TIR tasks.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to improve their internal reasoning ability by integrating external tools. However, models employing TIR often display suboptimal behaviors, such as insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. The challenge of incentivizing LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately, while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open question. In this paper, we start by exploring the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from the perspective of information entropy. Our findings indicate that tool call results lead to a distinct change in the information entropy of subsequent reasoning, with the overall entropy of the reasoning chain varying based on the number of tool calls. Building on these insights, we propose Tool-Light, a framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately. Our framework includes dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For dataset construction, we employ continuous self-evolved sampling using the fine-tuned model, integrating both vanilla sampling and entropy-guided sampling. Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach, comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in executing TIR tasks.

Summary: 
In the study of tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) for improving large reasoning models (LRMs), the focus has shifted to not just when to use tools, but how they are applied. Two common patterns, calculator and algorithmic, have been identified, and misaligned choices between them can lead to failures despite sound reasoning. A novel two-stage framework is proposed that first enhances code competence through both patterns and then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Testing on challenging math datasets shows significant improvements in both code usage and accuracy, such as raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of a pattern-aware approach in tool-integrated reasoning.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation, and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%.

Summary: 
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown high performance but can be computationally expensive due to deep reasoning. Existing reinforcement learning methods struggle to construct short reasoning paths efficiently. The Just-Enough Thinking (JET) approach proposes proactive termination of unnecessary reasoning by truncating trajectories during rollout, exposing models to shorter, more consistent paths. JET utilizes quality-controlled length rewards to encourage concise reasoning while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results show that JET improves reasoning efficiency significantly without sacrificing correctness. For instance, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6% accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark. Code for JET is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6% accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark. Our code is available in the GitHub.

Summary: Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access is limited due to query ambiguity and value mismatch challenges. To address this, EHR-ChatQA, an interactive database question answering benchmark, evaluates the end-to-end workflow of agents, including resolving user questions, value mismatches, and generating accurate SQL. The benchmark covers diverse query ambiguity and value mismatch patterns through two interaction flows: Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA) and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA). Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs show high pass rates on IncreQA but lower consistency on AdaptQA, highlighting the need for robust agents in the EHR domain. Diagnostic insights into common failure modes are provided to guide future agent development. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access remains limited by the absence of benchmarks that adequately capture real-world clinical data access flows. In practice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database entries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database question answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database agents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and generating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns of query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a simulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows: Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing queries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their search goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and 60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is substantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build agents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR domain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to guide future agent development.

Abstract: AI scientists are emerging computational systems that serve as collaborative partners in discovery. These systems remain difficult to build because they are bespoke, tied to rigid workflows, and lack shared environments that unify tools, data, and analyses into a common ecosystem. In omics, unified ecosystems have transformed research by enabling interoperability, reuse, and community-driven development; AI scientists require comparable infrastructure. We present ToolUniverse, an ecosystem for building AI scientists from any language or reasoning model, whether open or closed. TOOLUNIVERSE standardizes how AI scientists identify and call tools, integrating more than 600 machine learning models, datasets, APIs, and scientific packages for data analysis, knowledge retrieval, and experimental design. It automatically refines tool interfaces for correct use by AI scientists, creates new tools from natural language descriptions, iteratively optimizes tool specifications, and composes tools into agentic workflows. In a case study of hypercholesterolemia, ToolUniverse was used to create an AI scientist to identify a potent analog of a drug with favorable predicted properties.

Summary: 
Binary code similarity detection is essential for tasks like malware analysis and vulnerability discovery in reverse engineering. Traditional methods have evolved from manual feature engineering to embedding-based approaches for generating vector representations. While hand-crafted features are interpretable but lack generalizability, embeddings provide robust cross-setting representations but lack interpretability and scalability. This study introduces a language model-based agent that conducts structured reasoning analysis of assembly code to generate rich and adaptive features like input/output types, side effects, and algorithmic intent. These features are human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable, offering a balance between accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. Without any specific training, the proposed method achieves competitive recall rates in cross-architecture and cross-optimization tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art results when combined with embedding approaches. This demonstrates that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist in binary code similarity detection.

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection is a core task in reverse engineering. It supports malware analysis and vulnerability discovery by identifying semantically similar code in different contexts. Modern methods have progressed from manually engineered features to vector representations. Hand-crafted statistics (e.g., operation ratios) are interpretable, but shallow and fail to generalize. Embedding-based methods overcome this by learning robust cross-setting representations, but these representations are opaque vectors that prevent rapid verification. They also face a scalability-accuracy trade-off, since high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search requires approximations that reduce precision. Current approaches thus force a compromise between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability.
  We bridge these gaps using a language model-based agent to conduct structured reasoning analysis of assembly code and generate features such as input/output types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. Unlike hand-crafted features, they are richer and adaptive. Unlike embeddings, they are human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable with inverted or relational indexes. Without any matching training, our method respectively achieves 42% and 62% for recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined with embeddings, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, demonstrating that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist.

<div> Keywords: Traveling Salesman Problem, pre-trained vision language models, combinatorial optimization, heuristic solver, logistics systems

Summary: 
ViTSP introduces a novel framework that utilizes pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to aid in solving large-scale Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs). The VLMs identify small-scale subproblems within a visualized TSP instance, which are then optimized using an off-the-shelf solver to improve the overall solution quality. By leveraging pre-trained models, ViTSP eliminates the need for user-end model training and showcases effectiveness across diverse instances. Experimental results on real-world TSP instances of varying sizes demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with minimal optimality gaps, outperforming existing learning-based methods and the heuristic solver LKH-3. ViTSP particularly excels on very large-scale instances with over 10k nodes, reducing optimality gaps significantly. This framework presents a new approach in combining generative models and operations research solvers for solving combinatorial optimization problems, showing promise for integration into complex logistics systems.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling, and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration. While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for integration into more complex logistics systems.

<div> geo-bias evaluation, AI models, spatial factors, information-theoretic framework, GeoBS 

Summary: 
The article introduces a new information-theoretic framework called GeoBS for evaluating geographic bias in AI models. It addresses the lack of a universal and spatially explicit method to measure geo-bias, incorporating factors like multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy. The framework allows for fair comparison of geo-bias across different models and helps in understanding the spatial factors contributing to bias. The study demonstrates through experiments on various tasks, datasets, and models that both task-specific GeoAI models and general-purpose foundation models can exhibit different types of geo-bias. By establishing this framework, the article aims to advance the technical understanding of geographic bias and promote the integration of spatial fairness into the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.23482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI models, especially foundation models (FMs), has made a profound impact on numerous domains. However, it also raises significant ethical concerns, including bias issues. Although numerous efforts have been made to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in short, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique challenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these measures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or spatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions). We lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit geo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the geo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors contribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an information-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias Scores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by showing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this framework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take intricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy) into consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8 datasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and general-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias. This framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic bias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems.

<div> Keywords: social inequality, personal tutoring, AI tutors, adaptive learning, Item Response Theory

Summary:

One of the main factors contributing to social inequality is the unequal access to personal tutoring, with wealthier individuals having the means to afford it while others do not. To address this issue, the development of affordable and effective AI tutors provides a scalable solution. A focus on adaptive learning, particularly predicting student responses accurately, is crucial for the success of tutoring systems. A new dataset of professional mathematics exam responses has been released, allowing for the development of a probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory. This framework achieves high prediction accuracy, surpassing 80%. Surprisingly, the study reveals that a single latent ability parameter is sufficient to achieve maximum predictive accuracy. Additionally, a novel discrete variational inference framework has been derived and implemented, showing superior performance in low-data settings compared to traditional methods. <div>

Abstract: One of the largest drivers of social inequality is unequal access to personal tutoring, with wealthier individuals able to afford it, while the majority cannot. Affordable, effective AI tutors offer a scalable solution. We focus on adaptive learning, predicting whether a student will answer a question correctly, a key component of any effective tutoring system. Yet many platforms struggle to achieve high prediction accuracy, especially in data-sparse settings. To address this, we release the largest open dataset of professionally marked formal mathematics exam responses to date. We introduce a probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT) that achieves over 80 percent accuracy, setting a new benchmark for mathematics prediction accuracy of formal exam papers. Extending this, our collaborative filtering models incorporate topic-level skill profiles, but reveal a surprising and educationally significant finding, a single latent ability parameter alone is needed to achieve the maximum predictive accuracy. Our main contribution though is deriving and implementing a novel discrete variational inference framework, achieving our highest prediction accuracy in low-data settings and outperforming all classical IRT and matrix factorisation baselines.

<div> Keywords: large language models, benchmark signatures, performance overlaps, benchmark validity, LLM capabilities 

Summary: 
Benchmark signatures are developed to characterize large language model (LLM) benchmarks and their overlaps. These signatures probe the capacity required for benchmark performance by selecting salient tokens from naturally authored corpora. LLM token perplexity, reflecting pre-training exposure, is predictive of benchmark performance. Through a meta-evaluation across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks, signatures are extracted using linear regression analysis. The study reveals high performance overlaps across benchmarks, with varying semantic similarities. Signatures capture variation, overlap, and divergence, identifying overlaps in knowledge and reasoning tasks but less similarity in multilingual and cultural benchmarks. Benchmark signatures remain robust to factors such as question format, highlighting limitations in LLM generalization and benchmark agreement studies. Cross-functional overlaps are observed across logic, math, language, instruction following, and world modeling domains, with coding being the least overlapping domain. This study provides insights into benchmark validity, LLM sensitivities, and interconnected LLM capabilities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora, where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure, becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap. Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following, and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain. Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected LLM capabilities.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new method for measuring trust calibration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Excessive trust in AI can lead to overlooking critical flaws, while insufficient trust may hinder performance. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent metrics for trust calibration. The proposed method utilizes Contextual Bandits to dynamically assess when to trust AI contributions based on contextual information. Evaluation across diverse datasets shows significant improvements in decision-making performance, with reward metrics increasing by 10 to 38%. The findings enhance theoretical understanding and offer practical guidance for developing trustworthy AI systems in critical domains like disease diagnoses and criminal justice.

Abstract: Trust calibration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial for optimal decision-making in collaborative settings. Excessive trust can lead users to accept AI-generated outputs without question, overlooking critical flaws, while insufficient trust may result in disregarding valuable insights from AI systems, hindering performance. Despite its importance, there is currently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration between humans and AI. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent metrics that can be broadly applied across various contexts, and they don't distinguish between the formation of opinions and subsequent human decisions. In this work, we propose a novel and objective method for dynamic trust calibration, introducing a standardized trust calibration measure and an indicator. By utilizing Contextual Bandits-an adaptive algorithm that incorporates context into decision-making-our indicator dynamically assesses when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information. We evaluate this indicator across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in decision-making performance, as evidenced by 10 to 38% increase in reward metrics. These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems supporting decisions in critical domains, for example, disease diagnoses and criminal justice.

Summary: <br />
The article discusses the need for independent evaluation methods for new large language models (LLMs) being released. Currently, evaluating these models involves comparing them in contests, which is expensive and requires human input. The study introduces a simple proxy for Elo scores, a measure of model performance, based on the consistency with which an LLM selects a model as the best in a matchup. This metric is found to be 91% correlated with human-produced Elo scores. By using this proxy, evaluations can be done cheaply and efficiently without the need for human data or prior knowledge. This method provides a convenient way to assess the performance of LLMs quickly and accurately. <br /> <div>

Abstract: New large language models (LLMs) are being released every day. Some perform significantly better or worse than expected given their parameter count. Therefore, there is a need for a method to independently evaluate models. The current best way to evaluate a model is to measure its Elo score by comparing it to other models in a series of contests - an expensive operation since humans are ideally required to compare LLM outputs. We observe that when an LLM is asked to judge such contests, the consistency with which it selects a model as the best in a matchup produces a metric that is 91% correlated with its own human-produced Elo score. This provides a simple proxy for Elo scores that can be computed cheaply, without any human data or prior knowledge.

The study examines multi-turn multi-agent orchestration involving interactions between large language model agents in reaching consensus. Using four LLMs, two experiments were conducted to evaluate orchestration against single-LLM baselines and ablations on different tasks. Orchestration performed at least as well as the strongest single model and outperformed others consistently. Analysis suggests potential for further performance improvements. Ablations showed that revealing authorship led to increased self-voting and ties, while showing ongoing votes amplified herding, speeding convergence but sometimes causing premature consensus. <div>

Abstract: We study multi-turn multi-agent orchestration, where multiple large language model (LLM) agents interact over multiple turns by iteratively proposing answers or casting votes until reaching consensus. Using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR, we conduct two experiments: (i) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM baselines; and (ii) ablations on GPQA-Diamond that vary whether agents see who authored answers and whether they can observe ongoing votes. Orchestration matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet they also introduce novel security challenges. For instance, prompt jailbreaking attacks involve adversaries crafting sophisticated prompts to elicit responses from LLMs that deviate from human values. To uncover vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods, we propose the PASS framework (\underline{P}rompt J\underline{a}ilbreaking via \underline{S}emantic and \underline{S}tructural Formalization). Specifically, PASS employs reinforcement learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions, which enhances stealthiness and enables bypassing existing alignment defenses. The jailbreak outputs are then structured into a GraphRAG system that, by leveraging extracted relevant terms and formalized symbols as contextual input alongside the original query, strengthens subsequent attacks and facilitates more effective jailbreaks. We conducted extensive experiments on common open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.

Summary:<br />
The article proposes a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation model for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) prescriptions. It addresses limitations in previous studies by incorporating patient-personalized information, addressing long-tailed herb distribution and considering herb compatibility. The model, TCM-HEDPR, utilizes pre-training with patient-specific prompt sequences and contrastive learning for data augmentation. It employs a knowledge graph-guided graph diffusion method and a self-attention mechanism to capture symptom-herb relationships globally. Additionally, a heterogeneous graph hierarchical network integrates herbal dispensing relationships with implicit syndromes for fine-grained prescription generation. Experimental results on public and clinical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR, offering a new approach to TCM recommendation incorporating insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.23560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i) Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI, and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm for the recommendation of modern TCM.

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent, which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research: https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/PrefCleanBench.

Summary:
BridgeDrive introduces a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning in autonomous driving. The approach addresses the challenge of effectively guiding diffusion-based planners in reactive environments by translating expert driving behaviors into fine-grained trajectory plans. Unlike previous methods, BridgeDrive maintains a principled diffusion framework that responds adaptively to changing traffic conditions. The planner is compatible with efficient ODE solvers, essential for real-time deployment in autonomous driving scenarios. Through experimentation on the Bench2Drive benchmark, BridgeDrive demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 5% improvement in success rate compared to prior approaches. Overall, BridgeDrive offers a promising solution for enhancing the performance and reliability of autonomous driving systems through anchor-guided diffusion methods. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

<div> Keywords: LLM-based agents, guardrails, personalized, dynamic system, risk accumulation 

Summary: 
PSG-Agent is a new system designed to address the limitations of existing guardrails for LLM-based agents. It introduces personalized guardrails that consider individual user behavior and risk tolerance, as well as dynamic monitoring that tracks risk accumulation across multiple interactions. The system creates user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies based on interaction history and real-time queries. Specialized guards such as Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard, and Memory Guardian continuously monitor the agent pipeline to issue verifiable verdicts. PSG-Agent outperforms existing guardrails like LlamaGuard3 and AGrail in various scenarios, including healthcare, finance, and daily life automation, offering a personalized and audit-friendly approach to ensuring safety for LLM-based agents. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective guardrails are essential for safely deploying LLM-based agents in critical applications. Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all users, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being safe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks evolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we propose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents. First, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries, generating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second, PSG-Agent implements continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline with specialized guards, including Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard, Memory Guardian, that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable verdicts. Finally, we validate PSG-Agent in multiple scenarios including healthcare, finance, and daily life automation scenarios with diverse user profiles. It significantly outperform existing agent guardrails including LlamaGuard3 and AGrail, providing an executable and auditable path toward personalized safety for LLM-based agents.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, reasoning distillation, algorithmic structure, reasoning scaffolding, logical consistency

Summary:
Reasoning distillation techniques using textual rationales have limitations as they teach Small Language Models to mimic surface-level patterns instead of understanding the underlying algorithmic structure of thought. A new framework called Reasoning Scaffolding is introduced to transfer the algorithmic structure directly, reframing reasoning as a structured generation process. This method abstracts the teacher's thought process into interpretable semantic signals and trains the student model to predict these signals and generate corresponding steps, improving logical robustness. The multi-task objective used as a regularizer helps internalize computational patterns of coherent reasoning. Reasoning Scaffolding outperforms existing distillation methods in accuracy and logical consistency on challenging reasoning benchmarks, showing potential for creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners rather than fluent mimics.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The prevailing approach to distilling reasoning from Large Language Models (LLMs)-behavioral cloning from textual rationales-is fundamentally limited. It teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition) that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency, providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners, not just fluent mimics.

<div> semantic complex network, Reinforcement Learning, self-organization, catastrophic forgetting, reasoning process <br />
<br />
Summary:
The study explores the behavior of training large language models using Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). It identifies distinctive patterns such as a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped response-length trajectories, and vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. The authors propose a theory that links these phenomena to the self-organization of a semantic complex network with sparse topology and an average degree near two. This topology drives the model into a frustrated state where slow-learning and forgetting occur before entering a growth phase where new skills are rapidly acquired. The proposed Annealed-RLVR algorithm incorporates a heating step to enhance reasoning capabilities by resolving competitive bottlenecks. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model show that this approach outperforms standard RLVR on various benchmarks. By providing a physical intuition for AI system engineering, this work offers insights into optimizing reasoning capabilities through structural self-organization. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands'' form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory, we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

Abstract: With the rise of multiplayer online games, real-time voice communication is essential for team coordination. However, general ASR systems struggle with gaming-specific challenges like short phrases, rapid speech, jargon, and noise, leading to frequent errors. To address this, we propose the GO-AEC framework, which integrates large language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a data augmentation strategy using LLMs and TTS. GO-AEC includes data augmentation, N-best hypothesis-based correction, and a dynamic game knowledge base. Experiments show GO-AEC reduces character error rate by 6.22% and sentence error rate by 29.71%, significantly improving ASR accuracy in gaming scenarios.

<title>From Reasoning to Answer: Empirical, Attention-Based and Mechanistic Insights into Distilled DeepSeek R1 Models</title>

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains. Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers, confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at \href{https://aka.ms/R2A-code}{this URL}.

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work, we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds, covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover, our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices, such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases are publicly available: https://github.com/jianshuod/SafeSearch.

<title>Measuring Sparse Autoencoder Feature Sensitivity</title>

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features have become essential tools for mechanistic interpretability research. SAE features are typically characterized by examining their activating examples, which are often "monosemantic" and align with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal feature sensitivity: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate feature sensitivity. Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language descriptions for features; instead we use language models to generate text with the same semantic properties as a feature's activating examples. We then test whether the feature activates on these generated texts. We demonstrate that sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants. Our work establishes feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features and SAE architectures.

<title>MedLA: A Logic-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Complex Medical Reasoning with Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA} scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm for trustworthy medical reasoning.

<title>EAPO: Enhancing Policy Optimization with On-Demand Expert Assistance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced in reasoning when optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) under verifiable rewards. Existing methods primarily rely on outcome-based supervision to strengthen internal LLM reasoning, often leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. To mitigate this issue, we propose Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), a novel RL framework that enhances exploration by incorporating multi-turn interactions with external experts during training. Unlike prior methods, where policies reason in isolation, EAPO incentivizes the policy to adaptively determine when and how to consult experts, yielding richer reward signals and more reliable reasoning trajectories. External assistance ultimately internalizes expert knowledge into the policy model, amplifying the model's inherent reasoning capabilities. During evaluation, the policy model has been well-optimized to solve questions independently, producing improved reasoning paths and more accurate solutions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025, show that EAPO consistently outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and RL baselines, with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models.

<title>Diagnosing Failure Root Causes in Platform-Orchestrated Agentic Systems: Dataset, Taxonomy, and Benchmark</title>

arXiv:2509.23735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic systems consisting of multiple LLM-driven agents coordinating through tools and structured interactions, are increasingly deployed for complex reasoning and problem-solving tasks. At the same time, emerging low-code and template-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly build and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as platform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile and it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure root cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these platform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct a dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each with fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We additionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure the reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a taxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution across different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a benchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in which we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show that the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its utility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at most 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light of these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such agentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure root cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy and benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of more reliable agentic systems.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for long-sequence Graphical User Interface tasks are hindered by sparse rewards and the intractable credit assignment problem. To address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model that provides dense, step-by-step feedback to guide agents. GUI-Shepherd is trained on a diverse large-scale data set of $52$k interactions that features human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales, enabling it to serve both as a reward provider for RL training and as a verifier for inference. As far as we know, we are the first to conduct a systematic study of process supervision in GUI agents, across diverse settings from online long-horizon tasks to offline single-step prediction. On the online AndroidWorld benchmark, GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by $7.7$ points via multi-turn online PPO, significantly outperforming Outcome Reward Model based competitors. When used as an inference verifier, it brings $5.1$ points improvements. The benefits generalize to the offline AndroidControl benchmark, with gains of $2.2$ points as a reward provider and $4.3$ points as a verifier. Collectively, our results establish that high-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more capable GUI agents and present a generalizable solution.

Abstract: A central challenge in explainable AI, particularly in the visual domain, is producing explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts. To tackle this, we introduce OCEAN (Object-Centric Explananda via Agent Negotiation), a novel, inherently interpretable framework built on object-centric representations and a transparent multi-agent reasoning process. The game-theoretic reasoning process drives agents to agree on coherent and discriminative evidence, resulting in a faithful and interpretable decision-making process. We train OCEAN end-to-end and benchmark it against standard visual classifiers and popular posthoc explanation tools like GradCAM and LIME across two diagnostic multi-object datasets. Our results demonstrate competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art black-box models with a faithful reasoning process, which was reflected by our user study, where participants consistently rated OCEAN's explanations as more intuitive and trustworthy.

<title>From What to Why: A Multi-Agent System for Evidence-based Chemical Reaction Condition Reasoning</title>

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions, limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable, human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI in scientific discovery.

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the harmfulness of content generated by large language models (LLMs) have been well studied. However, approaches tailored to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain underdeveloped and lack depth. This work highlights the crucial role of visual information in moderating content in visual question answering (VQA), a dimension often overlooked in current research. To bridge this gap, we introduce Falcon, a large-scale vision-language safety dataset containing 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm categories. The dataset provides explicit annotations for harmful attributes across images, instructions, and responses, thereby facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of the content generated by MLLMs. In addition, it includes the relevant harm categories along with explanations supporting the corresponding judgments. We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and safety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other baselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two widely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs.

Abstract: This paper explores adaptive problem solving with a game designed to support the development of problem-solving skills. Using an adaptive, AI-powered puzzle game, our adaptive problem-solving system dynamically generates pathfinding-based puzzles using a genetic algorithm, tailoring the difficulty of each puzzle to individual players in an online real-time approach. A player-modeling system records user interactions and informs the generation of puzzles to approximate a target difficulty level based on various metrics of the player. By combining procedural content generation with online adaptive difficulty adjustment, the system aims to maintain engagement, mitigate frustration, and maintain an optimal level of challenge. A pilot user study investigates the effectiveness of this approach, comparing different types of adaptive difficulty systems and interpreting players' responses. This work lays the foundation for further research into emotionally informed player models, advanced AI techniques for adaptivity, and broader applications beyond gaming in educational settings.

Abstract: E-commerce agents contribute greatly to helping users complete their e-commerce needs. To promote further research and application of e-commerce agents, benchmarking frameworks are introduced for evaluating LLM agents in the e-commerce domain. Despite the progress, current benchmarks lack evaluating agents' capability to handle mixed-type e-commerce dialogue and complex domain rules. To address the issue, this work first introduces a novel corpus, termed Mix-ECom, which is constructed based on real-world customer-service dialogues with post-processing to remove user privacy and add CoT process. Specifically, Mix-ECom contains 4,799 samples with multiply dialogue types in each e-commerce dialogue, covering four dialogue types (QA, recommendation, task-oriented dialogue, and chit-chat), three e-commerce task types (pre-sales, logistics, after-sales), and 82 e-commerce rules. Furthermore, this work build baselines on Mix-Ecom and propose a dynamic framework to further improve the performance. Results show that current e-commerce agents lack sufficient capabilities to handle e-commerce dialogues, due to the hallucination cased by complex domain rules. The dataset will be publicly available.

arXiv:2509.23864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution to autonomous, agentic AI systems introduces significant risks due to their inherent unpredictability and emergent behaviors; this also renders traditional verification methods inadequate and necessitates a shift towards probabilistic guarantees where the question is no longer if a system will fail, but the probability of its failure within given constraints. This paper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI systems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm called Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection layer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events corresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to dynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally models the agent's emergent behavior. Using probabilistic model checking, the framework then verifies quantitative properties in real-time.

Abstract: Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited, therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows its effectiveness.

Abstract: OpenAI's GPT-OSS family provides open-weight language models with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and a Harmony prompt format. We summarize an extensive security evaluation of GPT-OSS-20B that probes the model's behavior under different adversarial conditions. Us- ing the Jailbreak Oracle (JO) [1], a systematic LLM evaluation tool, the study uncovers several failure modes including quant fever, reasoning blackholes, Schrodinger's compliance, reasoning procedure mirage, and chain-oriented prompting. Experiments demonstrate how these behaviors can be exploited on GPT-OSS-20B models, leading to severe consequences.

<title>From Neural Networks to Logical Theories: The Correspondence between Fibring Modal Logics and Fibring Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the (pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models \emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders. Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks with the tools of computational logic.

<title>Conditional Advantage Estimation for Reinforcement Learning in Large Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length, have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

<title>Automatic selection of primary studies in systematic reviews with evolutionary rule-based classification</title>

Abstract: Searching, filtering and analysing scientific literature are time-consuming tasks when performing a systematic literature review. With the rise of artificial intelligence, some steps in the review process are progressively being automated. In particular, machine learning for automatic paper selection can greatly reduce the effort required to identify relevant literature in scientific databases. We propose an evolutionary machine learning approach, called \ourmodel, to automatically determine whether a paper retrieved from a literature search process is relevant. \ourmodel builds an interpretable rule-based classifier using grammar-guided genetic programming. The use of a grammar to define the syntax and the structure of the rules allows \ourmodel to easily combine the usual textual information with other bibliometric data not considered by state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments demonstrate that it is possible to generate accurate classifiers without impairing interpretability and using configurable information sources not supported so far.

Abstract: Scientific discovery is often slowed by the manual development of computational tools needed to analyze complex experimental data. Building such tools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review literature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data, and implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature, reasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering new opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing LLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing computational methods or on developing computational methods or models for general machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured knowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an agentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation function and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the application. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree representation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model diagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We conducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI agents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and satellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in genetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology, including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their target genes. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Alistair-Turcan/TusoAI.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) and agent techniques for data analysis (a.k.a LLM/Agent-as-Data-Analyst) have demonstrated substantial impact in both academica and industry. In comparison with traditional rule or small-model based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline orchestration. The technical evolution further distills five key design goals for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design, modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows, and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data (e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling), (iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding, programming languages vulnerable detection), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g., data retrieval and modality alignment for data lakes). Finally, we outline the remaining challenges and propose several insights and practical directions for advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis.

Abstract: Learning to learn is becoming a science, driven by the convergence of knowledge tracing, signal processing, and generative AI to model student learning states and optimize education. We propose CoTutor, an AI-driven model that enhances Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with signal processing techniques to improve student progress modeling and deliver adaptive feedback and strategies. Deployed as an AI copilot, CoTutor combines generative AI with adaptive learning technology. In university trials, it has demonstrated measurable improvements in learning outcomes while outperforming conventional educational tools. Our results highlight its potential for AI-driven personalization, scalability, and future opportunities for advancing privacy and ethical considerations in educational technology. Inspired by Richard Hamming's vision of computer-aided 'learning to learn,' CoTutor applies convex optimization and signal processing to automate and scale up learning analytics, while reserving pedagogical judgment for humans, ensuring AI facilitates the process of knowledge tracing while enabling learners to uncover new insights.

<title>Do Repetitions Matter? Strengthening Reliability in LLM Evaluations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression, domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world reliability.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning has emerged as a key focus for enabling agentic applications. Among these, DeepResearch Agents have gained significant attention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended information-seeking tasks. We introduce Fathom-DeepResearch, an agentic system composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and (iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES, WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25, GPQA-Diamond, and MedQA.

<title>Transparent, Evaluable, and Accessible Data Agents: A Proof-of-Concept Framework</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a modular, component-based architecture for developing and evaluating AI agents that bridge the gap between natural language interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses. The system directly addresses core challenges in data accessibility by enabling non-technical users to interact with complex data warehouses through a conversational interface, translating ambiguous user intent into precise, executable database queries to overcome semantic gaps. A cornerstone of the design is its commitment to transparent decision-making, achieved through a multi-layered reasoning framework that explains the "why" behind every decision, allowing for full interpretability by tracing conclusions through specific, activated business rules and data points. The architecture integrates a robust quality assurance mechanism via an automated evaluation framework that serves multiple functions: it enables performance benchmarking by objectively measuring agent performance against golden standards, and it ensures system reliability by automating the detection of performance regressions during updates. The agent's analytical depth is enhanced by a statistical context module, which quantifies deviations from normative behavior, ensuring all conclusions are supported by quantitative evidence including concrete data, percentages, and statistical comparisons. We demonstrate the efficacy of this integrated agent-development-with-evaluation framework through a case study on an insurance claims processing system. The agent, built on a modular architecture, leverages the BigQuery ecosystem to perform secure data retrieval, apply domain-specific business rules, and generate human-auditable justifications. The results confirm that this approach creates a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for deploying LLM-powered agents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains.

<title>Reasoning or Retrieval? A Study of Answer Attribution on Large Reasoning Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors: problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

<title>Robust Preference Optimization: Aligning Language Models with Noisy Preference Feedback</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of each label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point in the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their corresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic transformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts, elevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a perfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a meta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3 models, the RPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% and 5.4%, respectively.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online alignment (e.g., GRPO) is generally more performant than offline alignment (e.g., DPO) -- but why? Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral economics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online on-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what the model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to just stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive probability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our theory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental to maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by selectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception, rather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would allow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing performance. To this end, we propose a design pattern that explicitly incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like DPO/KTO/GRPO, creating humanline variants of them. Surprisingly, we find that these humanline variants, even when trained with offline off-policy data, can match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and unverifiable tasks.

arXiv:2509.24230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable intelligent multi-robot collaboration but face fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs that scale poorly with team size and task complexity. In this paper, we propose ELHPlan, a novel framework that introduces Action Chains--sequences of actions explicitly bound to sub-goal intentions--as the fundamental planning primitive. ELHPlan operates via a cyclical process: 1) constructing intention-bound action sequences, 2) proactively validating for conflicts and feasibility, 3) refining issues through targeted mechanisms, and 4) executing validated actions. This design balances adaptability and efficiency by providing sufficient planning horizons while avoiding expensive full re-planning. We further propose comprehensive efficiency metrics, including token consumption and planning time, to more holistically evaluate multi-agent collaboration. Our experiments on benchmark TDW-MAT and C-WAH demonstrate that ELHPlan achieves comparable task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by state-of-the-art methods. Our research establishes a new efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems.

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning, yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph, backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth, achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem difficulty.

<title>Model Merging Scaling Laws in Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study empirical scaling laws for language model merging measured by cross-entropy. Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward AGI-level systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models (LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy. However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements, reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

Abstract: Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90 percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041 test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.

arXiv:2509.24261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However, existing methods suffer from an exploration dilemma: the sharply peaked initial policies of pre-trained LLMs confine standard RL algorithms to a narrow set of solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but suppressing solution diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). As a result, RLVR often distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm, Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement, requiring only minor code modifications. On six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However, traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline, representing a 12.2\% relative improvement in click-through rates. This agentic architecture enables parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous learning, making it particularly suitable for large-scale healthcare communication optimization.

<title>AdvChain: Adversarial Chain-of-Thought Tuning for Robust Safety Alignment of Large Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

<title>G-reasoner: Foundation Models for Unified Reasoning over Graph-structured Knowledge</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG (GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency and cross-graph generalization.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations: (a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b) heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training, SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together, SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated promising performance on medical benchmarks and in preliminary trials as clinical assistants. Yet, our pilot audit of diagnostic cases uncovers a critical failure mode: instability in early evidence interpretation precedes hallucination, creating branching reasoning trajectories that cascade into globally inconsistent conclusions. This highlights the need for clinical reasoning agents that constrain stochasticity and hallucination while producing auditable decision flows. We introduce MedMMV, a controllable multimodal multi-agent framework for reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning. MedMMV stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate steps in a structured evidence graph under the supervision of a Hallucination Detector, and aggregates candidate paths with a Combined Uncertainty scorer. On six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and, more critically, demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations confirm that MedMMV substantially increases reasoning truthfulness without sacrificing informational content. By controlling instability through a verifiable, multi-agent process, our framework provides a robust path toward deploying trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes domains like clinical decision support.

Abstract: There is a strong recent emphasis on trustworthy AI. In particular, international regulations, such as the AI Act, demand that AI practitioners measure data quality on the input and estimate bias on the output of high-risk AI systems. However, there are many challenges involved, including scalability (MMD) and computability (Wasserstein-1) issues of traditional methods for estimating distances on measure spaces. Here, we present humancompatible.detect, a toolkit for bias detection that addresses these challenges. It incorporates two newly developed methods to detect and evaluate bias: maximum subgroup discrepancy (MSD) and subsampled $\ell_\infty$ distances. It has an easy-to-use API documented with multiple examples. humancompatible.detect is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

Abstract: The exponential technological breakthrough of the FinTech industry has significantly enhanced user engagement through sophisticated advisory chatbots. However, large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs can occasionally yield unprofessional or flippant remarks, such as ``With that money, you're going to change the world,'' which, though factually correct, can be contextually inappropriate and erode user trust. The scarcity of domain-specific datasets has led previous studies to focus on isolated components, such as reasoning-aware frameworks or the enhancement of human-like response generation. To address this research gap, we present Fin-Solution 2.O, an advanced solution that 1) introduces the multi-turn financial conversational dataset, Fin-Vault, and 2) incorporates a unified model, Fin-Ally, which integrates commonsense reasoning, politeness, and human-like conversational dynamics. Fin-Ally is powered by COMET-BART-embedded commonsense context and optimized with a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) mechanism to generate human-aligned responses. The novel Fin-Vault dataset, consisting of 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues, enables Fin-Ally to extend beyond basic account management to provide personalized budgeting, real-time expense tracking, and automated financial planning. Our comprehensive results demonstrate that incorporating commonsense context enables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and professionally grounded financial guidance, positioning this approach as a next-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector.

<title>From Static to Dynamic: Adaptive Monte Carlo Search for Mathematical Process Supervision</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of process data plays a key role in training a Process Reward Model (PRM), which can enhance the complex mathematical reasoning capability of large language models. Existing methods estimate the quality of reasoning steps based on a fixed-budget sampling strategy and navigate a vast search space to perform path expansion during the automated data generation process, resulting in their inefficiency and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation from fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value estimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer samples for those that are easier to estimate. On the other hand, it enhances the path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with a temporally adaptive policy that begins with broad exploration and gradually shifts toward exploiting the most promising directions. With AMCS, we construct a large-scale dataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training PRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500 with GLM-4-9B, outperforming all baseline PRMs. Notably, a 7B model supervised by Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision. Moreover, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS maintains consistent advantages on out-of-distribution problems, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Our code is available at https://github.com/reml-group/AMCS.

<title>Plan before Solving: Problem-Aware Strategy Routing for Mathematical Reasoning with LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24377</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods usually leverage a fixed strategy, such as natural language reasoning, code-augmented reasoning, tool-integrated reasoning, or ensemble-based reasoning, to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform mathematical reasoning. Our analysis reveals that the single strategy cannot adapt to problem-specific requirements and thus overlooks the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Planning and Routing through Instance-Specific Modeling (PRISM), a novel framework that decouples mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and targeted execution. Specifically, we first curate a multi-strategy preference dataset, which we call MathStrat, capturing correctness, process quality, and computational efficiency for each problem--strategy pair. Then, we train a lightweight Strategy Adapter based on the dataset to obtain confidence distributions over the mentioned four reasoning strategies. At inference time, an adaptive routing policy dynamically tailors the reasoning approach based on predictor confidence. It directs the model to use single-strategy execution for high-confidence predictions, dual-strategy verification for competitive scenarios, or comprehensive multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases. Extensive experiments across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble baselines, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different base models. The adaptive routing approach shows particularly strong benefits for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures. Our code is released at https://github.com/reml-group/PRISM.

<title>Towards Safe Reasoning in Large Reasoning Models via Corrective Intervention</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution. However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a practical path to safer LRMs.

Abstract: With the increasing complexity of industrial systems, there is a pressing need for predictive maintenance to avoid costly downtime and disastrous outcomes that could be life-threatening in certain domains. With the growing popularity of the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and real-time big data analytics, there is a unique opportunity for efficient predictive maintenance to forecast equipment failures for real-time intervention and optimize maintenance actions, as traditional reactive and preventive maintenance practices are often inadequate to meet the requirements for the industry to provide quality-of-services of operations. Central to this evolution is digital twin technology, an adaptive virtual replica that continuously monitors and integrates sensor data to simulate and improve asset performance. Despite remarkable progress in digital twin implementations, such as considering DT in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering. This paper aims to address this void. We perform a retrospective analysis of the temporal evolution of the digital twin in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering to capture the applications, middleware, and technological requirements that led to the development of the digital twin from its inception to the AI-enabled digital twin and its self-learning models. We provide a layered architecture of the digital twin technology, as well as a taxonomy of the technology-enabled industrial engineering applications systems, middleware, and the used Artificial Intelligence algorithms. We provide insights into these systems for the realization of a trustworthy and efficient smart digital-twin industrial engineering ecosystem. We discuss future research directions in digital twin for predictive maintenance in industrial engineering.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging test-time scaling (TTS). However, while most PRMs exhibit substantial gains in mathematical domains, the scarcity of domain-specific training data and knowledge-based learning patterns limits their generalization ability when faced with other domains. To address this limitation, we shift the learning objective from verifying domain-specific knowledge to modeling domain-agnostic logical flow. Centering on contextual coherence between chain-of-thought (CoT) steps, our approach is realized through a novel data annotation and training framework, which enhances the model's generalization capabilities across diverse domains. For instance, our resulting model, ContextPRM, achieves a notable 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the majority voting baseline via weighted majority voting across nine non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, including law, history, and philosophy, significantly surpassing the 2.2% improvement from VersaPRM and 0.5% gains from other mathematics-focused PRMs, demonstrating consistent performance across both mathematical and non-mathematical domains.

arXiv:2509.24489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual modeling in Constraint Programming is a substantial bottleneck, which Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to automate. However, passive CA methods are prone to over-fitting, often learning models that include spurious global constraints when trained on limited data, while purely active methods can be query-intensive. We introduce a hybrid CA framework specifically designed to address the challenge of over-fitting in CA. Our approach integrates passive learning for initial candidate generation, a query-driven interactive refinement phase that utilizes probabilistic confidence scores (initialized by machine learning priors) to systematically identify over-fitted constraints, and a specialized subset exploration mechanism to recover valid substructures from rejected candidates. A final active learning phase ensures model completeness. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model coverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with manageable query complexity. This framework represents a substantial advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to Dynamic Artificial Neural Networks (D-ANNs) for multi-task demand forecasting called Neuroplastic Multi-Task Network (NMT-Net). Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic network adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and selective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods. NMT-Net offers a scalable, adaptable solution for multi-task and continual learning in time series prediction. The complete code for NMT-Net is available from our GitHub repository.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models (LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics (EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

Abstract: World models learn general knowledge from videos and simulate experience for training behaviors in imagination, offering a path towards intelligent agents. However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast and accurate world model. In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent agents.

Abstract: This paper presents BPMN Assistant, a tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural language-based creation and editing of BPMN diagrams. A specialized JSON-based representation is introduced as a structured alternative to the direct handling of XML to enhance the accuracy of process modifications. Process generation quality is evaluated using Graph Edit Distance (GED) and Relative Graph Edit Distance (RGED), while editing performance is evaluated with a binary success metric. Results show that JSON and XML achieve similar similarity scores in generation, but JSON offers greater reliability, faster processing, and significantly higher editing success rates. We discuss key trade-offs, limitations, and future improvements. The implementation is available at https://github.com/jtlicardo/bpmn-assistant.

We implement a new CPU tool called Bolt improving over the state of the art by learning formulas more than 100x faster over 70% of the benchmarks, with smaller or equal formulas in 98% of the cases. Our key insight is to leverage a problem called Boolean Set Cover as a subroutine to combine existing formulas using Boolean connectives. Thanks to the Boolean Set Cover component, our approach offers a novel trade-off between efficiency and formula size.

Abstract: Humans quickly learn new concepts from a small number of examples. Replicating this capacity with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has proven to be challenging. When it comes to learning subjective tasks-where there is an evident scarcity of data-this capacity needs to be recreated. In this work, we propose an intuitive human-agent teaching architecture in which the human can teach an agent how to perform a task by providing demonstrations, i.e., examples. To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be able to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our objective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge. Then, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a limited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most representative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply our proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where the agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on human examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our experiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100 examples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples. We show that by providing examples in strategic order along with a learning method that leverages external symbolic knowledge, the agent can generalize more efficiently.

<title>Successful Misunderstandings: Learning to Coordinate Without Being Understood</title>

Abstract: The main approach to evaluating communication is by assessing how well it facilitates coordination. If two or more individuals can coordinate through communication, it is generally assumed that they understand one another. We investigate this assumption in a signaling game where individuals develop a new vocabulary of signals to coordinate successfully. In our game, the individuals do not have common observations besides the communication signal and outcome of the interaction, i.e. received reward. This setting is used as a proxy to study communication emergence in populations of agents that perceive their environment very differently, e.g. hybrid populations that include humans and artificial agents. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations while not observing how other agents are using them. While populations always converge to optimal levels of coordination, in some cases, interacting agents interpret and use signals differently, converging to what we call successful misunderstandings. However, agents of population that coordinate using misaligned interpretations, are unable to establish successful coordination with new interaction partners. Not leading to coordination failure immediately, successful misunderstandings are difficult to spot and repair. Having at least three agents that all interact with each other are the two minimum conditions to ensure the emergence of shared interpretations. Under these conditions, the agent population exhibits this emergent property of compensating for the lack of shared observations of signal use, ensuring the emergence of shared interpretations.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

Abstract: Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a formidable challenge due to their high-dimensional, noisy, and non-Euclidean nature. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG) framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics. To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more generalizable and robust neural representations.

<title>From Ambiguity to Verdict: A Semiotic-Grounded Multi-Perspective Agent for LLM Logical Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models (LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL), while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94) and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05% average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite (TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1 delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

Abstract: Explaining why a language model produces a particular output requires local, input-level explanations. Existing methods uncover global capability circuits (e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a specific input query in a particular way. We introduce query circuits, which directly trace the information flow inside a model that maps a specific input to the output. Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders), query circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more faithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits practical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation Faithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit recovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable to circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based methods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully describe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and ARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model that can recover much of its performance on single queries. For example, a circuit covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of performance on an MMLU questions. Overall, query circuits provide a step towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process individual inputs.

<title>Pushing LLMs to Their Logical Reasoning Bound: The Role of Data Reasoning Intensity</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However, most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential.

Abstract: Physics is central to understanding and shaping the real world, and the ability to solve physics problems is a key indicator of real-world physical intelligence. Physics Olympiads, renowned as the crown of competitive physics, provide a rigorous testbed requiring complex reasoning and deep multimodal understanding, yet they remain largely underexplored in AI research. Existing approaches are predominantly single-model based, and open-source MLLMs rarely reach gold-medal-level performance. To address this gap, we propose PhysicsMinions, a coevolutionary multi-agent system for Physics Olympiad. Its architecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret diagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform dual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement loop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic Studio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground truth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads, PhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization: it consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different sizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii) Historic breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold medals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score metric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source Pass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406 contestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked 22nd). Generally, PhysicsMinions offers a generalizable framework for Olympiad-level problem solving, with the potential to extend across disciplines.

Abstract: The social science of large language models (LLMs) examines how these systems evoke mind attributions, interact with one another, and transform human activity and institutions. We conducted a systematic review of 270 studies, combining text embeddings, unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to build a computational taxonomy. Three domains emerge organically across the reviewed literature. LLM as Social Minds examines whether and when models display behaviors that elicit attributions of cognition, morality and bias, while addressing challenges such as test leakage and surface cues. LLM Societies examines multi-agent settings where interaction protocols, architectures and mechanism design shape coordination, norms, institutions and collective epistemic processes. LLM-Human Interactions examines how LLMs reshape tasks, learning, trust, work and governance, and how risks arise at the human-AI interface. This taxonomy provides a reproducible map of a fragmented field, clarifies evidentiary standards across levels of analysis, and highlights opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial intelligence.

<title>RealUnify: Do Unified Models Truly Benefit from Unification? A Comprehensive Benchmark</title>

Abstract: The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI. However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy. RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10 categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1) Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense, logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding, which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the potential of unified modeling.

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire (PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have significant implications for psychometrics and social science research, providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

Abstract: Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for biological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between competing theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve data-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and often impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework designed to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative theories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional data-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure. This work provides a more general, scalable, and automated approach for integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in neuroscience and beyond.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

Abstract: With the tremendous advancement of deep learning and communication technology, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception has the potential to address limitations in sensing distant objects and occlusion for a single-agent perception system. V2X cooperative perception systems are software systems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying fusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions. Therefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational challenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous predictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by conducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically evaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception performance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in cooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of the critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and identify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation configuration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2) Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication exhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher frequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not robust against communication interference when running online. Our results reveal potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of cooperative perception systems. We hope that our findings can better promote the design and repair of cooperative perception systems.

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

Abstract: Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered, while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1 improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more efficiently training more capable reasoning models.

Abstract: Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive agents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and robotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information, which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover possible interactions and current state information to synthesize environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks across 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use agents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration synthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and verifier. This data enables training MLLM-based UI agents that improve success rates up to $20.0\%$ on mobile-use and $10.9\%$ on computer-use scenarios. In addition, AutoPlay generated tasks combined with MLLM verifier-based rewards enable scaling reinforcement learning training of UI agents, leading to an additional $5.7\%$ gain. coverage. These results establish AutoPlay as a scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents reducing reliance on human annotation.

<title>Cogito, Ergo Ludo: An Agent that Learns to Play by Reasoning and Planning</title>

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito, ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e., Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world through explicit reasoning on raw experience.

Abstract: Heatwaves pose complex cascading risks across interconnected climate, social, and economic systems, but knowledge fragmentation in scientific literature hinders comprehensive understanding of these risk pathways. We introduce HeDA (Heatwave Discovery Agent), an intelligent multi-agent system designed for automated scientific discovery through knowledge graph construction and multi-layer risk propagation analysis. HeDA processes over 10,247 academic papers to construct a comprehensive knowledge graph with 23,156 nodes and 89,472 relationships, employing novel multi-layer risk propagation analysis to systematically identify overlooked risk transmission pathways. Our system achieves 78.9% accuracy on complex question-answering tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines including GPT-4 by 13.7%. Critically, HeDA successfully discovered five previously unidentified high-impact risk chains, such as the pathway where a heatwave leads to a water demand surge, resulting in industrial water restrictions and ultimately causing small business disruption, which were validated through historical case studies and domain expert review. This work presents a new paradigm for AI-driven scientific discovery, providing actionable insights for developing more resilient climate adaptation strategies.

<title>From $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to $f(g(x))$: LLMs Learn New Skills in RL by Composing Old Ones</title>

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies. This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation. Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target, requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills, then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex problems.

<title>The Era of Real-World Human Interaction: RL from User Conversations</title>

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users' natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable, effective supervision for personalized alignment.

<title>Vision-and-Language Navigation with Analogical Textual Descriptions in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions. We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in navigation performance.

<title>ReasoningBank: Scaling Agent Self-Evolving with Reasoning Memory</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.25140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back, enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling (MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task, the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks, ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

<title>Visual serial processing deficits explain divergences in human and VLM reasoning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.25142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do Vision Language Models (VLMs), despite success on standard benchmarks, often fail to match human performance on surprisingly simple visual reasoning tasks? While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we hypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial processing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance across tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation. Tasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors such as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and transformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a consistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with increased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As tasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts, enumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human performance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis, indicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.

<title>UniAPL: A Unified Adversarial Preference Learning Framework for Instruct-Following</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25148</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.25148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment. We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g., Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich, ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient, ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's. UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration, inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507 as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the teacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm that UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based judgments leverage powerful LLMs to efficiently evaluate candidate content and provide judgment scores. However, the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the interaction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce \textit{J-Detector}, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{J-Detector} and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges. Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in discrete audio codecs have significantly improved speech representation modeling, while codec language models have enabled in-context learning for zero-shot speech synthesis. Inspired by this, we propose a voice conversion (VC) model within the VALLE-X framework, leveraging its strong in-context learning capabilities for speaker adaptation. To enhance prosody control, we introduce a prosody-aware audio codec encoder (PACE) module, which isolates and refines prosody from other sources, improving expressiveness and control. By integrating PACE into our VC model, we achieve greater flexibility in prosody manipulation while preserving speaker timbre. Experimental evaluation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline VC systems in prosody preservation, timbre consistency, and overall naturalness, surpassing baseline VC systems.

Abstract: The automatic configuration of Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) optimizers has become increasingly critical as the large number of configurations can significantly affect solver performance. Yet the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks has led to data leakage and over-optimistic claims, as prior studies often rely on homogeneous datasets and inconsistent experimental setups. To promote a fair evaluation process, we present BenLOC, a comprehensive benchmark and open-source toolkit, which not only offers an end-to-end pipeline for learning instance-wise MIP optimizer configurations, but also standardizes dataset selection, train-test splits, feature engineering and baseline choice for unbiased and comprehensive evaluations. Leveraging this framework, we conduct an empirical analysis on five well-established MIP datasets and compare classical machine learning models with handcrafted features against state-of-the-art deep-learning techniques. The results demonstrate the importance of datasets, features and baseline criteria proposed by BenLOC and the effectiveness of BenLOC in providing unbiased and comprehensive evaluations.

Abstract: This letter proposes a YOLO-based framework for spatial bearing fault diagnosis using time-frequency spectrograms derived from continuous wavelet transform (CWT). One-dimensional vibration signals are first transformed into time-frequency spectrograms using Morlet wavelets to capture transient fault signatures. These spectrograms are then processed by YOLOv9, v10, and v11 models to classify fault types. Evaluated on three benchmark datasets, including Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Paderborn University (PU), and Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS), the proposed CWT-YOLO pipeline achieves significantly higher accuracy and generalizability than the baseline MCNN-LSTM model. Notably, YOLOv11 reaches mAP scores of 99.4% (CWRU), 97.8% (PU), and 99.5% (IMS). In addition, its region-aware detection mechanism enables direct visualization of fault locations in spectrograms, offering a practical solution for condition monitoring in rotating machinery.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an agentic double deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduler for licensed/unlicensed band allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) networks. Beyond conventional reward-seeking reinforcement learning (RL), the agent perceives and reasons over a multi-dimensional context that jointly captures queueing delay, link quality, coexistence intensity, and switching stability. A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under constrained bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5% versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL networks. The proposed scheduler is an embodied agent (E-agent) tailored for task-specific, resource-efficient operation at the network edge.

Abstract: In this paper, a green learning (GL)-based precoding framework is proposed for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO broadcasting systems. Motivated by the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability in future 6G networks, this work adopts a broadcasting transmission architecture for scenarios where multiple users share identical information, improving spectral efficiency and reducing redundant transmissions and power consumption. Different from conventional optimization methods, such as block coordinate descent (BCD) that require perfect channel state information (CSI) and iterative computation, the proposed GL framework operates directly on received uplink pilot signals without explicit CSI estimation. Unlike deep learning (DL) approaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach also avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more lightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with supervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully CSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with adjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature selection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to jointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation results show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral efficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point operations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the proposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and hardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios.

arXiv:2509.10740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to formalize some of the ways scientific concepts are formed in the process of theoretical physics discovery. Since this may at first seem like a task beyond the scope of the exact sciences (natural and formal sciences), we begin by presenting arguments for why scientific concept formation can be formalized. Then, we introduce type theory as a natural and well-suited framework for this formalization. We formalize what we call "ways of discovering new concepts" including concept distinction, property preservation, and concept change, as cognitive typing rules. Next, we apply these cognitive typing rules to two case studies of conceptual discovery in the history of physics: Einstein's reasoning leading to the impossibility of frozen waves, and his conceptual path to the relativity of time. In these historical episodes, we recast what a physicist might informally call "ways of discovering new scientific concepts" as compositional typing rules built from cognitive typing rules - thus formalizing them as scientific discovery mechanisms. Lastly, we computationally model the type-theoretic reconstruction of Einstein's conceptual path to the relativity of time as a program synthesis task.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sustainable long short-term memory (LSTM)-based precoding framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Instead of explicit channel state information (CSI) estimation, the framework exploits uplink pilot sequences to implicitly learn channel characteristics, reducing both pilot overhead and inference complexity. Practical hardware constraints are addressed by incorporating the phase-dependent amplitude model of RIS elements, while a multi-label training strategy improves robustness when multiple near-optimal codewords yield comparable performance. Simulations show that the proposed design achieves over 90% of the spectral efficiency of exhaustive search (ES) with only 2.2% of its computation time, cutting energy consumption by nearly two orders of magnitude. The method also demonstrates resilience under distribution mismatch and scalability to larger RIS arrays, making it a practical and energy-efficient solution for sustainable 6G wireless networks.

Abstract: In recent years, the guitar has received increased attention from the music information retrieval (MIR) community driven by the challenges posed by its diverse playing techniques and sonic characteristics. Mainly fueled by deep learning approaches, progress has been limited by the scarcity and limited annotations of datasets. To address this, we present the Guitar On Audio and Tablatures (GOAT) dataset, comprising 5.9 hours of unique high-quality direct input audio recordings of electric guitars from a variety of different guitars and players. We also present an effective data augmentation strategy using guitar amplifiers which delivers near-unlimited tonal variety, of which we provide a starting 29.5 hours of audio. Each recording is annotated using guitar tablatures, a guitar-specific symbolic format supporting string and fret numbers, as well as numerous playing techniques. For this we utilise both the Guitar Pro format, a software for tablature playback and editing, and a text-like token encoding. Furthermore, we present competitive results using GOAT for MIDI transcription and preliminary results for a novel approach to automatic guitar tablature transcription. We hope that GOAT opens up the possibilities to train novel models on a wide variety of guitar-related MIR tasks, from synthesis to transcription to playing technique detection.

Abstract: Classical search engines using indexing methods in data infrastructures primarily allow keyword-based queries to retrieve content. While these indexing-based methods are highly scalable and efficient, due to a lack of an appropriate evaluation dataset and a limited understanding of semantics, they often fail to capture the user's intent and generate incomplete responses during evaluation. This problem also extends to domain-specific search systems that utilize a Knowledge Base (KB) to access data from various research infrastructures. Research infrastructures (RIs) from the environmental and earth science domain, which encompass the study of ecosystems, biodiversity, oceanography, and climate change, generate, share, and reuse large volumes of data. While there are attempts to provide a centralized search service using Elasticsearch as a knowledge base, they also face similar challenges in understanding queries with multiple intents. To address these challenges, we proposed an automated method to curate a domain-specific evaluation dataset to analyze the capability of a search system. Furthermore, we incorporate the Retrieval of Augmented Generation (RAG), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for high-quality retrieval of environmental domain data using natural language queries. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis of the evaluation dataset shows that LLM-based systems for information retrieval return results with higher precision when understanding queries with multiple intents, compared to Elasticsearch-based systems.

Abstract: Ensuring fair outcomes for multiple stakeholders in recommender systems has been studied mostly in terms of algorithmic interventions: building new models with better fairness properties, or using reranking to improve outcomes from an existing algorithm. What has rarely been studied is structural changes in the recommendation ecosystem itself. Our work explores the fairness impact of algorithmic pluralism, the idea that the recommendation algorithm is decoupled from the platform through which users access content, enabling user choice in algorithms. Prior work using a simulation approach has shown that niche consumers and (especially) niche providers benefit from algorithmic choice. In this paper, we use simulation to explore the question of profile portability, to understand how different policies regarding the handling of user profiles interact with fairness outcomes for consumers and providers.

Abstract: The next Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is mainly based on sequential traffic information to predict the user's next boarding point location. This is a highly regarded and widely applied research task in the field of intelligent transportation, and there have been many research results to date. Traditional POI prediction models primarily rely on short-term traffic sequence information, often neglecting both long-term and short-term preference data, as well as crucial spatiotemporal context features in user behavior. To address this issue, this paper introduces user long-term preference information and key spatiotemporal context information, and proposes a POI recommendation model based on multimodal spatiotemporal context feature embedding. The model extracts long-term preference features and key spatiotemporal context features from traffic data through modules such as spatiotemporal feature processing, multimodal embedding, and self-attention aggregation. It then uses a weighted fusion method to dynamically adjust the weights of long-term and short-term features based on users' historical behavior patterns and the current context. Finally, the fused features are matched using attention, and the probability of each location candidate becoming the next location is calculated. This paper conducts experimental verification on multiple transportation datasets, and the results show that the POI prediction model combining multiple types of features has higher prediction accuracy than existing SOTA models and methods.

<title>PISA: An AI Pipeline for Interpretable-by-design Survival Analysis Providing Multiple Complexity-Accuracy Trade-off Models</title>

Abstract: Survival analysis is central to clinical research, informing patient prognoses, guiding treatment decisions, and optimising resource allocation. Accurate time-to-event predictions not only improve quality of life but also reveal risk factors that shape clinical practice. For these models to be relevant in healthcare, interpretability is critical: predictions must be traceable to patient-specific characteristics, and risk factors should be identifiable to generate actionable insights for both clinicians and researchers. Traditional survival models often fail to capture non-linear interactions, while modern deep learning approaches, though powerful, are limited by poor interpretability.
  We propose a Pipeline for Interpretable Survival Analysis (PISA) - a pipeline that provides multiple survival analysis models that trade off complexity and performance. Using multiple-feature, multi-objective feature engineering, PISA transforms patient characteristics and time-to-event data into multiple survival analysis models, providing valuable insights into the survival prediction task. Crucially, every model is converted into simple patient stratification flowcharts supported by Kaplan-Meier curves, whilst not compromising on performance. While PISA is model-agnostic, we illustrate its flexibility through applications of Cox regression and shallow survival trees, the latter avoiding proportional hazards assumptions.
  Applied to two clinical benchmark datasets, PISA produced interpretable survival models and intuitive stratification flowcharts whilst achieving state-of-the-art performances. Revisiting a prior departmental study further demonstrated its capacity to automate survival analysis workflows in real-world clinical research.

<title>Learning Hyperspectral Images with Curated Text Prompts for Efficient Multimodal Alignment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22697</link>

Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI), the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives, along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07 percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa ($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters, nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

Abstract: Intelligent agents often require collaborative strategies to achieve complex tasks beyond individual capabilities in real-world scenarios. While existing audio-visual navigation (AVN) research mainly focuses on single-agent systems, their limitations emerge in dynamic 3D environments where rapid multi-agent coordination is critical, especially for time-sensitive applications like emergency response. This paper introduces MASTAVN (Multi-Agent Scalable Transformer Audio-Visual Navigation), a scalable framework enabling two agents to collaboratively localize and navigate toward an audio target in shared 3D environments. By integrating cross-agent communication protocols and joint audio-visual fusion mechanisms, MASTAVN enhances spatial reasoning and temporal synchronization. Through rigorous evaluation in photorealistic 3D simulators (Replica and Matterport3D), MASTAVN achieves significant reductions in task completion time and notable improvements in navigation success rates compared to single-agent and non-collaborative baselines. This highlights the essential role of spatiotemporal coordination in multi-agent systems. Our findings validate MASTAVN's effectiveness in time-sensitive emergency scenarios and establish a paradigm for advancing scalable multi-agent embodied intelligence in complex 3D environments.

Abstract: This study presents a machine learning-assisted approach to optimize task scheduling in cluster systems, focusing on node-affinity constraints. Traditional schedulers like Kubernetes struggle with real-time adaptability, whereas the proposed continuous transfer learning model evolves dynamically during operations, minimizing retraining needs. Evaluated on Google Cluster Data, the model achieves over 99% accuracy, reducing computational overhead and improving scheduling latency for constrained tasks. This scalable solution enables real-time optimization, advancing machine learning integration in cluster management and paving the way for future adaptive scheduling strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains but often exhibit disparities in how they handle real-life queries. To systematically investigate these effects within various disability contexts, we introduce \textbf{AccessEval (Accessibility Evaluation)}, a benchmark evaluating 21 closed- and open-source LLMs across 6 real-world domains and 9 disability types using paired Neutral and Disability-Aware Queries. We evaluated model outputs with metrics for sentiment, social perception, and factual accuracy.
  Our analysis reveals that responses to disability-aware queries tend to have a more negative tone, increased stereotyping, and higher factual error compared to neutral queries. These effects show notable variation by domain and disability type, with disabilities affecting hearing, speech, and mobility disproportionately impacted. These disparities reflect persistent forms of ableism embedded in model behavior.
  By examining model performance in real-world decision-making contexts, we better illuminate how such biases can translate into tangible harms for disabled users. This framing helps bridges the gap between technical evaluation and user impact, reinforcing importance of bias mitigation in day-to-day applications.

Abstract: Cloud computing is an established technology allowing users to share resources on a large scale, never before seen in IT history. A cloud system connects multiple individual servers in order to process related tasks in several environments at the same time. Clouds are typically more cost-effective than single computers of comparable computing performance. The sheer physical size of the system itself means that thousands of machines may be involved. The focus of this research was to design a strategy to dynamically allocate tasks without overloading Cloud nodes which would result in system stability being maintained at minimum cost. This research has added the following new contributions to the state of knowledge: (i) a novel taxonomy and categorisation of three classes of schedulers, namely OS-level, Cluster and Big Data, which highlight their unique evolution and underline their different objectives; (ii) an abstract model of cloud resources utilisation is specified, including multiple types of resources and consideration of task migration costs; (iii) a virtual machine live migration was experimented with in order to create a formula which estimates the network traffic generated by this process; (iv) a high-fidelity Cloud workload simulator, based on a month-long workload traces from Google's computing cells, was created; (v) two possible approaches to resource management were proposed and examined in the practical part of the manuscript: the centralised metaheuristic load balancer and the decentralised agent-based system. The project involved extensive experiments run on the University of Westminster HPC cluster, and the promising results are presented together with detailed discussions and a conclusion.

Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts (GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset (CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance performance on both seen and unseen classes.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&amp;W, to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative methods, such as PGD and C&amp;W, are more robust to localization constraints than single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and designing robust defensive systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integral as productivity assistants, but existing benchmarks fall short in rigorously evaluating their real-world instruction-following capabilities. Current benchmarks often (i) lack sufficient multilinguality, (ii) fail to capture the implicit constraints inherent in user requests, and (iii) overlook the complexities of multi-turn dialogue. To address these critical gaps and provide a more realistic assessment, we introduce TRUEBench (Trustworthy Real-world Usage Evaluation Benchmark)1, a novel benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based productivity assistants. TRUEBench distinguishes itself by featuring input prompts across 12 languages, incorporating intra-instance multilingual instructions, employing rigorous evaluation criteria to capture both explicit and implicit constraints, and including complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios with both accumulating constraints and context switches. Furthermore, to ensure reliability in evaluation, we refined constraints using an LLM validator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TRUEBench presents significantly greater challenges than existing benchmarks; for instance, a strong model like OpenAI o1 achieved only a 69.07% overall pass rate. TRUEBench offers a demanding and realistic assessment of LLMs in practical productivity settings, highlighting their capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation. These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT), are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the explainability Transformers.

<title>LayoutAgent: A Vision-Language Agent Guided Compositional Diffusion for Spatial Layout Planning</title>

Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images, but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning, leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency, but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation. Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation, object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

Abstract: Digital transformation (DT) has become a strategic priority for public administrations, particularly due to the need to deliver more efficient and citizen-centered services and respond to societal expectations, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). In this context, the main objective of this study is to propose an innovative methodology to automatically evaluate the level of digital transformation (DT) in public sector organizations. The proposed approach combines traditional assessment methods with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The methodology follows a dual approach: on the one hand, surveys are conducted using specialized staff from various public entities; on the other, AI-based models (including neural networks and transformer architectures) are used to estimate the DT level of the organizations automatically. Our approach has been applied to a real-world case study involving local public administrations in the Valencian Community (Spain) and shown effective performance in assessing DT. While the proposed methodology has been validated in a specific local context, its modular structure and dual-source data foundation support its international scalability, acknowledging that administrative, regulatory, and DT maturity factors may condition its broader applicability. The experiments carried out in this work include (i) the creation of a domain-specific corpus derived from the surveys and websites of several organizations, used to train the proposed models; (ii) the use and comparison of diverse AI methods; and (iii) the validation of our approach using real data. The integration of technologies such as the IoT, sensor networks, and AI-based analytics can significantly support resilient, agile urban environments and the transition towards more effective and sustainable Smart City models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly positioned as solutions for education, yet evaluations often reduce their impact to narrow performance metrics. This paper reframes the question by asking "what kind of impact should LLMs have in education?" Drawing on Biesta's tripartite account of good education: qualification, socialisation, and subjectification, we present a meta-analysis of 133 experimental and quasi-experimental studies (k = 188). Overall, the impact of LLMs on student learning is positive but uneven. Strong effects emerge in qualification, particularly when LLMs function as tutors in sustained interventions. Socialisation outcomes appear more variable, concentrated in sustained, reflective interventions. Subjectification, linked to autonomy and learner development, remains fragile, with improvements confined to small-scale, long-term studies. This purpose-level view highlights design as the decisive factor: without scaffolds for participation and agency, LLMs privilege what is easiest to measure while neglecting broader aims of education. For HCI and education, the issue is not just whether LLMs work, but what futures they enable or foreclose.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in image and audio generation, largely due to Classifier-Free Guidance. However, the choice of guidance scale remains underexplored: a fixed scale often fails to generalize across prompts of varying complexity, leading to oversaturation or weak alignment. We address this gap by introducing a prompt-aware framework that predicts scale-dependent quality and selects the optimal guidance at inference. Specifically, we construct a large synthetic dataset by generating samples under multiple scales and scoring them with reliable evaluation metrics. A lightweight predictor, conditioned on semantic embeddings and linguistic complexity, estimates multi-metric quality curves and determines the best scale via a utility function with regularization. Experiments on MSCOCO~2014 and AudioCaps show consistent improvements over vanilla CFG, enhancing fidelity, alignment, and perceptual preference. This work demonstrates that prompt-aware scale selection provides an effective, training-free enhancement for pretrained diffusion backbones.

Abstract: Traditional sentiment analysis has long been a unimodal task, relying solely on text. This approach overlooks non-verbal cues such as vocal tone and prosody that are essential for capturing true emotional intent. We introduce Dynamic Attention Fusion (DAF), a lightweight framework that combines frozen text embeddings from a pretrained language model with acoustic features from a speech encoder, using an adaptive attention mechanism to weight each modality per utterance. Without any finetuning of the underlying encoders, our proposed DAF model consistently outperforms both static fusion and unimodal baselines on a large multimodal benchmark. We report notable gains in F1-score and reductions in prediction error and perform a variety of ablation studies that support our hypothesis that the dynamic weighting strategy is crucial for modeling emotionally complex inputs. By effectively integrating verbal and non-verbal information, our approach offers a more robust foundation for sentiment prediction and carries broader impact for affective computing applications -- from emotion recognition and mental health assessment to more natural human computer interaction.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised significant safety concerns, particularly regarding "jailbreak" attacks that exploit adversarial prompts to bypass safety alignment mechanisms. Existing defense research primarily focuses on single-turn attacks, whereas multi-turn jailbreak attacks progressively break through safeguards through by concealing malicious intent and tactical manipulation, ultimately rendering conventional single-turn defenses ineffective. To address this critical challenge, we propose the Bidirectional Intention Inference Defense (BIID). The method integrates forward request-based intention inference with backward response-based intention retrospection, establishing a bidirectional synergy mechanism to detect risks concealed within seemingly benign inputs, thereby constructing a more robust guardrails that effectively prevents harmful content generation. The proposed method undergoes systematic evaluation compared with a no-defense baseline and seven representative defense methods across three LLMs and two safety benchmarks under 10 different attack methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) across both single-turn and multi-turn jailbreak attempts, outperforming all existing baseline methods while effectively maintaining practical utility. Notably, comparative experiments across three multi-turn safety datasets further validate the proposed model's significant advantages over other defense approaches.

Abstract: A full power flow (PF) model is a complete representation of the physical power network. Traditional model-based methods rely on the full PF model to implement power flow analysis. In practice, however, some PF model parameters can be inaccurate or even unavailable due to the uncertainties or dynamics in the power systems. Moreover, because the power network keeps evolving with possibly changing topology, the generalizability of a PF model to different network sizes and typologies should be considered. In this paper, we propose a PF rebuild model based on graph attention networks (GAT) by constructing a new graph based on the real and imaginary parts of voltage at each bus. By comparing with two state-of-the-art PF rebuild models for different standard IEEE power system cases and their modified topology variants, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves better accuracy for a changing network and can generalize to different networks with less accuracy discount.

Abstract: This paper explores the development and adoption of AI-based formative feedback in the context of biweekly reports in an engineering Capstone program. Each student is required to write a short report detailing their individual accomplishments over the past two weeks, which is then assessed by their advising professor. An LLM-powered tool was developed to provide students with personalized feedback on their draft reports, guiding them toward improved completeness and quality. Usage data across two rounds revealed an initial barrier to adoption, with low engagement rates. However, students who engaged in the AI feedback system demonstrated the ability to use it effectively, leading to improvements in the completeness and quality of their reports. Furthermore, the tool's task-parsing capabilities provided a novel approach to identify potential student organizational tasks and deliverables. The findings suggest initial skepticism toward the tool with a limited adoption within the studied context, however, they also highlight the potential for AI-driven tools to provide students and professors valuable insights and formative support.

Abstract: As increasingly capable large language model (LLM)-based agents are developed, the potential harms caused by misalignment and loss of control grow correspondingly severe. To address these risks, we propose an approach that directly measures and controls the agency of these AI systems. We conceptualize the agency of LLM-based agents as a property independent of intelligence-related measures and consistent with the interdisciplinary literature on the concept of agency. We offer (1) agency as a system property operationalized along the dimensions of preference rigidity, independent operation, and goal persistence, (2) a representation engineering approach to the measurement and control of the agency of an LLM-based agent, and (3) regulatory tools enabled by this approach: mandated testing protocols, domain-specific agency limits, insurance frameworks that price risk based on agency, and agency ceilings to prevent societal-scale risks. We view our approach as a step toward reducing the risks that motivate the ``Scientist AI'' paradigm, while still capturing some of the benefits from limited agentic behavior.

<title>Consistency Models as Plug-and-Play Priors for Inverse Problems</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have found extensive use in solving numerous inverse problems. Such diffusion inverse problem solvers aim to sample from the posterior distribution of data given the measurements, using a combination of the unconditional score function and an approximation of the posterior related to the forward process. Recently, consistency models (CMs) have been proposed to directly predict the final output from any point on the diffusion ODE trajectory, enabling high-quality sampling in just a few NFEs. CMs have also been utilized for inverse problems, but existing CM-based solvers either require additional task-specific training or utilize data fidelity operations with slow convergence, not amenable to large-scale problems. In this work, we reinterpret CMs as proximal operators of a prior, enabling their integration into plug-and-play (PnP) frameworks. We propose a solver based on PnP-ADMM, which enables us to leverage the fast convergence of conjugate gradient method. We further accelerate this with noise injection and momentum, dubbed PnP-CM, and show it maintains the convergence properties of the baseline PnP-ADMM. We evaluate our approach on a variety of inverse problems, including inpainting, super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CM trained for MRI datasets. Our results show that PnP-CM achieves high-quality reconstructions in as few as 4 NFEs, and can produce meaningful results in 2 steps, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world inverse problems while outperforming comparable CM-based approaches.

Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity (600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation, CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal reasoning.

<title>Painless Activation Steering: An Automated, Lightweight Approach for Post-Training Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are typically post-trained for desired capabilities and behaviors via weight-based or prompt-based steering, but the former is time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is not precisely controllable and often requires manual trial-and-error. While activation steering (AS) promises a cheap, fast, and controllable alternative to the two existing post-training methods, current AS techniques require hand-crafted prompt pairs or labor-intensive feature annotation, making them more inconvenient than the plug-and-play methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce Painless Activation Steering (PAS), a family of fully automated methods that make AS readily usable with any given labeled dataset, with no need for prompt construction, feature labeling, or human intervention. We evaluate PAS on three open-weight models (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-8B, and Nous-Hermes-2) and 18 tasks; we find that PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks, but not for intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the strongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8% on Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context Learning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results provide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy it as a practical, automated LM post-training option.

Abstract: Audiovisual instance segmentation (AVIS) requires accurately localizing and tracking sounding objects throughout video sequences. Existing methods suffer from visual bias stemming from two fundamental issues: uniform additive fusion prevents queries from specializing to different sound sources, while visual-only training objectives allow queries to converge to arbitrary salient objects. We propose Audio-Centric Query Generation using cross-attention, enabling each query to selectively attend to distinct sound sources and carry sound-specific priors into visual decoding. Additionally, we introduce Sound-Aware Ordinal Counting (SAOC) loss that explicitly supervises sounding object numbers through ordinal regression with monotonic consistency constraints, preventing visual-only convergence during training. Experiments on AVISeg benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements: +1.64 mAP, +0.6 HOTA, and +2.06 FSLA, validating that query specialization and explicit counting supervision are crucial for accurate audiovisual instance segmentation.

Abstract: Risk assessments for advanced AI systems require evaluating both the models themselves and their deployment contexts. We introduce the Societal Capacity Assessment Framework (SCAF), an indicators-based approach to measuring a society's vulnerability, coping capacity, and adaptive capacity in response to AI-related risks. SCAF adapts established resilience analysis methodologies to AI, enabling organisations to ground risk management in insights about country-level deployment conditions. It can also support stakeholders in identifying opportunities to strengthen societal preparedness for emerging AI capabilities. By bridging disparate literatures and the "context gap" in AI evaluation, SCAF promotes more holistic risk assessment and governance as advanced AI systems proliferate globally.

Abstract: Driven by large scale datasets and LLM based architectures, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable improvements in accuracy. However, challenges persist for domain-specific terminology, and short utterances lacking semantic coherence, where recognition performance often degrades significantly. In this work, we present Index-MSR, an efficient multimodal speech recognition framework. At its core is a novel Multimodal Fusion Decoder (MFD), which effectively incorporates text-related information from videos (e.g., subtitles and presentation slides) into the speech recognition. This cross-modal integration not only enhances overall ASR accuracy but also yields substantial reductions in substitution errors. Extensive evaluations on both an in-house subtitle dataset and a public AVSR dataset demonstrate that Index-MSR achieves sota accuracy, with substitution errors reduced by 20,50%. These results demonstrate that our approach efficiently exploits text-related cues from video to improve speech recognition accuracy, showing strong potential in applications requiring strict audio text synchronization, such as audio translation.

<title>Defending MoE LLMs against Harmful Fine-Tuning via Safety Routing Alignment</title>

arXiv:2509.22745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have increasingly adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for efficiency. MoE-based LLMs heavily depend on a superficial safety mechanism in which harmful inputs are routed safety-critical experts. However, our analysis reveals that routing decisions for harmful inputs drift significantly after fine-tuning, exposing a critical vulnerability to harmful fine-tuning (HFT) attacks. Existing defenses, primarily designed for monolithic LLMs, are less effective for MoE LLMs as they fail to prevent drift in harmful input routing. To address this limitation, we propose SafeMoE, a safe fine-tuning method tailored to MoE LLMs. SafeMoE directly mitigates routing drift by penalizing the gap between the routing weights of a fine-tuned model and those of the initial safety-aligned model, thereby preserving the safety-aligned routing of harmful inputs to safety-critical experts. Experiments on open-source MoE LLMs ranging from 7B to 141B parameters demonstrate that SafeMoE effectively mitigates HFT attacks, reducing the harmfulness score of OLMoE from 62.0 to 5.0, for example, while maintaining task utility within 1% degradation and incurring only 2% overhead. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods for safeguarding LLM fine-tuning and remains effective in recent large-scale MoE LLMs such as gpt-oss and Llama 4. Our implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SafeMoE.

<title>MIRAGE: Multi-hop Reasoning with Ambiguity Evaluation for Illusory Questions</title>

arXiv:2509.22750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world Multi-hop Question Answering (QA) often involves ambiguity that is inseparable from the reasoning process itself. This ambiguity creates a distinct challenge, where multiple reasoning paths emerge from a single question, each requiring independent resolution. Since each sub-question is ambiguous, the model must resolve ambiguity at every step. Thus, answering a single question requires handling multiple layers of ambiguity throughout the reasoning chain. We find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle in this setting, typically exploring wrong reasoning paths and producing incomplete answers. To facilitate research on multi-hop ambiguity, we introduce MultI-hop Reasoning with AmbiGuity Evaluation for Illusory Questions (MIRAGE), a benchmark designed to analyze and evaluate this challenging intersection of ambiguity interpretation and multi-hop reasoning. MIRAGE contains 1,142 high-quality examples of ambiguous multi-hop questions, categorized under a taxonomy of syntactic, general, and semantic ambiguity, and curated through a rigorous multi-LLM verification pipeline. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models struggle on MIRAGE, confirming that resolving ambiguity combined with multi-step inference is a distinct and significant challenge. To establish a robust baseline, we propose CLarifying Ambiguity with a Reasoning and InstructiON (CLARION), a multi-agent framework that significantly outperforms existing approaches on MIRAGE, paving the way for more adaptive and robust reasoning systems.

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is a central challenge in machine learning when tasks lack ground truth labels or involve ambiguity and noise. Conventional frameworks, rooted in the Cranfield paradigm and label-based metrics, fail in such cases because they cannot assess how robustly a system performs under uncertain interpretations. We introduce VB-Score, a variance-bounded evaluation framework that measures both effectiveness and robustness without requiring ground truth. Given a query or input, VB-Score enumerates plausible interpretations, assigns probabilities, and evaluates output by expected success penalized by variance, rewarding consistent performance across intents. We provide a formal analysis of VB-Score, establishing range, monotonicity, and stability properties, and relate it to risk-sensitive measures such as mean-variance utility. Experiments on ambiguous queries and entity-centric retrieval tasks show that VB-Score surfaces robustness differences hidden by conventional metrics. By enabling reproducible, label-free evaluation, VB-Score offers a principled foundation for benchmarking machine learning systems in ambiguous or label-scarce domains.

Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a highly active research domain that seeks to enable vehicles to perceive dynamic environments, predict the future trajectories of traffic agents such as vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists and plan safe and efficient future motions. To advance the field, several competitive platforms and benchmarks have been established to provide standardized datasets and evaluation protocols. Among these, leaderboards by the CARLA organization and nuPlan and the Waymo Open Dataset have become leading benchmarks for assessing motion planning algorithms. Each offers a unique dataset and challenging planning problems spanning a wide range of driving scenarios and conditions. In this study, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of the motion planning methods featured on these three leaderboards. To ensure a fair and unified evaluation, we adopt CARLA leaderboard v2.0 as our common evaluation platform and modify the selected models for compatibility. By highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches, we identify prevailing trends, common challenges, and suggest potential directions for advancing motion planning research.

Abstract: Safe autonomous driving requires both accurate HD map construction and persistent awareness of traffic rules, even when their associated signs are no longer visible. However, existing methods either focus solely on geometric elements or treat rules as temporary classifications, failing to capture their persistent effectiveness across extended driving sequences. In this paper, we present PAMR (Persistent Autoregressive Mapping with Traffic Rules), a novel framework that performs autoregressive co-construction of lane vectors and traffic rules from visual observations. Our approach introduces two key mechanisms: Map-Rule Co-Construction for processing driving scenes in temporal segments, and Map-Rule Cache for maintaining rule consistency across these segments. To properly evaluate continuous and consistent map generation, we develop MapDRv2, featuring improved lane geometry annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAMR achieves superior performance in joint vector-rule mapping tasks, while maintaining persistent rule effectiveness throughout extended driving sequences.

Abstract: This study presents a structured approach to evaluating vulnerabilities within quantum cryptographic protocols, focusing on the BB84 quantum key distribution method and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) approved quantum-resistant algorithms. By integrating AI-driven red teaming, automated penetration testing, and real-time anomaly detection, the research develops a framework for assessing and mitigating security risks in quantum networks. The findings demonstrate that AI can be effectively used to simulate adversarial attacks, probe weaknesses in cryptographic implementations, and refine security mechanisms through iterative feedback. The use of automated exploit simulations and protocol fuzzing provides a scalable means of identifying latent vulnerabilities, while adversarial machine learning techniques highlight novel attack surfaces within AI-enhanced cryptographic processes. This study offers a comprehensive methodology for strengthening quantum security and provides a foundation for integrating AI-driven cybersecurity practices into the evolving quantum landscape.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance in various domains, including image generation. However, existing reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space. Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE, achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) - UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union (IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks via in-context learning (ICL) without parameter updates, making them powerful learning engines for fast adaptation. While extensive research has examined ICL as a few-shot learner, whether it can achieve long-term retention and cross-task knowledge accumulation when multitasks arrive sequentially remains underexplored. Motivated by human memory studies, we investigate the retention characteristics of ICL in multitask settings and extend it to in-context continual learning (ICCL), where continual learning ability emerges through task scheduling and prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks demonstrate that, for specific large-language models, ICCL benefits from distributed practice (DP) in a manner analogous to humans, consistently revealing a spacing "sweet spot" for retention. Beyond retention performance, we propose a human-retention similarity metric to quantify how closely a continual-learning (CL) method aligns with human retention dynamics. Using this metric, we show that linear-attention models such as MAMBA and RWKV exhibit particularly human-like retention patterns, despite their retention performance lagging behind that of Transformer-based LLMs. Overall, our results establish ICCL as both cognitively plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only CL paradigm that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity dilemma in conventional CL methods.

Abstract: We present a theoretical and empirical analysis of the SyncRank algorithm for recovering a global ranking from noisy pairwise comparisons. By adopting a complex-valued data model where the true ranking is encoded in the phases of a unit-modulus vector, we establish a sharp non-asymptotic recovery guarantee for the associated semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. Our main theorem characterizes a critical noise threshold - scaling as sigma = O(sqrt(n / log n)) - below which SyncRank achieves exact ranking recovery with high probability. Extensive experiments under this model confirm the theoretical predictions and demonstrate the algorithm's robustness across varying problem sizes and noise regimes.

Abstract: We study instrumental variable regression (IVaR) under differential privacy constraints. Classical IVaR methods (like two-stage least squares regression) rely on solving moment equations that directly use sensitive covariates and instruments, creating significant risks of privacy leakage and posing challenges in designing algorithms that are both statistically efficient and differentially private. We propose a noisy two-state gradient descent algorithm that ensures $\rho$-zero-concentrated differential privacy by injecting carefully calibrated noise into the gradient updates. Our analysis establishes finite-sample convergence rates for the proposed method, showing that the algorithm achieves consistency while preserving privacy. In particular, we derive precise bounds quantifying the trade-off among privacy parameters, sample size, and iteration-complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide both privacy guarantees and provable convergence rates for instrumental variable regression in linear models. We further validate our theoretical findings with experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that our method offers practical accuracy-privacy trade-offs.

Abstract: Reliable detection and classification of power system events are critical for maintaining grid stability and situational awareness. Existing approaches often depend on limited labeled datasets, which restricts their ability to generalize to rare or unseen disturbances. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates generative modeling, sliding-window temporal processing, and decision fusion to achieve robust event detection and classification using synchrophasor data. A variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network is employed to model normal operating conditions, where both reconstruction error and discriminator error are extracted as anomaly indicators. Two complementary decision strategies are developed: a threshold-based rule for computational efficiency and a convex hull-based method for robustness under complex error distributions. These features are organized into spatiotemporal detection and classification matrices through a sliding-window mechanism, and an identification and decision fusion stage integrates the outputs across PMUs. This design enables the framework to identify known events while systematically classifying previously unseen disturbances into a new category, addressing a key limitation of supervised classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing machine learning, deep learning, and envelope-based baselines. The ability to recognize unknown events further highlights the adaptability and practical value of the proposed approach for wide-area event analysis in modern power systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality, semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168 human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc), while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for Best-of-N sampling.

Abstract: Recommendation models are predominantly trained using implicit user feedback, since explicit feedback is often costly to obtain. However, implicit feedback, such as clicks, does not always reflect users' real preferences. For example, a user might click on a news article because of its attractive headline, but end up feeling uncomfortable after reading the content. In the absence of explicit feedback, such erroneous implicit signals may severely mislead recommender systems. In this paper, we propose MTRec, a novel sequential recommendation framework designed to align with real user preferences by uncovering their internal satisfaction on recommended items. Specifically, we introduce a mental reward model to quantify user satisfaction and propose a distributional inverse reinforcement learning approach to learn it. The learned mental reward model is then used to guide recommendation models to better align with users' real preferences. Our experiments show that MTRec brings significant improvements to a variety of recommendation models. We also deploy MTRec on an industrial short video platform and observe a 7 percent increase in average user viewing time.

Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs. Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue, handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly personalized multi-modal AI.

<title>Dynamic Buffers: Cost-Efficient Planning for Tabletop Rearrangement with Stacking</title>

Abstract: Rearranging objects in cluttered tabletop environments remains a long-standing challenge in robotics. Classical planners often generate inefficient, high-cost plans by shuffling objects individually and using fixed buffers--temporary spaces such as empty table regions or static stacks--to resolve conflicts. When only free table locations are used as buffers, dense scenes become inefficient, since placing an object can restrict others from reaching their goals and complicate planning. Allowing stacking provides extra buffer capacity, but conventional stacking is static: once an object supports another, the base cannot be moved, which limits efficiency. To overcome these issues, a novel planning primitive called the Dynamic Buffer is introduced. Inspired by human grouping strategies, it enables robots to form temporary, movable stacks that can be transported as a unit. This improves both feasibility and efficiency in dense layouts, and it also reduces travel in large-scale settings where space is abundant. Compared with a state-of-the-art rearrangement planner, the approach reduces manipulator travel cost by 11.89% in dense scenarios with a stationary robot and by 5.69% in large, low-density settings with a mobile manipulator. Practicality is validated through experiments on a Delta parallel robot with a two-finger gripper. These findings establish dynamic buffering as a key primitive for cost-efficient and robust rearrangement planning.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models(LLMs) is one of the most compute-intensive tasks in high-performance computing. Predicting end-to-end training time for multi-billion parameter models distributed across hundreds of GPUs remains challenging due to complex interactions between transformer components, parallelism strategies(data, model, pipeline, tensor), and multi-tier communication. Learned models require costly sampling, while analytical models often struggle with real-world network and hardware complexities. We address this by decomposing LLMs into core computational primitives and modeling them with: (1) operator-level decomposition for fine-grained analysis; (2) lightweight sampling based hardware-aware prediction models for key operations; (3) an end-to-end prediction system integrating these components across complex parallelization strategies. Crucially, our methodology has been validated on two large-scale HPC systems. Our framework achieves low average prediction errors-4.98\% on Perlmutter(A100) and 9.38\% on Vista(GH200)-for models up to 20B parameters across 128 GPUs. Importantly, it runs entirely on CPUs, enabling rapid iteration over hardware configurations and training strategies without costly on-cluster experimentation.

Abstract: Intent-Based Networking (IBN) aims to simplify network management by enabling users to specify high-level goals that drive automated network design and configuration. However, translating informal natural-language intents into formally correct optical network topologies remains challenging due to inherent ambiguity and lack of rigor in Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose a novel hybrid pipeline that integrates LLM-based intent parsing, formal methods, and Optical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). By enriching design decisions with domain-specific optical standards and systematically incorporating symbolic reasoning and verification techniques, our pipeline generates explainable, verifiable, and trustworthy optical network designs. This approach significantly advances IBN by ensuring reliability and correctness, essential for mission-critical networking tasks.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks, yet most existing approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%.
  Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

<title>Multimodal Slice Interaction Network Enhanced by Transfer Learning for Precise Segmentation of Internal Gross Tumor Volume in Lung Cancer PET/CT Imaging</title>

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths globally. Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves a Dice of 0.609 on the private IGTV dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385. This work highlights the potential of transfer learning, coupled with advanced multimodal techniques and a SIM to enhance the reliability and clinical relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models, ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model (LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

<title>Adaptive Margin RLHF via Preference over Preferences</title>

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses, or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy, particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and one favoring generative performance.

Abstract: Proteomics data is essential to pathogenic understanding of a disease phenotype. In cancer, analysis of molecular signatures enables precision medicine through the identification of biological processes that drive individualized tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and clinical heterogeneity. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capacity to integrate and reason across heterogeneous data modalities. However, performing multi-modal language modeling for molecular understanding of patient-specific proteomics remains a significant challenge due to two barriers: (1) the lack of instruction-tuning datasets that enable clinical interpretation from proteomics data, and (2) the absence of language modeling architectures designed to capture the rich heterogeneity of molecular data. In this work, we introduce CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT, the first instruction tuning dataset for molecular understanding of oncology, comprising over 400k open-ended examples derived from individualized proteomic profiles curated from the largest national proteomics cancer study (CPTAC). Additionally, we propose KRONOS (Knowledge Representation of patient Omics Networks in Oncology via Structured tuning), a novel graph-LLM framework that leverages molecular interaction topology with proteomics to learn patient-specific graph representations for enhanced clinical reasoning. We show that KRONOS achieves competitive performance across benchmark clinical tasks, including molecular classification, temporal trajectory modeling, and tumor stage prediction from proteomics data. Ultimately, this approach empowers LLMs to understand patient-level pathogenesis, advancing precision medicine through more accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment stratification.

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption, the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies: CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical results on real-world data.

Abstract: Wi-Fi-based positioning promises a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for location-based services in indoor environments such as malls, airports, and campuses. RSS-based methods are widely deployable as RSS data is available on all Wi-Fi-capable devices, but RSS is highly sensitive to multipath, channel variations, and receiver characteristics. While supervised learning methods offer improved robustness, they require large amounts of labeled data, which is often costly to obtain. We introduce a lightweight framework that solves this by automating high-resolution synchronized RSS-location data collection using a short, camera-assisted calibration phase. An overhead camera is calibrated only once with ArUco markers and then tracks a device collecting RSS data from broadcast packets of nearby access points across Wi-Fi channels. The resulting (x, y, RSS) dataset is used to automatically train mobile-deployable localization algorithms, avoiding the privacy concerns of continuous video monitoring. We quantify the accuracy limits of such vision-assisted RSS data collection under key factors such as tracking precision and label synchronization. Using the collected experimental data, we benchmark traditional and supervised learning approaches under varying signal conditions and device types, demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization, validating the utility of the proposed framework for practical use. All code, tools, and datasets are released as open source.

Abstract: In the context of industrial factories and energy producers, unplanned outages are highly costly and difficult to service. However, existing acoustic-anomaly detection studies largely rely on generic industrial or synthetic datasets, with few focused on hydropower plants due to limited access. This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly detection methods, as a way to improve predictive maintenance in hydropower plants. We address key challenges in the acoustic preprocessing under highly noisy conditions before extracting time- and frequency-domain features. Then, we benchmark three machine learning models: LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, which are tested on two real-world datasets from the Rodundwerk II pumped-storage plant in Austria, one with induced anomalies and one with real-world conditions. The One-Class SVM achieved the best trade-off of accuracy (ROC AUC 0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder delivered strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at the expense of higher computational cost.

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor, typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet (https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

Abstract: This paper presents Extract-0, a 7-billion parameter language model specifically optimized for document information extraction that achieves performance exceeding models with parameter counts several orders of magnitude larger. Through a novel combination of synthetic data generation, supervised fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Extract-0 achieves a mean reward of 0.573 on a benchmark of 1,000 diverse document extraction tasks, outperforming GPT-4.1 (0.457), o3 (0.464), and GPT-4.1-2025 (0.459). The training methodology employs a memory-preserving synthetic data generation pipeline that produces 280,128 training examples from diverse document sources, followed by parameterefficient fine-tuning that modifies only 0.53% of model weights (40.4M out of 7.66B parameters). The reinforcement learning phase introduces a novel semantic similarity-based reward function that handles the inherent ambiguity in information extraction tasks. This research demonstrates that task-specific optimization can yield models that surpass general-purpose systems while requiring substantially fewer computational resource.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for defense and surveillance but remains challenging due to (1) target loss from minimal features, (2) false alarms in cluttered environments, (3) missed detections from low saliency, and (4) high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose TY-RIST, an optimized YOLOv12n architecture that integrates (1) a stride-aware backbone with fine-grained receptive fields, (2) a high-resolution detection head, (3) cascaded coordinate attention blocks, and (4) a branch pruning strategy that reduces computational cost by about 25.5% while marginally improving accuracy and enabling real-time inference. We also incorporate the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to enhance regression stability. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and across 20 different models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, improving mAP at 0.5 IoU by +7.9%, Precision by +3%, and Recall by +10.2%, while achieving up to 123 FPS on a single GPU. Cross-dataset validation on a fifth dataset further confirms strong generalization capability. Additional results and resources are available at https://www.github.com/moured/TY-RIST

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to large language model (LLM) distillation by formulating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem. While recent work has begun exploring the integration of task-specific rewards into distillation processes, existing methods typically rely on ad-hoc reward weighting. We propose a principled optimization framework that maximizes task-specific rewards while constraining the divergence from the teacher model to remain below a specified threshold. Our approach adapts constrained state augmented reinforcement learning to the distillation setting, introducing a modified reward function that maintains theoretical guarantees of constraint satisfaction without requiring state augmentation or teacher model access during deployment and without the computational overhead of the dual Lagrangian methods. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that our method achieves better constraint satisfaction rates and better reasoning compared to the soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines while maintaining competitive task performance. Our framework provides a theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for reward-aware distillation in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training, reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution. Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen), Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement, along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) can be useful in diagnosing medical conditions, but few studies have evaluated their consistency in recommending appropriate medication regimens. The purpose of this evaluation was to test GPT-4o on three medication benchmarking tests including mapping a drug name to its correct formulation, identifying drug-drug interactions using both its internal knowledge and using a web search, and preparing a medication order sentence after being given the medication name. Methods: Using GTP-4o three experiments were completed. Accuracy was quantified by computing cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L F1 between each response and its reference string or by manual evaluation by clinicians. Results: GPT-4o performed poorly on drug-formulation matching, with frequent omissions of available drug formulations (mean 1.23 per medication) and hallucinations of formulations that do not exist (mean 1.14 per medication). Only 49% of tested medications were correctly matched to all available formulations. Accuracy was decreased for medications with more formulations (p<0.0001). GPT-4o was also inconsistent at identifying drug-drug-interactions, although it had better performance with the search-augmented assessment compared to its internal knowledge (54.7% vs. 69.2%, p=0.013). However, allowing a web-search worsened performance when there was no drug-drug interaction (median % correct 100% vs. 40%, p<0.001). Finally, GPT-4o performed moderately with preparing a medication order sentence, with only 65.8% of medication order sentences containing no medication or abbreviation errors. Conclusions: Model performance was overall poor for all tests. This highlights the need for domain-specific training through clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for benchmarking performance.

Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on $\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a leading technique for improving the accuracy of quantized neural networks. Previous work has shown that decomposing training into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields superior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of compute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from 86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final performance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of compute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide range of model sizes and quantization widths using the tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss scaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance across different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We use the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify experimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory constraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to full-precision model accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel cooldown and QAT fusion approach that performs learning rate decay jointly with quantization-aware training, eliminating redundant full-precision model updates and achieving significant compute savings. These findings provide practical insights into efficient QAT planning and enable the training of higher-quality quantized models with the same compute budget.

Abstract: The majority of deep learning-based speech enhancement methods require paired clean-noisy speech data. Collecting such data at scale in real-world conditions is infeasible, which has led the community to rely on synthetically generated noisy speech. However, this introduces a gap between the training and testing phases. In this work, we propose a novel dual-branch encoder-decoder architecture for unsupervised speech enhancement that separates the input into clean speech and residual noise. Adversarial training is employed to impose priors on each branch, defined by unpaired datasets of clean speech and, optionally, noise. Experimental results show that our method achieves performance comparable to leading unsupervised speech enhancement approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate the critical impact of clean speech data selection on enhancement performance. In particular, our findings reveal that performance may appear overly optimistic when in-domain clean speech data are used for prior definition -- a practice adopted in previous unsupervised speech enhancement studies.

<title>What Matters More For In-Context Learning under Matched Compute Budgets: Pretraining on Natural Text or Incorporating Targeted Synthetic Examples?</title>

Abstract: Does explicitly exercising the induction circuit during pretraining improve in-context learning (ICL), or is natural text sufficient when compute is held constant (iso-FLOPs)? To test whether targeted synthetic data can accelerate induction-head emergence and enhance ICL, we introduce Bi-Induct, a lightweight curriculum that injects forward-copy (Induction), backward-copy (Anti), or a balanced mix into the pretraining stream. We train models from 0.13B to 1B parameters under iso-FLOPs, evaluating (i) few-shot ICL benchmarks, (ii) head-level telemetry, and (iii) held-out language modeling perplexity. Our findings challenge the assumption that early induction circuit activation directly improves ICL. While Bi-Induct accelerates induction-head emergence at small scales, this does not consistently yield stronger generalization. On standard LM benchmarks, Bi-Induct matches natural-only training; on function-style ICL probes, the 1B natural-only performs best. Stress tests (e.g., label permutation, HITS@1 vs. HITS@3, 1 vs. 10 shots) preserve these trends. Telemetry shows larger natural-only models develop broader, earlier induction heads without explicit induction patterns. Anti-induction data fails to elicit meaningful activation. Perplexity penalties from synthetic data shrink with scale, suggesting larger models can absorb non-natural patterns with minimal cost. Crucially, ablating the top 2% of induction heads degrades ICL more than random ablations, especially for natural-only models, indicating more centralized, load-bearing circuits. Bi-Induct variants exhibit more redundant induction activity, implying different circuit utilization. Overall, inducing activation is not sufficient: ICL gains depend on these circuits becoming functionally necessary. These results underscore mechanism-aware pretraining diagnostics and data mixtures that foster load-bearing, not merely present, structure.

Abstract: The QMoE model provides a practical approach for compression of massive Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. QMoE offers a solution geared towards memory limitations that often reach terabyte scales, and it has the advantage of working with high sparsity models which implicitly lend themselves to compression techniques. QMoE also has the advantage of only taking MoE models into account and does not evaluate its use with non mixture of expert systems. Although this prior attempt focuses on the limitations of large servers with the latest NVIDIA hardware which in the case of the H100 and V100 which have 80 GB of HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), what is not being considered is a significantly more constrained environment, such as in the case of mobile devices which may have in the case of the iPhone anywhere from 4 to 8 GB of unified memory which also needs to be shared with the operating system and additional processes. Although edge devices such as phones and laptops are becoming increasingly more computationally powerful, they are still not close to the level of advanced server machines such as NVIDIA. An additional constraint that we must consider is that of latency. The communication time of sending a request to an LLM server and then getting it back is an additional waiting time that can be removed. We may also want to use LLM technology in environments where there is no reliable network connection.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic "deadly triad" instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a "moving target" problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the DeepMind Control Benchmark.

Abstract: We introduce ADAM (A Diverse Archive of Mankind), a framework for evaluating and improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biographical reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically examine LLM capabilities in biography, a critical yet underexplored dimension of factual knowledge. At its core, AdamDB is a multilingual and multimodal dataset covering over 4 million individuals across geography, time, and profession, while AdamBench provides cognitively structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy, spanning six reasoning levels in both English and native languages. To address hallucinations, particularly for lesser-known individuals, we propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation system tailored to biographical contexts. Experiments show that AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval. ADAM establishes the first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally grounded biographical evaluation, advancing the development of multilingual, accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.

Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.

<title>MoE-PHDS: One MoE checkpoint for flexible runtime sparsity</title>

Abstract: Sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) are typically trained to operate at a fixed sparsity level, e.g. $k$ in a top-$k$ gating function. This global sparsity level determines an operating point on the accuracy/latency curve; currently, meeting multiple efficiency targets means training and maintaining multiple models. This practice complicates serving, increases training and maintenance costs, and limits flexibility in meeting diverse latency, efficiency, and energy requirements. We show that pretrained MoEs are more robust to runtime sparsity shifts than commonly assumed, and introduce MoE-PHDS ({\bf P}ost {\bf H}oc {\bf D}eclared {\bf S}parsity), a lightweight SFT method that turns a single checkpoint into a global sparsity control surface. PHDS mixes training across sparsity levels and anchors with a short curriculum at high sparsity, requiring no architectural changes. The result is predictable accuracy/latency tradeoffs from one model: practitioners can ``dial $k$'' at inference time without swapping checkpoints, changing architecture, or relying on token-level heuristics. Experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B-0125, Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, and proprietary models fit on multiple operating points show that PHDS matches or exceeds well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22\% vs. well-specified oracle models, and enables simplified, flexible runtime MoE deployment by making global sparsity a first-class serving primitive.

Abstract: Watermarking for large language models (LLMs) embeds a statistical signal during generation to enable detection of model-produced text. While watermarking has proven effective in benign settings, its robustness under adversarial evasion remains contested. To advance a rigorous understanding and evaluation of such vulnerabilities, we propose the \emph{Bias-Inversion Rewriting Attack} (BIRA), which is theoretically motivated and model-agnostic. BIRA weakens the watermark signal by suppressing the logits of likely watermarked tokens during LLM-based rewriting, without any knowledge of the underlying watermarking scheme. Across recent watermarking methods, BIRA achieves over 99\% evasion while preserving the semantic content of the original text. Beyond demonstrating an attack, our results reveal a systematic vulnerability, emphasizing the need for stress testing and robust defenses.

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay ($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase, where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness. Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but reducing generation diversity.

Abstract: The Sixth-Generation (6G) network envisions pervasive artificial intelligence (AI) as a core goal, enabled by edge intelligence through on-device data utilization. To realize this vision, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative training across edge devices. However, the sensitivity and heterogeneity of edge data pose key challenges to FL: parameter sharing risks data reconstruction, and a unified global model struggles to adapt to diverse local distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy (DP) and adaptive model design. To protect training data, we leverage sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and apply a personalized DP strategy to resist reconstruction attacks. To ensure distribution-aware adaptation under privacy constraints, we develop a privacy-aware neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm that generates locally customized architectures and hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with theoretical convergence guarantees. Our scheme achieves strong privacy guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in model performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our scheme improves accuracy by 6.82\% over the federated NAS method PerFedRLNAS, while reducing model size to 1/10 and communication cost to 1/20.

Abstract: Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario, outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1: 0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1: 0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability constraints.

Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require 300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time, maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2 dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry, achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of correspondence methods.

Abstract: Large language models face challenges in long-context question answering, where key evidence of a query may be dispersed across millions of tokens. Existing works equip large language models with a memory corpus that is dynamically updated during a single-pass document scan, also known as the "memorize while reading" methods. While this approach scales efficiently, it suffers from irreversible forward-only processing, information loss through overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals. To tackle these challenges, we present ReMemR1, a memory-augmented agent with callback-enhanced memory that allows selective retrieval from the entire memory history and allows non-linear reasoning and revisiting of early evidence. To further strengthen training, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Level Rewards (RLMLR), which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals that guide effective memory use. Together, these contributions mitigate information degradation, improve supervision, and support multi-hop memory utilizing. Experiments on long-document QA show significant gains over existing memory-based approaches, which validates ReMemR1 as an effective solution for long-context reasoning agents.

Abstract: Synthetic data refers to artificial samples generated by models. While it has been validated to significantly enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) during training and has been widely adopted in LLM development, potential security risks it may introduce remain uninvestigated. This paper systematically evaluates the resilience of synthetic-data-integrated training paradigm for LLMs against mainstream poisoning and backdoor attacks. We reveal that such a paradigm exhibits strong resistance to existing attacks, primarily thanks to the different distribution patterns between poisoning data and queries used to generate synthetic samples. To enhance the effectiveness of these attacks and further investigate the security risks introduced by synthetic data, we introduce a novel and universal attack framework, namely, Virus Infection Attack (VIA), which enables the propagation of current attacks through synthetic data even under purely clean queries. Inspired by the principles of virus design in cybersecurity, VIA conceals the poisoning payload within a protective "shell" and strategically searches for optimal hijacking points in benign samples to maximize the likelihood of generating malicious content. Extensive experiments on both data poisoning and backdoor attacks show that VIA significantly increases the presence of poisoning content in synthetic data and correspondingly raises the attack success rate (ASR) on downstream models to levels comparable to those observed in the poisoned upstream models.

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures, including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses (optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes. Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems, IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution. Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR) technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals. Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary rehabilitation in future research. The code presented in this study is available at https://github.com/ye-Kim/MMeViT.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in domains like healthcare, where data privacy is paramount. A fundamental challenge in these systems is statistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly across clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient demographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates from these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains under-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a central server not only build a model but also guide a new patient to the hospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to propose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the allocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client in the network. To enable this, we introduce an empirical likelihood-based framework that simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on each client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query. Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark datasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of client guidance compared to standard FL approaches. This work opens a new direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient federated systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature, not just a bug.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9 contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in LVLMs.

Abstract: We introduce DafnyCOMP, a benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on compositional specification generation in Dafny. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on single-function tasks, DafnyCOMP targets programs composed of multiple interacting functions with data dependencies, requiring reasoning across component boundaries. The benchmark consists of 300 automatically synthesized multi-function programs. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLM families and find that, while they perform well on single-function verification, their performance drops sharply on compositional tasks. Analysis reveals systematic failures in cross-functional reasoning, including fragile specifications, misalignment between implementations and proofs, and unstable reasoning. DafnyCOMP thus provides a diagnostic tool for measuring progress toward reliable, verifiable, and compositional code generation with LLMs.

<title>Semantic Voting: A Self-Evaluation-Free Approach for Efficient LLM Self-Improvement on Unverifiable Open-ended Tasks</title>

Abstract: The rising cost of acquiring supervised data has driven significant interest in self-improvement for large language models (LLMs). Straightforward unsupervised signals like majority voting have proven effective in generating pseudo-labels for verifiable tasks, while their applicability to unverifiable tasks (e.g., translation) is limited by the open-ended character of responses. As a result, self-evaluation mechanisms (e.g., self-judging and entropy minimization) are predominantly used to derive pseudo-labels. However, self-evaluation relying on LLMs typically incurs high computational overhead and introduces overconfidence issues due to intrinsic biases. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-evaluation-free approach for unverifiable tasks, designed for lightweight yet effective self-improvement. Inspired by majority voting commonly employed in verifiable tasks, we propose semantic voting as a novel mechanism that relaxes the principle of hard matching (i.e., exact matching) toward soft matching (i.e., semantic similarity). Soft matching is achieved by leveraging a lightweight sentence embedding model to quantify semantic similarity, thereby mitigating excessive computational burden and intrinsic bias-associated limitations of self-evaluation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency and overall better performance than self-evaluation methods across diverse model architectures and tasks.

<title>From Evidence to Trajectory: Abductive Reasoning Path Synthesis for Training Retrieval-Augmented Generation Agents</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation agents development is hindered by the lack of process-level supervision to effectively guide agentic capabilities like task decomposition, retriever invocation, and stepwise decision-making. While reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought rationales and fail to model environmental interactions. In this paper, we propose EviPath, an evidence-anchored reasoning path synthesis paradigm for RAG agent development. EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question; and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data. Extensive experiments on widely-used question-answering benchmarks show that an 8B parameter model trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of 14.7% in open-domain question answering.

<title>Beyond Model Ranking: Predictability-Aligned Evaluation for Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting, progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards. However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel, predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift, moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful, predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a deeper understanding of model behavior.

<title>Signal Preserving Weight Initialization for Odd-Sigmoid Activations</title>

Abstract: Activation functions critically influence trainability and expressivity, and recent work has therefore explored a broad range of nonlinearities. However, activations and weight initialization are interdependent: without an appropriate initialization method, nonlinearities can cause saturation, variance collapse, and increased learning rate sensitivity. We address this by defining an odd sigmoid function class and, given any activation f in this class, proposing an initialization method tailored to f. The method selects a noise scale in closed form so that forward activations remain well dispersed up to a target layer, thereby avoiding collapse to zero or saturation. Empirically, the approach trains reliably without normalization layers, exhibits strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations under which standard initialization methods (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often do not converge reliably.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and light counterfactual edits.

<title>CoPatch: Zero-Shot Referring Image Segmentation by Leveraging Untapped Spatial Knowledge in CLIP</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23098</link>

Abstract: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens. Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language, \textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+ 2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in zero-shot RIS.

Abstract: Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure, decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection. Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.

Abstract: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations. We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet, and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards efficient deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Teleoperation via natural-language reduces operator workload and enhances safety in high-risk or remote settings. However, in dynamic remote scenes, transmission latency during bidirectional communication creates gaps between remote perceived states and operator intent, leading to command misunderstanding and incorrect execution. To mitigate this, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph (ST-OVSG), a representation that enriches open-vocabulary perception with temporal dynamics and lightweight latency annotations. ST-OVSG leverages LVLMs to construct open-vocabulary 3D object representations, and extends them into the temporal domain via Hungarian assignment with our temporal matching cost, yielding a unified spatio-temporal scene graph. A latency tag is embedded to enable LVLM planners to retrospectively query past scene states, thereby resolving local-remote state mismatches caused by transmission delays. To further reduce redundancy and highlight task-relevant cues, we propose a task-oriented subgraph filtering strategy that produces compact inputs for the planner. ST-OVSG generalizes to novel categories and enhances planning robustness against transmission latency without requiring fine-tuning. Experiments show that our method achieves 74 percent node accuracy on the Replica benchmark, outperforming ConceptGraph. Notably, in the latency-robustness experiment, the LVLM planner assisted by ST-OVSG achieved a planning success rate of 70.5 percent.

Abstract: In Industry 4.0 applications, dynamic environmental interference induces highly nonlinear and strongly coupled interactions between the environmental state and robotic behavior. Effectively representing dynamic environmental states through multimodal sensor data fusion remains a critical challenge in current robotic datasets. To address this, an industrial-grade multimodal interference dataset is presented, designed for robotic perception and control under complex conditions. The dataset integrates multi-dimensional interference features including size, color, and lighting variations, and employs high-precision sensors to synchronously collect visual, torque, and joint-state measurements. Scenarios with geometric similarity exceeding 85\% and standardized lighting gradients are included to ensure real-world representativeness. Microsecond-level time-synchronization and vibration-resistant data acquisition protocols, implemented via the Robot Operating System (ROS), guarantee temporal and operational fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that the dataset enhances model validation robustness and improves robotic operational stability in dynamic, interference-rich environments. The dataset is publicly available at:https://modelscope.cn/datasets/Liaoh_LAB/Liaohe-CobotMagic-PnP.

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility), a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies, thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a 5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/he-h/rhythm.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle, we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at https://github.com/HaotianLiu123/CCGSPG.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) learns a reward function to explain expert demonstrations. Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax) formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward RL. Empirically, PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward recovery, policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo and Gym-Robotics benchmarks and a real-world animal behavior modeling task.

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive impairment is critical for timely diagnosis and intervention, yet infrequent clinical assessments often lack the sensitivity and temporal resolution to capture subtle cognitive declines in older adults. Passive smartphone sensing has emerged as a promising approach for naturalistic and continuous cognitive monitoring. Building on this potential, we implemented a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect cognitive impairment from sequences of daily behavioral features, derived from multimodal sensing data collected in an ongoing one-year study of older adults. Our key contributions are two techniques to enhance model generalizability across participants: (1) routine-aware augmentation, which generates synthetic sequences by replacing each day with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic personalization, which reweights training samples to emphasize those from individuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluated on 6-month data from 36 older adults, these techniques jointly improved the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of the model trained on sensing and demographic features from 0.637 to 0.766, highlighting the potential of scalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations with passive sensing.

Abstract: Dense associative memories (DAMs) store and retrieve patterns via energy-functional fixed points, but existing models are limited to vector representations. We extend DAMs to probability distributions equipped with the 2-Wasserstein distance, focusing mainly on the Bures-Wasserstein class of Gaussian densities. Our framework defines a log-sum-exp energy over stored distributions and a retrieval dynamics aggregating optimal transport maps in a Gibbs-weighted manner. Stationary points correspond to self-consistent Wasserstein barycenters, generalizing classical DAM fixed points. We prove exponential storage capacity, provide quantitative retrieval guarantees under Wasserstein perturbations, and validate the model on synthetic and real-world distributional tasks. This work elevates associative memory from vectors to full distributions, bridging classical DAMs with modern generative modeling and enabling distributional storage and retrieval in memory-augmented learning.

Abstract: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end, video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting systems, paving the way for machine vision to replace legacy roadside infrastructure.

Abstract: With the emergence of Web 2.0 and microservices architecture, the number of Web APIs has increased dramatically, further intensifying the demand for efficient Web API recommendation. Existing solutions typically fall into two categories: recommendation-type methods, which treat each API as a label for classification, and match-type methods, which focus on matching mashups through API retrieval. However, three critical challenges persist: 1) the semantic ambiguities in comparing API and mashup descriptions, 2) the lack of detailed comparisons between the individual API and the mashup in recommendation-type methods, and 3) time inefficiencies for API retrieval in match-type methods. To address these challenges, we propose WARBERT, a hierarchical BERT-based model for Web API recommendation. WARBERT leverages dual-component feature fusion and attention comparison to extract precise semantic representations of API and mashup descriptions. WARBERT consists of two main components: WARBERT(R) for Recommendation and WARBERT(M) for Matching. Specifically, WAR-BERT(R) serves as an initial filter, narrowing down the candidate APIs, while WARBERT(M) refines the matching process by calculating the similarity between candidate APIs and mashup. The final likelihood of a mashup being matched with an API is determined by combining the predictions from WARBERT(R) and WARBERT(M). Additionally, WARBERT(R) incorporates an auxiliary task of mashup category judgment, which enhances its effectiveness in candidate selection. Experimental results on the ProgrammableWeb dataset demonstrate that WARBERT outperforms most existing solutions and achieves improvements of up to 11.7% compared to the model MTFM (Multi-Task Fusion Model), delivering significant enhancements in accuracy and effiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success in single-turn function calling, yet real-world applications such as travel planning or multi-stage data analysis typically unfold across multi-turn conversations. In these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion. Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function calling.

<title>Towards Monotonic Improvement in In-Context Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing agents that can rapidly adapt to new tasks by leveraging past experiences as context, without updating their parameters. Recent approaches train large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online RL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our experimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a continue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically, we identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own stochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly resembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a vicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we introduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed ICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing the ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current context. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant information, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We prove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap relative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two methods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time. Experiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that CV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL abilities across various tasks and environments.

Abstract: Understanding causality in event sequences with thousands of sparse event types is critical in domains such as healthcare, cybersecurity, or vehicle diagnostics, yet current methods fail to scale. We present OSCAR, a one-shot causal autoregressive method that infers per-sequence Markov Boundaries using two pretrained Transformers as density estimators. This enables efficient, parallel causal discovery without costly global CI testing. On a real-world automotive dataset with 29,100 events and 474 labels, OSCAR recovers interpretable causal structures in minutes, while classical methods fail to scale, enabling practical scientific diagnostics at production scale.

<title>Leave No Observation Behind: Real-time Correction for VLA Action Chunks</title>

Abstract: To improve efficiency and temporal coherence, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often predict action chunks; however, this action chunking harms reactivity under inference delay and long horizons. We introduce Asynchronous Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest observation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the base model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23% point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in real-time control.

<title>SPEC-RL: Accelerating On-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Speculative Rollouts</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization, objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations. We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500, OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large reasoning models.

<title>Patch Rebirth: Toward Fast and Transferable Model Inversion of Vision Transformers</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23235</link>

Abstract: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer, along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect, thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge. Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

<title>Self-Consistency as a Free Lunch: Reducing Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models via Self-Reflection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses, which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER, MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

Abstract: Goal Recognition (GR) is the task of inferring an agent's intended goal from partial observations of its behavior, typically in an online and one-shot setting. Despite recent advances in model-free GR, particularly in applications such as human-robot interaction, surveillance, and assistive systems, the field remains fragmented due to inconsistencies in benchmarks, domains, and evaluation protocols.
  To address this, we introduce gr-libs (https://github.com/MatanShamir1/gr_libs) and gr-envs (https://github.com/MatanShamir1/gr_envs), two complementary open-source frameworks that support the development, evaluation, and comparison of GR algorithms in Gym-compatible environments. gr-libs includes modular implementations of MDP-based GR baselines, diagnostic tools, and evaluation utilities. gr-envs provides a curated suite of environments adapted for dynamic and goal-directed behavior, along with wrappers that ensure compatibility with standard reinforcement learning toolkits. Together, these libraries offer a standardized, extensible, and reproducible platform for advancing GR research. Both packages are open-source and available on GitHub and PyPI.

<title>Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy for LLMs: Not All Tokens Require Equal Protection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive or personal information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing variants of differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) inject uniform noise into every gradient step, significantly extending training time and reducing model accuracy. We propose that concentrating noise primarily on gradients associated with sensitive tokens can substantially decrease DP training time, strengthen the protection of sensitive information, and simultaneously preserve the model's performance on non-sensitive data. We operationalize this insight through Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of vanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive and non-sensitive tokens. By employing a larger noise scale at the early stage of training, ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content. As a result, ATDP only requires a few additional epochs of lightweight post-processing following standard fine-tuning, injecting targeted noise primarily on parameters corresponding to sensitive tokens, thus minimally affecting the model's general capabilities. ATDP can be seamlessly integrated into any existing DP-based fine-tuning pipeline or directly applied to non-private models as a fast privacy-enhancing measure. Additionally, combined with an initial redacted fine-tuning phase, ATDP forms a streamlined DP pipeline that achieves comparable canary protection to state-of-the-art DP-SGD methods, significantly reduces the computational overhead of DP fine-tuning, shortening training time by approximately 90 percent, while achieving comparable or superior privacy protection and minimal accuracy degradation.

Abstract: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture, relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against misuse of I2V generation models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) by employing continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a linear-quadratic (LQ) formulation that incorporates both interim and terminal objectives. We develop a model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm tailored to ALM for dynamically synchronizing assets and liabilities. To ensure an effective balance between exploration and exploitation with minimal tuning, we introduce adaptive exploration for the actor and scheduled exploration for the critic. Our empirical study evaluates this approach against two enhanced traditional financial strategies, a model-based continuous-time RL method, and three state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Evaluated across 200 randomized market scenarios, our method achieves higher average rewards than all alternative strategies, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance. The outperformance stems not from complex neural networks or improved parameter estimation, but from directly learning the optimal ALM strategy without learning the environment.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) enable any-order generation, but this flexibility enlarges the attack surface: harmful spans may appear at arbitrary positions, and template-based prefilling attacks such as DIJA bypass response-level refusals. We introduce A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal whenever harmful content arises. By aligning safety directly at the token-level under randomized masking, A2D achieves robustness to both any-decoding-order and any-step prefilling attacks under various conditions. It also enables real-time monitoring: dLLMs may begin a response but automatically terminate if unsafe continuation emerges. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently prevents the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), and thresholded [EOS] probabilities allow early rejection, yielding up to 19.3x faster safe termination.

Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction is critical for air traffic management, airline operations, and environmental assessment. This paper introduces NODE-FDM, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Flight Dynamics Model trained on Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. By combining analytical kinematic relations with data-driven components, NODE-FDM achieves a more accurate reproduction of recorded trajectories than state-of-the-art models such as a BADA-based trajectory generation methodology (BADA4 performance model combined with trajectory control routines), particularly in the descent phase of the flight. The analysis demonstrates marked improvements across altitude, speed, and mass dynamics. Despite current limitations, including limited physical constraints and the limited availability of QAR data, the results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed neural ordinary differential equations as a high-fidelity, data-driven approach to aircraft performance modelling. Future work will extend the framework to incorporate a full modelling of the lateral dynamics of the aircraft.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Abstract: Regression is essential across many domains but remains challenging in high-dimensional settings, where existing methods often lose spatial structure or demand heavy storage. In this work, we address the problem of matrix-valued regression, where each sample is naturally represented as a matrix. We propose MELCOT, a hybrid model that integrates a classical machine learning-based Marginal Estimation (ME) block with a deep learning-based Learnable-Cost Optimal Transport (LCOT) block. The ME block estimates data marginals to preserve spatial information, while the LCOT block learns complex global features. This design enables MELCOT to inherit the strengths of both classical and deep learning methods. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and domains demonstrate that MELCOT consistently outperforms all baselines while remaining highly efficient.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on mobile devices faces the challenge of insufficient performance in smaller models and excessive resource consumption in larger ones. This paper highlights that mobile Neural Processing Units (NPUs) have underutilized computational resources, particularly their matrix multiplication units, during typical LLM inference. To leverage this wasted compute capacity, we propose applying parallel test-time scaling techniques on mobile NPUs to enhance the performance of smaller LLMs. However, this approach confronts inherent NPU challenges, including inadequate hardware support for fine-grained quantization and low efficiency in general-purpose computations. To overcome these, we introduce two key techniques: a hardware-aware tile quantization scheme that aligns group quantization with NPU memory access patterns, and efficient LUT-based replacements for complex operations such as Softmax and dequantization. We design and implement an end-to-end inference system that leverages the NPU's compute capability to support test-time scaling on Qualcomm Snapdragon platforms. Experiments show our approach brings significant speedups: up to 19.0 for mixed-precision GEMM and 2.2 for Softmax. More importantly, we demonstrate that smaller models using test-time scaling can match or exceed the accuracy of larger models, achieving a new performance-cost Pareto frontier.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer. Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected robustness.

Abstract: The growing ambition for space exploration demands robust autonomous systems that can operate in unstructured environments under extreme extraterrestrial conditions. The adoption of robot learning in this domain is severely hindered by the prohibitive cost of technology demonstrations and the limited availability of data. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Space Robotics Bench, an open-source simulation framework for robot learning in space. It offers a modular architecture that integrates on-demand procedural generation with massively parallel simulation environments to support the creation of vast and diverse training distributions for learning-based agents. To ground research and enable direct comparison, the framework includes a comprehensive suite of benchmark tasks that span a wide range of mission-relevant scenarios. We establish performance baselines using standard reinforcement learning algorithms and present a series of experimental case studies that investigate key challenges in generalization, end-to-end learning, adaptive control, and sim-to-real transfer. Our results reveal insights into the limitations of current methods and demonstrate the utility of the framework in producing policies capable of real-world operation. These contributions establish the Space Robotics Bench as a valuable resource for developing, benchmarking, and deploying the robust autonomous systems required for the final frontier.

However, another closely related problem, Cross-System SQL Translation (a.k.a., SQL-to-SQL), which adapts a query written for one database system (e.g., MySQL) into its equivalent one for another system (e.g., ClickHouse), is of great practical importance but remains underexplored. Existing SQL benchmarks are not well-suited for SQL-to-SQL evaluation, which (1) focus on a limited set of database systems (often just SQLite) and (2) cannot capture many system-specific SQL dialects (e.g., customized functions, data types, and syntax rules). Thus, in this paper, we introduce PARROT, a Practical And Realistic BenchmaRk for CrOss-System SQL Translation. PARROT comprises 598 translation pairs from 38 open-source benchmarks and real-world business services, specifically prepared to challenge system-specific SQL understanding (e.g., LLMS achieve lower than 38.53% accuracy on average). We also provide multiple benchmark variants, including PARROT-Diverse with 28,003 translations (for extensive syntax testing) and PARROT-Simple with 5,306 representative samples (for focused stress testing), covering 22 production-grade database systems. To promote future research, we release a public leaderboard and source code at: https://code4db.github.io/parrot-bench/.

Abstract: Diagnosing and managing oral diseases necessitate advanced visual interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis. DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of 110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36 diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946 patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12 senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios, including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to specialized medical expertise within the field of dentistry.

Abstract: As large language models continue to develop, the feasibility and significance of text-based symbolic music tasks have become increasingly prominent. While symbolic music has been widely used in generation tasks, LLM capabilities in understanding and reasoning about symbolic music remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose ABC-Eval, the first open-source benchmark dedicated to the understanding and instruction-following capabilities in text-based ABC notation scores. It comprises 1,086 test samples spanning 10 sub-tasks, covering scenarios from basic musical syntax comprehension to complex sequence-level reasoning. Such a diverse scope poses substantial challenges to models' ability to handle symbolic music tasks. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art LLMs on ABC-Eval, and the results reveal notable limitations in existing models' symbolic music processing capabilities. Furthermore, the consistent performance of individual baselines across different sub-tasks supports the reliability of our benchmark.

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM) rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

<title>Dual-Space Smoothness for Robust and Balanced LLM Unlearning</title>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models, Machine Unlearning has emerged to address growing concerns around user privacy, copyright infringement, and overall safety. Yet state-of-the-art (SOTA) unlearning methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and metric imbalance, for example by over-optimizing one objective (e.g., unlearning effectiveness, utility preservation, or privacy protection) at the expense of others. In addition, small perturbations in the representation or parameter space can be exploited by relearn and jailbreak attacks. To address these challenges, we propose PRISM, a unified framework that enforces dual-space smoothness in representation and parameter spaces to improve robustness and balance unlearning metrics. PRISM consists of two smoothness optimization stages: (i) a representation space stage that employs a robustly trained probe to defend against jailbreak attacks, and (ii) a parameter-space stage that decouples retain-forget gradient conflicts, reduces imbalance, and smooths the parameter space to mitigate relearning attacks. Extensive experiments on WMDP and MUSE, across conversational-dialogue and continuous-text settings, show that PRISM outperforms SOTA baselines under multiple attacks while achieving a better balance among key metrics.

<title>AI Education in Higher Education: A Taxonomy for Curriculum Reform and the Mission of Knowledge</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping higher education, yet current debates often feel tangled, mixing concerns about pedagogy, operations, curriculum, and the future of work without a shared framework. This paper offers a first attempt at a taxonomy to organize the diverse narratives of AI education and to inform discipline-based curricular discussions. We place these narratives within the enduring responsibility of higher education: the mission of knowledge. This mission includes not only the preservation and advancement of disciplinary expertise, but also the cultivation of skills and wisdom, i.e., forms of meta-knowledge that encompass judgment, ethics, and social responsibility. For the purpose of this paper's discussion, AI is defined as adaptive, data-driven systems that automate analysis, modeling, and decision-making, highlighting its dual role as enabler and disruptor across disciplines. We argue that the most consequential challenges lie at the level of curriculum and disciplinary purpose, where AI accelerates inquiry but also unsettles expertise and identity. We show how disciplines evolve through the interplay of research, curriculum, pedagogy, and faculty expertise, and why curricular reform is the central lever for meaningful change. Pedagogical innovation offers a strategic and accessible entry point, providing actionable steps that help faculty and students build the expertise needed to engage in deeper curricular rethinking and disciplinary renewal. Within this framing, we suggest that meaningful reform can move forward through structured faculty journeys: from AI literacy to pedagogy, curriculum design, and research integration. The key is to align these journeys with the mission of knowledge, turning the disruptive pressures of AI into opportunities for disciplines to sustain expertise, advance inquiry, and serve society.

Abstract: In the field of medicine, complex reasoning tasks such as clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and medical knowledge integration pose significant challenges, where small language models often underperform compared to large language models like GPT-4 and Deepseek. Recent knowledge distillation-based methods aim to address these issues through teacher-guided error correction, but this LLM as judge approach remains challenging in terms of cost, time, and efficiency. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel two-stage framework, MedCritical, which uses a small language model fine-tuned by a large teacher model to play against itself. In the first stage, we extract high-level and detailed long-chain thought templates from the teacher model to guide the student model to generate more complex reasoning thoughts. In the second stage, we introduce direct preference optimization (DPO) through model self-iteration collaboration to enhance the reasoning ability of the student model by playing against the correction trajectory of the fine-tuned model during training. This model self-learning DPO approach teaches the student model to use its own error-driven insights to consolidate its skills and knowledge to solve complex problems, and achieves comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation methods using teacher models at a lower cost. Notably, our MedCritical 7B model outperforms the Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04\% and 10.12\% respectively on the CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among 7B-class small models.

<title>Alignment through Meta-Weighted Online Sampling: Bridging the Gap between Data Generation and Preference Optimization</title>

Abstract: Preference optimization is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and intentions. A significant challenge in this process is the distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the evolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static heuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to adapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework that dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a lightweight meta-learner, as an "alignment gap estimator", to evaluate the potential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This guides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the optimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of online and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench demonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference optimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online annotation costs.

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths. Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior, acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes. This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction structure.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that controlled pretraining experiments are a powerful tool for understanding learning, reasoning, and memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, the computational cost of pretraining presents a significant constraint. To overcome this constraint, we propose to conduct multiple pretraining experiments simultaneously during a single training run. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by conducting ten experiments during the training of a 1.5B parameter model on 210B tokens. Although we only train a single model, we can replicate the results from multiple previous works on data contamination, poisoning, and memorization. We also conduct novel investigations into knowledge acquisition, mathematical reasoning, and watermarking. For example, we dynamically update the training data until the model acquires a particular piece of knowledge. Remarkably, the influence of the ten experiments on the model's training dynamics and overall performance is minimal. However, interactions between different experiments may act as a potential confounder in our approach. We propose to test for interactions with continual pretraining experiments, finding them to be negligible in our setup. Overall, our findings suggest that performing multiple pretraining experiments in a single training run can enable rigorous scientific experimentation with large models on a compute budget.

Abstract: Fracture detection plays a critical role in medical imaging analysis, traditional fracture diagnosis relies on visual assessment by experienced physicians, however the speed and accuracy of this approach are constrained by the expertise. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, deep learning models based on the YOLO framework have been widely employed for fracture detection, demonstrating significant potential in improving diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. This study proposes an improved YOLO-based model, termed Fracture-YOLO, which integrates novel Critical-Region-Selector Attention (CRSelector) and Scale-Aware (ScA) heads to further enhance detection performance. Specifically, the CRSelector module utilizes global texture information to focus on critical features of fracture regions. Meanwhile, the ScA module dynamically adjusts the weights of features at different scales, enhancing the model's capacity to identify fracture targets at multiple scales. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline model, Fracture-YOLO achieves a significant improvement in detection precision, with mAP50 and mAP50-95 increasing by 4 and 3, surpassing the baseline model and achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

arXiv:2509.23410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur prohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an effective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face challenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere, preserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU acceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap, we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles, assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU, PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning method, MaskLLM.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel community detection method that integrates the Louvain algorithm with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), enabling the discovery of communities without prior knowledge. Compared to most existing solutions, the proposed method does not require prior knowledge of the number of communities. It enhances the Louvain algorithm using node embeddings generated by a GNN to capture richer structural and feature information. Furthermore, it introduces a merging algorithm to refine the results of the enhanced Louvain algorithm, reducing the number of detected communities. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one that improves the Louvain algorithm using GNNs for community detection. The improvement of the proposed method was empirically confirmed through an evaluation on real-world datasets. The results demonstrate its ability to dynamically adjust the number of detected communities and increase the detection accuracy in comparison with the benchmark solutions.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, but often produce answers judged as incorrect. We hypothesize that many of these answers are actually correct, but are expressed in alternative surface forms that are dismissed due to an overly strict evaluation, leading to an underestimation of models' parametric knowledge. We propose Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD), a decoding strategy that restricts model outputs to unique surface forms. We introduce YAGO-QA, a dataset of 19,137 general knowledge questions. Evaluating open-source LMs from 135M to 70B parameters, we show that standard decoding undervalues their knowledge. For instance, Llama-3.1-70B scores only 32.3% F1 with vanilla decoding but 46.0% with RCD. Similarly, Llama-3.1-8B reaches 33.0% with RCD, outperforming the larger model under vanilla decoding. We publicly share the code and dataset at https://github.com/Rajjaa/disambiguated-LLM.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables participant devices to collaboratively train deep learning models without sharing their data with the server or other devices, effectively addressing data privacy and computational concerns. However, FL faces a major bottleneck due to high communication overhead from frequent model updates between devices and the server, limiting deployment in resource-constrained wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a three-fold strategy. Firstly, an Adaptive Feature-Elimination Strategy to drop less important features while retaining high-value ones; secondly, Adaptive Gradient Innovation and Error Sensitivity-Based Quantization, which dynamically adjusts the quantization level for innovative gradient compression; and thirdly, Communication Frequency Optimization to enhance communication efficiency. We evaluated our proposed model's performance through extensive experiments, assessing accuracy, loss, and convergence compared to baseline techniques. The results show that our model achieves high communication efficiency in the framework while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Communication challenges between autistic and neurotypical individuals stem from a mutual lack of understanding of each other's distinct, and often contrasting, communication styles. Yet, autistic individuals are expected to adapt to neurotypical norms, making interactions inauthentic and mentally exhausting for them. To help redress this imbalance, we build NeuroBridge, an online platform that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to simulate: (a) an AI character that is direct and literal, a style common among many autistic individuals, and (b) four cross-neurotype communication scenarios in a feedback-driven conversation between this character and a neurotypical user. Through NeuroBridge, neurotypical individuals gain a firsthand look at autistic communication, and reflect on their role in shaping cross-neurotype interactions. In a user study with 12 neurotypical participants, we find that NeuroBridge improved their understanding of how autistic people may interpret language differently, with all describing autism as a social difference that "needs understanding by others" after completing the simulation. Participants valued its personalized, interactive format and described AI-generated feedback as "constructive", "logical" and "non-judgmental". Most perceived the portrayal of autism in the simulation as accurate, suggesting that users may readily accept AI-generated (mis)representations of disabilities. To conclude, we discuss design implications for disability representation in AI, the need for making NeuroBridge more personalized, and LLMs' limitations in modeling complex social scenarios.

Abstract: The creation of high-quality multimodal datasets remains fundamental for advancing role-playing capabilities in large language models (LLMs). While existing works predominantly focus on text-based persona simulation, Audio Role-Playing (ARP) presents unique challenges due to the need for synchronized alignment of semantic content and vocal characteristics. To address this gap, we propose AudioRole, a meticulously curated dataset from 13 TV series spanning 1K+ hours with 1M+ character-grounded dialogues, providing synchronized audio-text pairs annotated with speaker identities and contextual metadata. In addition, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset, we introduced ARP-Eval, a dual-aspect evaluation framework that assesses both response quality and role fidelity. Empirical validation showing GLM-4-Voice trained on AudioRole (which we called ARP-Model) achieve an average Acoustic Personalization score of 0.31, significantly outperforming the original GLM-4-voice and the more powerful model MiniCPM-O-2.6, which specifically supports role-playing in one-shot scenarios. The ARP-Model also achieves a Content Personalization score of 0.36, surpassing the untrained original model by about 38% and maintaining the same level as MiniCPM-O-2.6.
  AudioRole features dialogues from over 115 main characters, 6 trained ARP-Models that role-play different characters, and evaluation protocols. Together, they provide an essential resource for advancing audio-grounded role-playing research.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks have become a cornerstone of medical image analysis due to their proficiency in learning hierarchical spatial features. However, this focus on a single domain is inefficient at capturing global, holistic patterns and fails to explicitly model an image's frequency-domain characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network (S$^3$F-Net), a dual-branch framework that learns from both spatial and spectral representations simultaneously. The S$^3$F-Net performs a fusion of a deep spatial CNN with our proposed shallow spectral encoder, SpectraNet. SpectraNet features the proposed SpectralFilter layer, which leverages the Convolution Theorem by applying a bank of learnable filters directly to an image's full Fourier spectrum via a computation-efficient element-wise multiplication. This allows the SpectralFilter layer to attain a global receptive field instantaneously, with its output being distilled by a lightweight summarizer network. We evaluate S$^3$F-Net across four medical imaging datasets spanning different modalities to validate its efficacy and generalizability. Our framework consistently and significantly outperforms its strong spatial-only baseline in all cases, with accuracy improvements of up to 5.13%. With a powerful Bilinear Fusion, S$^3$F-Net achieves a SOTA competitive accuracy of 98.76% on the BRISC2025 dataset. Concatenation Fusion performs better on the texture-dominant Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset, achieving 93.11% accuracy, surpassing many top-performing, much deeper models. Our explainability analysis also reveals that the S$^3$F-Net learns to dynamically adjust its reliance on each branch based on the input pathology. These results verify that our dual-domain approach is a powerful and generalizable paradigm for medical image analysis.

Abstract: The imperative of user privacy protection and regulatory compliance necessitates sensitive data removal in model training, yet this process often induces distributional shifts that undermine model performance-particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We propose a novel data removal approach that enhances deep predictive models through factor decorrelation and loss perturbation. Our approach introduces: (1) a discriminative-preserving factor decorrelation module employing dynamic adaptive weight adjustment and iterative representation updating to reduce feature redundancy and minimize inter-feature correlations. (2) a smoothed data removal mechanism with loss perturbation that creates information-theoretic safeguards against data leakage during removal operations. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms other baselines and consistently achieves high predictive accuracy and robustness even under significant distribution shifts. The results highlight its superior efficiency and adaptability in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

<title>AudioFuse: Unified Spectral-Temporal Learning via a Hybrid ViT-1D CNN Architecture for Robust Phonocardiogram Classification</title>

Abstract: Biomedical audio signals, such as phonocardiograms (PCG), are inherently rhythmic and contain diagnostic information in both their spectral (tonal) and temporal domains. Standard 2D spectrograms provide rich spectral features but compromise the phase information and temporal precision of the 1D waveform. We propose AudioFuse, an architecture that simultaneously learns from both complementary representations to classify PCGs. To mitigate the overfitting risk common in fusion models, we integrate a custom, wide-and-shallow Vision Transformer (ViT) for spectrograms with a shallow 1D CNN for raw waveforms. On the PhysioNet 2016 dataset, AudioFuse achieves a state-of-the-art competitive ROC-AUC of 0.8608 when trained from scratch, outperforming its spectrogram (0.8066) and waveform (0.8223) baselines. Moreover, it demonstrates superior robustness to domain shift on the challenging PASCAL dataset, maintaining an ROC-AUC of 0.7181 while the spectrogram baseline collapses (0.4873). Fusing complementary representations thus provides a strong inductive bias, enabling the creation of efficient, generalizable classifiers without requiring large-scale pre-training.

Abstract: Data selection is designed to accelerate learning with preserved performance. To achieve this, a fundamental thought is to identify informative data samples with significant contributions to the training. In this work, we propose \textbf{Evolved Sampling} (\textbf{ES}), a simple yet effective framework for \emph{dynamic} sampling along the training process. This method conducts \em batch \em level data selection based on the dynamics of losses and augmented \emph{loss differences}, which enables flexible \emph{frequency tuning}, and hence significantly reduces the back propagation time with maintained model performance. Due to its conciseness, ES is also readily extensible to incorporate \em set \em level data selection (to form ES with pruning, \textbf{ESWP}) for further accelerations. As a plug-and-play framework, ES(WP) consistently achieves lossless training accelerations across various pre-training and post-training tasks, saving up to nearly 45\% wall-clock time. Our results motivate further investigations on the data efficiency aspect of modern large-scale machine learning.

Abstract: Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains a central challenge for AI. Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs. We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts, multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster, has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.

Abstract: Effectively integrating diverse sensory modalities is crucial for robotic manipulation. However, the typical approach of feature concatenation is often suboptimal: dominant modalities such as vision can overwhelm sparse but critical signals like touch in contact-rich tasks, and monolithic architectures cannot flexibly incorporate new or missing modalities without retraining. Our method factorizes the policy into a set of diffusion models, each specialized for a single representation (e.g., vision or touch), and employs a router network that learns consensus weights to adaptively combine their contributions, enabling incremental of new representations. We evaluate our approach on simulated manipulation tasks in {RLBench}, as well as real-world tasks such as occluded object picking, in-hand spoon reorientation, and puzzle insertion, where it significantly outperforms feature-concatenation baselines on scenarios requiring multimodal reasoning. Our policy further demonstrates robustness to physical perturbations and sensor corruption. We further conduct perturbation-based importance analysis, which reveals adaptive shifts between modalities.

<title>Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning via Low-Rank Activation Compression</title>

Abstract: The parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm has garnered significant attention with the advancement of foundation models. Although numerous methods have been proposed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, their substantial memory overhead remains a critical bottleneck that hinders practical deployment. In this paper, we observe that model activations constitute a major source of memory consumption, especially under large batch sizes and long context lengths; however, the rank of the activations remains consistently low. Motivated by this insight, we propose a memory-efficient fine-tuning approach Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct). Unlike prior work, LoRAct provides a more flexible and versatile compressing strategy that can be applied online during the forward pass without the need for any calibration data. Moreover, LoRAct incorporates a novel sampling-based orthogonal decomposition algorithm specifically designed for low-rank matrices, offering improved computational efficiency and a tighter error bound compared to the widely used RSVD. Experiments on both vision and language tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAct. Notably, LoRAct further reduces activation memory by approximately 80% in comparison with the widely adopted LoRA method, while maintaining competitive performance.

<title>Text-Based Approaches to Item Difficulty Modeling in Large-Scale Assessments: A Systematic Review</title>

Abstract: Item difficulty plays a crucial role in test performance, interpretability of scores, and equity for all test-takers, especially in large-scale assessments. Traditional approaches to item difficulty modeling rely on field testing and classical test theory (CTT)-based item analysis or item response theory (IRT) calibration, which can be time-consuming and costly. To overcome these challenges, text-based approaches leveraging machine learning and language models, have emerged as promising alternatives. This paper reviews and synthesizes 37 articles on automated item difficulty prediction in large-scale assessment settings published through May 2025. For each study, we delineate the dataset, difficulty parameter, subject domain, item type, number of items, training and test data split, input, features, model, evaluation criteria, and model performance outcomes. Results showed that although classic machine learning models remain relevant due to their interpretability, state-of-the-art language models, using both small and large transformer-based architectures, can capture syntactic and semantic patterns without the need for manual feature engineering. Uniquely, model performance outcomes were summarized to serve as a benchmark for future research and overall, text-based methods have the potential to predict item difficulty with root mean square error (RMSE) as low as 0.165, Pearson correlation as high as 0.87, and accuracy as high as 0.806. The review concludes by discussing implications for practice and outlining future research directions for automated item difficulty modeling.

<title>Revisiting Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values</title>

Abstract: Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/CRIB.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate predictions based on prompts without additional fine-tuning. While prompt engineering has been widely studied, the impact of role design within prompts remains underexplored. This study examines the influence of role configurations in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o from OpenAI and Llama2-7b and Llama2-13b from Meta. We evaluate the models' performance across datasets, focusing on tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, question answering, and math reasoning. Our findings suggest the potential of role-based prompt structuring to enhance LLM performance.

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module, iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

<title>From Human Annotation to Automation: LLM-in-the-Loop Active Learning for Arabic Sentiment Analysis</title>

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP), particularly sentiment analysis, plays a vital role in areas like marketing, customer service, and social media monitoring by providing insights into user opinions and emotions. However, progress in Arabic sentiment analysis remains limited due to the lack of large, high-quality labeled datasets. While active learning has proven effective in reducing annotation efforts in other languages, few studies have explored it in Arabic sentiment tasks. Likewise, the use of large language models (LLMs) for assisting annotation and comparing their performance to human labeling is still largely unexplored in the Arabic context. In this paper, we propose an active learning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis designed to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance. We evaluate multiple deep learning architectures: Specifically, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRU), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), across three benchmark datasets: Hunger Station, AJGT, and MASAC, encompassing both modern standard Arabic and dialectal variations. Additionally, two annotation strategies are compared: Human labeling and LLM-assisted labeling. Five LLMs are evaluated as annotators: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek Chat, and LLaMA 3 70B Instruct. For each dataset, the best-performing LLM was used: GPT-4o for Hunger Station, Claude 3 Sonnet for AJGT, and DeepSeek Chat for MASAC. Our results show that LLM-assisted active learning achieves competitive or superior performance compared to human labeling. For example, on the Hunger Station dataset, the LSTM model achieved 93% accuracy with only 450 labeled samples using GPT-4o-generated labels, while on the MASAC dataset, DeepSeek Chat reached 82% accuracy with 650 labeled samples, matching the accuracy obtained through human labeling.

Abstract: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps in action and spatiotemporal understanding.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models by grounding their outputs in external documents. These systems, however, remain vulnerable to attacks on the retrieval corpus, such as prompt injection. RAG-based search systems (e.g., Google's Search AI Overview) present an interesting setting for studying and protecting against such threats, as defense algorithms can benefit from built-in reliability signals -- like document ranking -- and represent a non-LLM challenge for the adversary due to decades of work to thwart SEO.
  Motivated by, but not limited to, this scenario, this work introduces ReliabilityRAG, a framework for adversarial robustness that explicitly leverages reliability information of retrieved documents.
  Our first contribution adopts a graph-theoretic perspective to identify a "consistent majority" among retrieved documents to filter out malicious ones. We introduce a novel algorithm based on finding a Maximum Independent Set (MIS) on a document graph where edges encode contradiction. Our MIS variant explicitly prioritizes higher-reliability documents and provides provable robustness guarantees against bounded adversarial corruption under natural assumptions. Recognizing the computational cost of exact MIS for large retrieval sets, our second contribution is a scalable weighted sample and aggregate framework. It explicitly utilizes reliability information, preserving some robustness guarantees while efficiently handling many documents.
  We present empirical results showing ReliabilityRAG provides superior robustness against adversarial attacks compared to prior methods, maintains high benign accuracy, and excels in long-form generation tasks where prior robustness-focused methods struggled. Our work is a significant step towards more effective, provably robust defenses against retrieved corpus corruption in RAG.

Abstract: AI creates and exacerbates privacy risks, yet practitioners lack effective resources to identify and mitigate these risks. We present Privy, a tool that guides practitioners through structured privacy impact assessments to: (i) identify relevant risks in novel AI product concepts, and (ii) propose appropriate mitigations. Privy was shaped by a formative study with 11 practitioners, which informed two versions -- one LLM-powered, the other template-based. We evaluated these two versions of Privy through a between-subjects, controlled study with 24 separate practitioners, whose assessments were reviewed by 13 independent privacy experts. Results show that Privy helps practitioners produce privacy assessments that experts deemed high quality: practitioners identified relevant risks and proposed appropriate mitigation strategies. These effects were augmented in the LLM-powered version. Practitioners themselves rated Privy as being useful and usable, and their feedback illustrates how it helps overcome long-standing awareness, motivation, and ability barriers in privacy work.

Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three, and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-, three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of both radiomics and deep learning computational methods to improve early detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, marking a significant advancement in the literature.

<title>On the Shelf Life of Fine-Tuned LLM Judges: Future Proofing, Backward Compatibility, and Question Generalization</title>

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is widely used in both evaluating free-text model responses and reward modeling for model alignment and finetuning. Recently, finetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred choice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former achieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to common biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical concerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this paper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of these judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges finetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by future models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well judges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three aspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and test distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three different base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging for most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with DPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that continual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older and newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker responses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance degradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones, showing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions. These findings provide insights into practical considerations for developing and deploying judge models in the face of ever-changing generators.

Abstract: Many modern applications involve predicting structured, non-Euclidean outputs such as probability distributions, networks, and symmetric positive-definite matrices. These outputs are naturally modeled as elements of general metric spaces, where classical regression techniques that rely on vector space structure no longer apply. We introduce E2M (End-to-End Metric regression), a deep learning framework for predicting metric space-valued outputs. E2M performs prediction via a weighted Fr\'echet means over training outputs, where the weights are learned by a neural network conditioned on the input. This construction provides a principled mechanism for geometry-aware prediction that avoids surrogate embeddings and restrictive parametric assumptions, while fully preserving the intrinsic geometry of the output space. We establish theoretical guarantees, including a universal approximation theorem that characterizes the expressive capacity of the model and a convergence analysis of the entropy-regularized training objective. Through extensive simulations involving probability distributions, networks, and symmetric positive-definite matrices, we show that E2M consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with its advantages becoming more pronounced at larger sample sizes. Applications to human mortality distributions and New York City taxi networks further demonstrate the flexibility and practical utility of the framework.

Abstract: Multimodal data are prevalent across various domains, and learning robust representations of such data is paramount to enhancing generation quality and downstream task performance. To handle heterogeneity and interconnections among different modalities, recent multimodal generative models extract shared and private (modality-specific) information with two separate variables. Despite attempts to enforce disentanglement between these two variables, these methods struggle with challenging datasets where the likelihood model is insufficient. In this paper, we propose Information-disentangled Multimodal VAE (IDMVAE) to explicitly address this issue, with rigorous mutual information-based regularizations, including cross-view mutual information maximization for extracting shared variables, and a cycle-consistency style loss for redundancy removal using generative augmentations. We further introduce diffusion models to improve the capacity of latent priors. These newly proposed components are complementary to each other. Compared to existing approaches, IDMVAE shows a clean separation between shared and private information, demonstrating superior generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging datasets.

Abstract: Medical dictation systems are essential tools in modern healthcare, enabling accurate and efficient conversion of speech into written medical documentation. The main objective of this paper is to create a domain-specific system for Greek medical speech transcriptions. The ultimate goal is to assist healthcare professionals by reducing the overload of manual documentation and improving workflow efficiency. Towards this goal, we develop a system that combines automatic speech recognition techniques with text correction model, allowing better handling of domain-specific terminology and linguistic variations in Greek. Our approach leverages both acoustic and textual modeling to create more realistic and reliable transcriptions. We focused on adapting existing language and speech technologies to the Greek medical context, addressing challenges such as complex medical terminology and linguistic inconsistencies. Through domain-specific fine-tuning, our system achieves more accurate and coherent transcriptions, contributing to the development of practical language technologies for the Greek healthcare sector.

<title>Fusing Sequence Motifs and Pan-Genomic Features: Antimicrobial Resistance Prediction using an Explainable Lightweight 1D CNN-XGBoost Ensemble</title>

Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis. While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes, current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data. This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of 809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.

Abstract: We present the first federated learning (FL) approach for pancreas part(head, body and tail) segmentation in MRI, addressing a critical clinical challenge as a significant innovation. Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches. We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing, leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture contrasts in MRI. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed, heterogeneous datasets.

Abstract: Aerial outdoor semantic navigation requires robots to explore large, unstructured environments to locate target objects. Recent advances in semantic navigation have demonstrated open-set object-goal navigation in indoor settings, but these methods remain limited by constrained spatial ranges and structured layouts, making them unsuitable for long-range outdoor search. While outdoor semantic navigation approaches exist, they either rely on reactive policies based on current observations, which tend to produce short-sighted behaviors, or precompute scene graphs offline for navigation, limiting adaptability to online deployment. We present RAVEN, a 3D memory-based, behavior tree framework for aerial semantic navigation in unstructured outdoor environments. It (1) uses a spatially consistent semantic voxel-ray map as persistent memory, enabling long-horizon planning and avoiding purely reactive behaviors, (2) combines short-range voxel search and long-range ray search to scale to large environments, (3) leverages a large vision-language model to suggest auxiliary cues, mitigating sparsity of outdoor targets. These components are coordinated by a behavior tree, which adaptively switches behaviors for robust operation. We evaluate RAVEN in 10 photorealistic outdoor simulation environments over 100 semantic tasks, encompassing single-object search, multi-class, multi-instance navigation and sequential task changes. Results show RAVEN outperforms baselines by 85.25% in simulation and demonstrate its real-world applicability through deployment on an aerial robot in outdoor field tests.

<title>Node Classification via Simplicial Interaction with Augmented Maximal Clique Selection</title>

Abstract: Considering higher-order interactions allows for a more comprehensive understanding of network structures beyond simple pairwise connections. While leveraging all cliques in a network to handle higher-order interactions is intuitive, it often leads to computational inefficiencies due to overlapping information between higher-order and lower-order cliques. To address this issue, we propose an augmented maximal clique strategy. Although using only maximal cliques can reduce unnecessary overlap and provide a concise representation of the network, certain nodes may still appear in multiple maximal cliques, resulting in imbalanced training data. Therefore, our augmented maximal clique approach selectively includes some non-maximal cliques to mitigate the overrepresentation of specific nodes and promote more balanced learning across the network. Comparative analyses on synthetic networks and real-world citation datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms approaches based on pairwise interactions, all cliques, or only maximal cliques. Finally, by integrating this strategy into GNN-based semi-supervised learning, we establish a link between maximal clique-based methods and GNNs, showing that incorporating higher-order structures improves predictive accuracy. As a result, the augmented maximal clique strategy offers a computationally efficient and effective solution for higher-order network learning.

<title>Benchmarking LLM-Assisted Blue Teaming via Standardized Threat Hunting</title>

Abstract: As cyber threats continue to grow in scale and sophistication, blue team defenders increasingly require advanced tools to proactively detect and mitigate risks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for enhancing threat analysis. However, their effectiveness in real-world blue team threat-hunting scenarios remains insufficiently explored. This paper presents CyberTeam, a benchmark designed to guide LLMs in blue teaming practice. CyberTeam constructs a standardized workflow in two stages. First, it models realistic threat-hunting workflows by capturing the dependencies among analytical tasks from threat attribution to incident response. Next, each task is addressed through a set of operational modules tailored to its specific analytical requirements. This transforms threat hunting into a structured sequence of reasoning steps, with each step grounded in a discrete operation and ordered according to task-specific dependencies. Guided by this framework, LLMs are directed to perform threat-hunting tasks through modularized steps. Overall, CyberTeam integrates 30 tasks and 9 operational modules to guide LLMs through standardized threat analysis. We evaluate both leading LLMs and state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents, comparing CyberTeam against open-ended reasoning strategies. Our results highlight the improvements enabled by standardized design, while also revealing the limitations of open-ended reasoning in real-world threat hunting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are intensively used to assist security analysts in counteracting the rapid exploitation of cyber threats, wherein LLMs offer cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to support vulnerability assessment and incident response. While recent work has shown that LLMs can support a wide range of CTI tasks such as threat analysis, vulnerability detection, and intrusion defense, significant performance gaps persist in practical deployments. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic vulnerabilities of LLMs in CTI, focusing on challenges that arise from the nature of the threat landscape itself rather than the model architecture. Using large-scale evaluations across multiple CTI benchmarks and real-world threat reports, we introduce a novel categorization methodology that integrates stratification, autoregressive refinement, and human-in-the-loop supervision to reliably analyze failure instances. Through extensive experiments and human inspections, we reveal three fundamental vulnerabilities: spurious correlations, contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization, that limit LLMs in effectively supporting CTI. Subsequently, we provide actionable insights for designing more robust LLM-powered CTI systems to facilitate future research.

<title>Towards Efficient CoT Distillation: Self-Guided Rationale Selector for Better Performance with Fewer Rationales</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation aims to enhance small language models' (SLMs) reasoning by transferring multi-step reasoning capability from the larger teacher models. However, existing work underestimates rationale quality, focusing primarily on data quantity, which may transfer noisy or incorrect information to the student model. To address the above issues, we proposed \textbf{M}odel-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}ationale \textbf{S}election \textbf{D}istillation (MoRSD), which can discern and select high quality rationales for distillation to improve performance further. We further propose a Rationale Difficulty (RD) metric to measure the ability of the student model to generate the correct answer under a given rationale. Compared to the baseline, we achieved 4.6$\%$ average improvement on seven datasets over three tasks, using fewer rationales by controlling their accuracy, diversity, and difficulty. Our results reveal that a small portion of the high quality rationales can enhance the reasoning ability of student models than the entire dataset. Our method promises to be a possible solution for efficient CoT distillation. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MoRSD.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) assets, such as models, datasets, and metadata, are central to modern ML workflows. Despite their explosive growth in practice, these assets are often underutilized due to fragmented documentation, siloed storage, inconsistent licensing, and lack of unified discovery mechanisms, making ML-asset management an urgent challenge. This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of ML-asset management activities across its lifecycle, including curation, discovery, and utilization. We provide a categorization of ML assets, and major management issues, survey state-of-the-art techniques, and identify emerging opportunities at each stage. We further highlight system-level challenges related to scalability, lineage, and unified indexing. Through live demonstrations of systems, this tutorial equips both researchers and practitioners with actionable insights and practical tools for advancing ML-asset management in real-world and domain-specific settings.

<title>Improving the Efficiency of LLM Agent Systems through Trajectory Reduction</title>

Abstract: Multi-turn agent systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly popular for software engineering tasks. While LLM agents show decent effectiveness, the high computational cost of input tokens due to the ever-growing trajectory remains an efficiency concern for their applications. Efficiency is largely neglected in existing studies and agent products, and this paper fills the gap by introducing an inference-time trajectory reduction approach to reduce the cost of agents.
  Through analyzing existing agent trajectories, we demonstrate that useless, redundant, and expired information is widespread in all trajectories, which can be identified and reduced without harming the agent's performance. We then design a simple yet effective trajectory reduction approach, AgentDiet, which automatically removes such waste information. We implement AgentDiet on a top-performing coding agent, and the evaluation on two LLMs and two benchmarks shows that AgentDiet can reduce input tokens by 39.9% ~ 59.7%, or the final computational cost by 21.1% ~ 35.9%, while maintaining the same agent performance. This indicates that trajectory reduction is a promising direction for agent systems.

<title>Toward a Holistic Approach to Continual Model Merging</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular, conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information. Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.

<title>Timber: Training-free Instruct Model Refining with Base via Effective Rank</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-training, which elicits a pretrained Base model into the corresponding Instruct model, is widely considered to be superficial. In this work, we first reinforce this hypothesis by providing novel quantitative evidence from the weight level that the effective rank (eRank) remains negligibly changed. However, this superficiality also suffers a critical trade-off, improving the exploitation capabilities at the cost of limiting its exploration. To tackle this issue, we propose Timber, a simple yet effective training-free method that enhances the exploration capability of the Instruct model while preserving its exploitation. The key insight is to partially revert Instruct towards the paired Base model by subtle yet targeted refinement of the weight deltas. Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen series demonstrate that Timber consistently improves vanilla Instruct models, particularly on Pass@k performance. Our findings offer new insights into the post-training stage at the weight level and practical strategies to refine the Instruct model without training.

Abstract: Simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods are the research hotspot currently, devoted to solving the problem of limited samples. Existing works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains, yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust, interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.

Abstract: We propose a novel task of text-controlled human object interaction generation in 3D scenes with movable objects. Existing human-scene interaction datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly. To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1) scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution. We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object. Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in generating physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the disproportionate distribution of samples across different classes within a dataset, where the minority classes are significantly underrepresented. This issue is also prevalent in graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms various baselines across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/flzeng1/GraphIFE.

Abstract: Structural changes in retinal blood vessels are critical biomarkers for the onset and progression of glaucoma and other ocular diseases. However, current vessel segmentation approaches largely rely on supervised learning and extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography. Here we present BioVessel-Net, an unsupervised generative framework that integrates vessel biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation strategy. Unlike pixel-based methods, BioVessel-Net directly models vascular structures with biostatistical coherence, achieving accurate and explainable vessel extraction without labeled data or high-performance computing. To support training and evaluation, we introduce RetinaMix, a new benchmark dataset of 2D and 3D OCTA images with high-resolution vessel details from diverse populations. Experimental results demonstrate that BioVessel-Net achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised methods. Together, BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution for retinal vessel analysis, with broad potential for glaucoma monitoring, blood flow modeling, and progression prediction. Code and dataset are available: https://github.com/VikiXie/SatMar8.

Abstract: Neural speech synthesis techniques have enabled highly realistic speech deepfakes, posing major security risks. Speech deepfake detection is challenging due to distribution shifts across spoofing methods and variability in speakers, channels, and recording conditions. We explore learning shared discriminative features as a path to robust detection and propose Information Bottleneck enhanced Confidence-Aware Adversarial Network (IB-CAAN). Confidence-guided adversarial alignment adaptively suppresses attack-specific artifacts without erasing discriminative cues, while the information bottleneck removes nuisance variability to preserve transferable features. Experiments on ASVspoof 2019/2021, ASVspoof 5, and In-the-Wild demonstrate that IB-CAAN consistently outperforms baseline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on many benchmarks.

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training, where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and remask them. This alternating ($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$) process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

<title>LightFair: Towards an Efficient Alternative for Fair T2I Diffusion via Debiasing Pre-trained Text Encoders</title>

Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder intervenes.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT. A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification. Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&amp;R) reward mechanism that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a pivotal approach to learning robotic manipulation at scale by repurposing large pre-trained Vision-Language-Models (VLM) to output robotic actions. However, adapting VLMs for robotic domains comes with an unnecessarily high computational cost, which we attribute to the tokenization scheme of visual inputs. In this work, we aim to enable efficient VLA training by proposing Oat-VLA, an Object-Agent-centric Tokenization for VLAs. Building on the insights of object-centric representation learning, our method introduces an inductive bias towards scene objects and the agent's own visual information. As a result, we find that Oat-VLA can drastically reduce the number of visual tokens to just a few tokens without sacrificing performance. We reveal that Oat-VLA converges at least twice as fast as OpenVLA on the LIBERO suite, as well as outperform OpenVLA in diverse real-world pick and place tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain unreliable for global enterprise applications due to substantial performance gaps between high-resource and mid/low-resource languages, driven by English-centric pretraining and internal reasoning biases. This inconsistency undermines customer experience and operational reliability in multilingual settings such as customer support, content moderation, and information retrieval. Even with advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, we observe up to an 29% accuracy drop in non-English languages compared to English.
  We propose a practical, batch-wise alignment strategy for fine-tuning LLMs, leveraging semantically equivalent multilingual data in each training batch to directly align model outputs across languages. This approach improves non-English accuracy by up to 23.9\% without compromising English performance, model reasoning, or retrieval quality. Our method is simple to implement, scalable, and integrates seamlessly with existing LLM training \& deployment pipelines, enabling more robust and equitable multilingual AI solutions in industry.

Abstract: The problem of class imbalance refers to an uneven distribution of quantity among classes in a dataset, where some classes are significantly underrepresented compared to others. Class imbalance is also prevalent in graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones. Data and code are available at https://github.com/flzeng1/PNS.

Abstract: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds, and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification.

<title>Beyond Greedy Exits: Improved Early Exit Decisions for Risk Control and Reliability</title>

Abstract: Early-Exit Deep Neural Networks enable adaptive inference by allowing prediction at intermediary layers, significantly reducing computational costs and latency. Most of the early exit strategies greedily exit a sample at an intermediary layer if the confidence in class prediction exceeds a predefined threshold that is set using a static validation set. This is problematic as the model might be overconfident in a wrong class. Also, they are not robust to distribution shifts encountered in deployment, which can undermine model trustworthiness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose UAT that adapts the threshold for exit decisions using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework, enabling online, unsupervised adjustment of exit decisions. UAT makes decisions based on a new reward function that assesses predictive certainty and its reliability to balance computational efficiency and prediction quality while penalizing unnecessary late exits. We provide guarantees on risk achieved by UAT and validate its performance on diverse tasks spanning vision-language understanding, text generation, and classification. Our framework demonstrates consistent improvements in speedup (1.70-2.10x) with a minimal performance drop (<2%) as compared to full model performance. Our source code is available at https://github.com/Div290/UAT.

Abstract: Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN). DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore, a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on vision-language benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether these benchmarks assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues. Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction, hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases, indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers & practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases, enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

<title>Towards a Comprehensive Scaling Law of Mixture-of-Experts</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size ($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)). Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model design and training.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerges as a key enabler for next-generation applications such as smart cities and autonomous systems. Its integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) unlocks new potentials for reliable communication and precise sensing in dynamic aerial environments. However, existing research predominantly treats UAVs as aerial base stations, overlooking their role as ISAC users, and fails to leverage large-scale antenna arrays at terrestrial base stations to enhance security and spectral efficiency. This paper propose a secure and spectral efficient ISAC framework for multi-UAV networks, and a two-stage optimization approach is developed to jointly design hybrid beamforming (HBF), artificial noise (AN) injection, and UAV trajectories. Aiming at maximizing the sum secrecy rate, the first stage employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize digital beamformers and trajectories, and the second stage decomposes the digital solution into analog and digital components via low-complexity matrix factorization. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to benchmark schemes.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) offer strong zero-shot forecasting via large-scale pre-training, yet fine-tuning remains critical for boosting performance in domains with limited public data. With the growing number of TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target) dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers, capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3 forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets, achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.

Abstract: Recent works on object removal and insertion have enhanced their performance by handling object effects such as shadows and reflections, using diffusion models trained on counterfactual datasets. However, the performance impact of applying classifier-free guidance to handle object effects across removal and insertion tasks within a unified model remains largely unexplored. To address this gap and improve efficiency in composite editing, we propose CrimEdit, which jointly trains the task embeddings for removal and insertion within a single model and leverages them in a classifier-free guidance scheme -- enhancing the removal of both objects and their effects, and enabling controllable synthesis of object effects during insertion. CrimEdit also extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions, enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and insertion stages.

<title>Bridging Discrete and Continuous RL: Stable Deterministic Policy Gradient with Martingale Characterization</title>

Abstract: The theory of discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced rapidly over the past decades. Although primarily designed for discrete environments, many real-world RL applications are inherently continuous and complex. A major challenge in extending discrete-time algorithms to continuous-time settings is their sensitivity to time discretization, often leading to poor stability and slow convergence. In this paper, we investigate deterministic policy gradient methods for continuous-time RL. We derive a continuous-time policy gradient formula based on an analogue of the advantage function and establish its martingale characterization. This theoretical foundation leads to our proposed algorithm, CT-DDPG, which enables stable learning with deterministic policies in continuous-time environments. Numerical experiments show that the proposed CT-DDPG algorithm offers improved stability and faster convergence compared to existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods, across a wide range of control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.

Abstract: Pipeline parallelism is widely used to train large language models (LLMs). However, increasing heterogeneity in model architectures exacerbates pipeline bubbles, thereby reducing training efficiency. Existing approaches overlook the co-optimization of model partition, model placement, and workload scheduling, resulting in limited efficiency improvement or even performance degradation. To respond, we propose AdaPtis, an LLM training system that supports adaptive pipeline parallelism. First, we develop a pipeline performance model to accurately estimate training throughput. Second, AdaPtis jointly optimizes model partition, model placement, and workload scheduling policies guided by this performance model. Third, we design a unified pipeline executor that efficiently supports the execution of diverse pipeline strategies. Extensive experiments show that AdaPtis achieves an average speedup of 1.42x (up to 2.14x) over Megatron-LM I-1F1B across various LLM architectures and scales.

Abstract: Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long) dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Guidance methods have demonstrated significant improvements in cross-modal audio generation, including text-to-audio (T2A) and video-to-audio (V2A) generation. The popularly adopted method, classifier-free guidance (CFG), steers generation by emphasizing condition alignment, enhancing fidelity but often at the cost of diversity. Recently, autoguidance (AG) has been explored for audio generation, encouraging the sampling to faithfully reconstruct the target distribution and showing increased diversity. Despite these advances, they usually rely on a single guiding principle, e.g., condition alignment in CFG or score accuracy in AG, leaving the full potential of guidance for audio generation untapped. In this work, we explore enriching the composition of the guidance method and present a mixture-of-guidance framework, AudioMoG. Within the design space, AudioMoG can exploit the complementary advantages of distinctive guiding principles by fulfilling their cumulative benefits. With a reduced form, AudioMoG can consider parallel complements or recover a single guiding principle, without sacrificing generality. We experimentally show that, given the same inference speed, AudioMoG approach consistently outperforms single guidance in T2A generation across sampling steps, concurrently showing advantages in V2A, text-to-music, and image generation. These results highlight a "free lunch" in current cross-modal audio generation systems: higher quality can be achieved through mixed guiding principles at the sampling stage without sacrificing inference efficiency.

Abstract: In text-driven 3D scene generation, object layout serves as a crucial intermediate representation that bridges high-level language instructions with detailed geometric output. It not only provides a structural blueprint for ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation. M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed scenes. We hope that M3DLayout can serve as a valuable resource for advancing research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

<title>HieraTok: Multi-Scale Visual Tokenizer Improves Image Reconstruction and Generation</title>

Abstract: In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer (ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1) multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details. Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a 27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space. Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise enhanced reasoning by integrating diverse inputs such as text, vision, and audio. Yet cross-modal reasoning remains underexplored, with conflicting reports on whether added modalities help or harm performance. These inconsistencies stem from a lack of controlled evaluation frameworks and analysis of models' internals to isolate when and why modality interactions support or undermine reasoning. We address this gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes multimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are distributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional modalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient reasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts performance. Moreover, reasoning degrades in three systematic ways: weaker modalities drag down overall performance, conflicts bias preference toward certain modalities, and joint signals from different modalities fail to be integrated effectively. Therefore, we identify two core failures: task-composition bottleneck, where recognition and reasoning cannot be jointly executed in one pass, and fusion bottleneck, where early integration introduces bias. For further investigation, we find that attention patterns fail to encode fact usefulness, but a simple two-step prompting (recognize then reason) restores performance, confirming the task-composition bottleneck. Moreover, modality identity remains recoverable in early layers, and softening attention in early fusion improves reasoning, highlighting biased fusion as another failure mode. Overall, our findings show that integration, not perception, is the main barrier to multimodal reasoning, suggesting composition-aware training and early fusion control as promising directions.

Abstract: Modern locomotion controllers are manually tuned for specific embodiments. We present LocoFormer, a generalist omni-bodied locomotion model that can control previously unseen legged and wheeled robots, even without precise knowledge of their kinematics. LocoFormer is able to adapt to changes in morphology and dynamics at test time. We find that two key choices enable adaptation. First, we train massive scale RL on procedurally generated robots with aggressive domain randomization. Second, in contrast to previous policies that are myopic with short context lengths, we extend context by orders of magnitude to span episode boundaries. We deploy the same LocoFormer to varied robots and show robust control even with large disturbances such as weight change and motor failures. In extreme scenarios, we see emergent adaptation across episodes, LocoFormer learns from falls in early episodes to improve control strategies in later ones. We believe that this simple, yet general recipe can be used to train foundation models for other robotic skills in the future. Videos at generalist-locomotion.github.io.

<title>Poivre: Self-Refining Visual Pointing with Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre). This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training, we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%. To support future research, we release our training and inference code, dataset, and the Poivre-7B checkpoint.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common and deadly cancers, emphasizing the need for effective early detection and treatment. To address the limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks, and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction, dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851 and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's capability for real-time, accurate performance within familiar distributions. The source code of our network is available at https://github.com/ayousefinejad/PVTAdpNet.git

<title>Understanding Textual Capability Degradation in Speech LLMs via Parameter Importance Analysis</title>

Abstract: The integration of speech into Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially expanded their capabilities, but often at the cost of weakening their core textual competence. This degradation limits the ability of speech-enabled LLMs to fully exploit their pre-trained text-based knowledge. In this work, we analyze the underlying mechanisms of this issue through a focused study of the widely used encoder-adaptor paradigm. We propose an analytical framework based on parameter importance estimation, which reveals that fine-tuning for speech introduces a textual importance distribution shift: the layer-wise allocation of parameters critical to textual reasoning is disrupted. Building on this insight, we investigate two mitigation strategies: layer-wise learning rate scheduling and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), both aim to preserve the original parameter distribution. Experimental results show that both approaches better maintain textual competence than full fine-tuning, while also improving downstream spoken question answering performance. Furthermore, our analysis offers a principled explanation for the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies, linking their benefits to the structural properties of textual knowledge in LLMs.

Abstract: Interpretable risk scores play a vital role in clinical decision support, yet traditional methods for deriving such scores often rely on manual preprocessing, task-specific modeling, and simplified assumptions that limit their flexibility and predictive power. We present SHAPoint, a novel, task-agnostic framework that integrates the predictive accuracy of gradient boosted trees with the interpretability of point-based risk scores. SHAPoint supports classification, regression, and survival tasks, while also inheriting valuable properties from tree-based models, such as native handling of missing data and support for monotonic constraints. Compared to existing frameworks, SHAPoint offers superior flexibility, reduced reliance on manual preprocessing, and faster runtime performance. Empirical results show that SHAPoint produces compact and interpretable scores with predictive performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, but at a fraction of the runtime, making it a powerful tool for transparent and scalable risk stratification.

<title>Accuracy-Robustness Trade Off via Spiking Neural Network Gradient Sparsity Trail</title>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted growing interest in both computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, primarily due to their inherent energy efficiency and compact memory footprint. However, achieving adversarial robustness in SNNs, particularly for vision-related tasks, remains a nascent and underexplored challenge. Recent studies have proposed leveraging sparse gradients as a form of regularization to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. In this work, we present a surprising finding: under specific architectural configurations, SNNs exhibit natural gradient sparsity and can achieve state-of-the-art adversarial defense performance without the need for any explicit regularization. Further analysis reveals a trade-off between robustness and generalization: while sparse gradients contribute to improved adversarial resilience, they can impair the model's ability to generalize; conversely, denser gradients support better generalization but increase vulnerability to attacks.

<title>Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning: Dual-Fact Alignment for Long-Form Factuality</title>

Abstract: Hallucination and factuality deficits remain key obstacles to the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in long-form generation. Existing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks primarily rely on preference rewards, yet they often overlook the model's internal knowledge boundaries, exacerbating the so-called "hallucination tax". To address this challenge, we propose Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF), a novel framework that focuses on the knowledge consistency between the policy model's expressed knowledge and the base model's parametric knowledge, and introduces a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism to jointly optimize factual recall and precision. Specifically, KLCF leverages pretrained knowledge boundaries to construct fact checklist, guiding online reinforcement learning to improve factual coverage and recall; simultaneously, it trains a self-assessment module based on the base model's internal knowledge to enhance factual precision during generation. Unlike prior methods that rely on external retrieval or heavy verification, our reward design is fully external-knowledge-free and lightweight, making KLCF efficient and easily scalable to large-scale training. Experimental results demonstrate that KLCF substantially improves factuality metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model hallucinations.

<title>From Personal to Collective: On the Role of Local and Global Memory in LLM Personalization</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to tailor model behavior to individual users based on their historical interactions. However, its effectiveness is often hindered by two key challenges: the \textit{cold-start problem}, where users with limited history provide insufficient context for accurate personalization, and the \textit{biasing problem}, where users with abundant but skewed history cause the model to overfit to narrow preferences. We identify both issues as symptoms of a common underlying limitation, i.e., the inability to model collective knowledge across users. To address this, we propose a local-global memory framework (LoGo) that combines the personalized local memory with a collective global memory that captures shared interests across the population. To reconcile discrepancies between these two memory sources, we introduce a mediator module designed to resolve conflicts between local and global signals. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoGo consistently improves personalization quality by both warming up cold-start users and mitigating biased predictions. These results highlight the importance of incorporating collective knowledge to enhance LLM personalization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.

<title>Sequence Pathfinder for Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery in the Warehouse</title>

Abstract: Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) is a challenging extension of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), where agents are required to sequentially complete tasks with fixed-location pickup and delivery demands. Although learning-based methods have made progress in MAPD, they often perform poorly in warehouse-like environments with narrow pathways and long corridors when relying only on local observations for distributed decision-making. Communication learning can alleviate the lack of global information but introduce high computational complexity due to point-to-point communication. To address this challenge, we formulate MAPF as a sequence modeling problem and prove that path-finding policies under sequence modeling possess order-invariant optimality, ensuring its effectiveness in MAPD. Building on this, we propose the Sequential Pathfinder (SePar), which leverages the Transformer paradigm to achieve implicit information exchange, reducing decision-making complexity from exponential to linear while maintaining efficiency and global awareness. Experiments demonstrate that SePar consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods across various MAPF tasks and their variants, and generalizes well to unseen environments. Furthermore, we highlight the necessity of integrating imitation learning in complex maps like warehouses.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs) excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\% of the network's parameters.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques enable automatic creation of diverse and complex environments. While PCG facilitates more efficient content creation, ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content remains a significant challenge. In this research, we propose a method to identify and repair unstable levels generated by existing PCG models. We use Angry Birds as a case study, demonstrating our method on game levels produced by established PCG approaches. Our method leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs. We evaluate multiple object segmentation models and select the most effective one as the basis for our repair pipeline. Experimental results show that our method improves the stability and playability of AI-generated levels. Although our evaluation is specific to Angry Birds, our image-based approach is designed to be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures.

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a promising approach in controlling large language models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. However, most existing steering methods rely on large-scale datasets to learn clear behavioral information, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The steering vectors extracted from small dataset often contain task-irrelevant noising features, which degrades their effectiveness. To refine the steering vectors learned from limited data, we introduce Refinement of Steering Vector via Sparse Autoencoder (SAE-RSV) that leverages SAEs to semantically denoise and augment the steering vectors. In our framework, we first remove task-irrelevant features according to their semantics provided by SAEs, and then enrich task-relevant features missing from the small dataset through their semantic similarity to the identified relevant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all the baseline methods including supervised fine-tuning. Our findings show that effective steering vector can be constructed from limited training data by refining the original steering vector through SAEs.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals), (b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6 modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy, Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium, and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3 can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for even the strongest models.

<title>Tequila: Trapping-free Ternary Quantization for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization. To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct, meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained environments. The code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

Abstract: Unit testing is essential for software quality assurance, yet writing and maintaining tests remains time-consuming and error-prone. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed various techniques for automating unit test generation, including traditional heuristic-based methods and more recent approaches that leverage large language models (LLMs). However, these existing approaches are inherently path-insensitive because they rely on fixed heuristics or limited contextual information and fail to reason about deep control-flow structures. As a result, they often struggle to achieve adequate coverage, particularly for deep or complex execution paths. In this work, we present a path-sensitive framework, JUnitGenie, to fill this gap by combining code knowledge with the semantic capabilities of LLMs in guiding context-aware unit test generation. After extracting code knowledge from Java projects, JUnitGenie distills this knowledge into structured prompts to guide the generation of high-coverage unit tests. We evaluate JUnitGenie on 2,258 complex focal methods from ten real-world Java projects. The results show that JUnitGenie generates valid tests and improves branch and line coverage by 29.60% and 31.00% on average over both heuristic and LLM-based baselines. We further demonstrate that the generated test cases can uncover real-world bugs, which were later confirmed and fixed by developers.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE). Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF research.

Abstract: Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to facilitate further research in this domain.

Abstract: Inorganic crystals are periodic, highly-symmetric arrangements of atoms in three-dimensional space. Their structures are constrained by the symmetry operations of a crystallographic \emph{space group} and restricted to lie in specific affine subspaces known as \emph{Wyckoff positions}. The frequency an atom appears in the crystal and its rough positioning are determined by its Wyckoff position. Most generative models that predict atomic coordinates overlook these symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistically high populations of proposed crystals exhibiting limited symmetry. We introduce Space Group Conditional Flow Matching, a novel generative framework that samples significantly closer to the target population of highly-symmetric, stable crystals. We achieve this by conditioning the entire generation process on a given space group and set of Wyckoff positions; specifically, we define a conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned, equivariant, parametric vector field that restricts the motion of atoms to their initial Wyckoff position. Our form of group-conditioned equivariance is achieved using an efficient reformulation of \emph{group averaging} tailored for symmetric crystals. Importantly, it reduces the computational overhead of symmetrization to a negligible level. We achieve state of the art results on crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks. We also perform relevant ablations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation, but they face critical security risks when applied to practical production due to package hallucinations, in which LLMs recommend non-existent packages. These hallucinations can be exploited in software supply chain attacks, where malicious attackers exploit them to register harmful packages. It is critical to test LLMs for package hallucinations to mitigate package hallucinations and defend against potential attacks. Although researchers have proposed testing frameworks for fact-conflicting hallucinations in natural language generation, there is a lack of research on package hallucinations. To fill this gap, we propose HFUZZER, a novel phrase-based fuzzing framework to test LLMs for package hallucinations. HFUZZER adopts fuzzing technology and guides the model to infer a wider range of reasonable information based on phrases, thereby generating enough and diverse coding tasks. Furthermore, HFUZZER extracts phrases from package information or coding tasks to ensure the relevance of phrases and code, thereby improving the relevance of generated tasks and code. We evaluate HFUZZER on multiple LLMs and find that it triggers package hallucinations across all selected models. Compared to the mutational fuzzing framework, HFUZZER identifies 2.60x more unique hallucinated packages and generates more diverse tasks. Additionally, when testing the model GPT-4o, HFUZZER finds 46 unique hallucinated packages. Further analysis reveals that for GPT-4o, LLMs exhibit package hallucinations not only during code generation but also when assisting with environment configuration.

Abstract: Robustness to modeling errors and uncertainties remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging diffusion models to train robust RL policies. Diffusion models have recently gained popularity in model-based RL due to their ability to generate full trajectories "all at once", mitigating the compounding errors typical of step-by-step transition models. Moreover, they can be conditioned to sample from specific distributions, making them highly flexible. We leverage conditional sampling to learn policies that are robust to uncertainty in environment dynamics. Building on the established connection between Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization and robust RL, we introduce Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL). AD-RRL guides the diffusion process to generate worst-case trajectories during training, effectively optimizing the CVaR of the cumulative return. Empirical results across standard benchmarks show that AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and performance compared to existing robust RL methods.

Abstract: Structured representation of product information is a major bottleneck for the efficiency of e-commerce platforms, especially in second-hand ecommerce platforms. Currently, most product information are organized based on manually curated product categories and attributes, which often fail to adequately cover long-tail products and do not align well with buyer preference. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{S}emantic \textbf{I}n\textbf{D}exings (GSID), a data-driven approach to generate product structured representations. GSID consists of two key components: (1) Pre-training on unstructured product metadata to learn in-domain semantic embeddings, and (2) Generating more effective semantic codes tailored for downstream product-centric applications. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of GSID, and it has been successfully deployed on the real-world e-commerce platform, achieving promising results on product understanding and other downstream tasks.

<title>Efficient Multi-turn RL for GUI Agents via Decoupled Training and Adaptive Data Curation</title>

arXiv:2509.23866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner. DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput, and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1) pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

<title>Taught Well Learned Ill: Towards Distillation-conditional Backdoor Attack</title>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a vital technique for deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained devices by transferring knowledge from large teacher models to lightweight student models. While teacher models from third-party platforms may undergo security verification (\eg, backdoor detection), we uncover a novel and critical threat: distillation-conditional backdoor attacks (DCBAs). DCBA injects dormant and undetectable backdoors into teacher models, which become activated in student models via the KD process, even with clean distillation datasets. While the direct extension of existing methods is ineffective for DCBA, we implement this attack by formulating it as a bilevel optimization problem and proposing a simple yet effective method (\ie, SCAR). Specifically, the inner optimization simulates the KD process by optimizing a surrogate student model, while the outer optimization leverages outputs from this surrogate to optimize the teacher model for implanting the conditional backdoor. Our SCAR addresses this complex optimization utilizing an implicit differentiation algorithm with a pre-optimized trigger injection function. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model architectures, and KD techniques validate the effectiveness of our SCAR and its resistance against existing backdoor detection, highlighting a significant yet previously overlooked vulnerability in the KD process. Our code is available at https://github.com/WhitolfChen/SCAR.

Abstract: Identifying attribute values from product profiles is a key task for improving product search, recommendation, and business analytics on e-commerce platforms, which we called Product Attribute Value Identification (PAVI) . However, existing PAVI methods face critical challenges, such as cascading errors, inability to handle out-of-distribution (OOD) attribute values, and lack of generalization capability. To address these limitations, we introduce Multi-Value-Product Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MVP-RAG), combining the strengths of retrieval, generation, and classification paradigms. MVP-RAG defines PAVI as a retrieval-generation task, where the product title description serves as the query, and products and attribute values act as the corpus. It first retrieves similar products of the same category and candidate attribute values, and then generates the standardized attribute values. The key advantages of this work are: (1) the proposal of a multi-level retrieval scheme, with products and attribute values as distinct hierarchical levels in PAVI domain (2) attribute value generation of large language model to significantly alleviate the OOD problem and (3) its successful deployment in a real-world industrial environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MVP-RAG performs better than the state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

Abstract: Expressive performance rendering (EPR) and automatic piano transcription (APT) are fundamental yet inverse tasks in music information retrieval: EPR generates expressive performances from symbolic scores, while APT recovers scores from performances. Despite their dual nature, prior work has addressed them independently. In this paper we propose a unified framework that jointly models EPR and APT by disentangling note-level score content and global performance style representations from both paired and unpaired data. Our framework is built on a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architecture and is trained using only sequence-aligned data, without requiring fine-grained note-level alignment. To automate the rendering process while ensuring stylistic compatibility with the score, we introduce an independent diffusion-based performance style recommendation module that generates style embeddings directly from score content. This modular component supports both style transfer and flexible rendering across a range of expressive styles. Experimental results from both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance on EPR and APT tasks, while enabling effective content-style disentanglement, reliable style transfer, and stylistically appropriate rendering. Demos are available at https://jointpianist.github.io/epr-apt/

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

<title>Tunable-Generalization Diffusion Powered by Self-Supervised Contextual Sub-Data for Low-Dose CT Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time, self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising, SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing. Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.

<title>Towards Understanding Subliminal Learning: When and How Hidden Biases Transfer</title>

Abstract: Language models can transfer hidden biases during distillation. For example, a teacher that "likes owls" can make its student "like owls" too, even when the training data consists only of lists of numbers. This surprising phenomenon is called subliminal learning. Subliminal learning can be expected under soft distillation, where the student is trained on the teacher's full next-token distribution. But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where the student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how does subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that subliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage. Instead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where teachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out these tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically, divergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly, finetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal learning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small changes, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it.

Abstract: A key challenge in modern deep learning theory is to explain the remarkable success of gradient-based optimization methods when training large-scale, complex deep neural networks. Though linear convergence of such methods has been proved for a handful of specific architectures, a united theory still evades researchers. This article presents a unified proof for linear convergence of continuous gradient descent, also called gradient flow, while training any neural network with piecewise non-zero polynomial activations or ReLU, sigmoid activations. Our primary contribution is a single, general theorem that not only covers architectures for which this result was previously unknown but also consolidates existing results under weaker assumptions. While our focus is theoretical and our results are only exact in the infinitesimal step size limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the predictions of our result and those of the practical step-size gradient descent method.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods, effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for continuous LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-world multimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data; Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models to address privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modal knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leading to reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning; to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning (CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visual unlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual representations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledge retention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semantic consistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the model performance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn set and retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement with only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

Abstract: End-to-end deep learning models fed with multi-band galaxy images are powerful data-driven tools used to estimate galaxy physical properties in the absence of spectroscopy. However, due to a lack of interpretability and the associational nature of such models, it is difficult to understand how the information additional to integrated photometry (e.g., morphology) contributes to the estimation task. Improving our understanding in this field would enable further advances into unraveling the physical connections among galaxy properties and optimizing data exploitation. Therefore, our work is aimed at interpreting the deep learning-based estimation of stellar mass via two interpretability techniques: causal analysis and mutual information decomposition. The former reveals the causal paths between multiple variables beyond nondirectional statistical associations, while the latter quantifies the multicomponent contributions (i.e., redundant, unique, and synergistic) of different input data to the stellar mass estimation. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we obtained meaningful results that provide physical interpretations for image-based models. Our work demonstrates the gains from combining deep learning with interpretability techniques, and holds promise in promoting more data-driven astrophysical research (e.g., astrophysical parameter estimations and investigations on complex multivariate physical processes).

Abstract: Medical imaging foundation models must adapt over time, yet full retraining is often blocked by privacy constraints and cost. We present a continual learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at 0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and synaptic stability. The results indicate a practical route for scalable, privacy aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been successfully used to design forwarding strategies for multi-hop mobile wireless networks. While such strategies can be used directly for networks with varied connectivity and dynamic conditions, developing generalizable approaches that are effective on scenarios significantly different from the training environment remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a framework to address the challenge of generalizability by (i) developing a generalizable base model considering diverse mobile network scenarios, and (ii) using the generalizable base model for new scenarios, and when needed, fine-tuning the base model using a small amount of data from the new scenarios. To support this framework, we first design new features to characterize network variation and feature quality, thereby improving the information used in DRL-based forwarding decisions. We then develop a continual learning (CL) approach able to train DRL models across diverse network scenarios without ``catastrophic forgetting.'' Using extensive evaluation, including real-world scenarios in two cities, we show that our approach is generalizable to unseen mobility scenarios. Compared to a state-of-the-art heuristic forwarding strategy, it leads to up to 78% reduction in delay, 24% improvement in delivery rate, and comparable or slightly higher number of forwards.

Abstract: We introduce GMAN, a flexible, interpretable, and expressive framework that extends Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNANs) to learn from sets of sparse time-series data. GMAN represents each time-dependent trajectory as a directed graph and applies an enriched, more expressive GNAN to each graph. It allows users to control the interpretability-expressivity trade-off by grouping features and graphs to encode priors, and it provides feature, node, and graph-level interpretability. On real-world datasets, including mortality prediction from blood tests and fake-news detection, GMAN outperforms strong non-interpretable black-box baselines while delivering actionable, domain-aligned explanations.

<title>Taming Masked Diffusion Language Models via Consistency Trajectory Reinforcement Learning with Fewer Decoding Step</title>

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored. A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal (parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding, achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO) for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks, such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/yjyddq/EOSER-ASS-RL.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective approach for accelerating inference in Large Language models (LLMs), but its adaptation to Vision-Language models (VLMs) remains challenging for additional visual tokens in multimodal inputs. First, owing to the fact that the drafter and the target VLM may derived from different families, the semantic representations of visual tokens in the target VLM are misaligned with those in the drafter, introducing bias into the KV-cache during the prefill stage. Second, the large number of visual tokens substantially slows down the drafter's self-attention during the decoding stage. We propose Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative Decoding in Vision-Language Models (HiViS), an explicit-implicit input decomposition framework that alleviates the above inefficiency. All visual tokens are removed from the drafter's input, retaining only textual tokens as explicit inputs, while directly reusing the target VLM's corresponding last-layer hidden states as implicit visual information without additional processing. To train the drafter efficiently, we introduces multi-step self-feedback training strategy with dynamic data selection and sequential embedding supervision to simulate reasoning during training. Our approach compresses the prefill sequence length of the drafter to only 0.7%-1.3% of the target VLM's input, while maintaining lossless generation quality. Extensive experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate up to 2.65x speedup, confirming the effectiveness of HiViS in accelerating VLM inference.

Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum mechanics.

<title>Easy Turn: Integrating Acoustic and Linguistic Modalities for Robust Turn-Taking in Full-Duplex Spoken Dialogue Systems</title>

Abstract: Full-duplex interaction is crucial for natural human-machine communication, yet remains challenging as it requires robust turn-taking detection to decide when the system should speak, listen, or remain silent. Existing solutions either rely on dedicated turn-taking models, most of which are not open-sourced. The few available ones are limited by their large parameter size or by supporting only a single modality, such as acoustic or linguistic. Alternatively, some approaches finetune LLM backbones to enable full-duplex capability, but this requires large amounts of full-duplex data, which remain scarce in open-source form. To address these issues, we propose Easy Turn, an open-source, modular turn-taking detection model that integrates acoustic and linguistic bimodal information to predict four dialogue turn states: complete, incomplete, backchannel, and wait, accompanied by the release of Easy Turn trainset, a 1,145-hour speech dataset designed for training turn-taking detection models. Compared to existing open-source models like TEN Turn Detection and Smart Turn V2, our model achieves state-of-the-art turn-taking detection accuracy on our open-source Easy Turn testset. The data and model will be made publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency, limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches 58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods (e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are available at: https://github.com/yks23/Explore-Execute-Chain.git

<title>Vision-Grounded Machine Interpreting: Improving the Translation Process through Visual Cues</title>

Abstract: Machine Interpreting systems are currently implemented as unimodal, real-time speech-to-speech architectures, processing translation exclusively on the basis of the linguistic signal. Such reliance on a single modality, however, constrains performance in contexts where disambiguation and adequacy depend on additional cues, such as visual, situational, or pragmatic information. This paper introduces Vision-Grounded Interpreting (VGI), a novel approach designed to address the limitations of unimodal machine interpreting. We present a prototype system that integrates a vision-language model to process both speech and visual input from a webcam, with the aim of priming the translation process through contextual visual information. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we constructed a hand-crafted diagnostic corpus targeting three types of ambiguity. In our evaluation, visual grounding substantially improves lexical disambiguation, yields modest and less stable gains for gender resolution, and shows no benefit for syntactic ambiguities. We argue that embracing multimodality represents a necessary step forward for advancing translation quality in machine interpreting.

<title>MAD-PINN: A Decentralized Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Safe and Optimal Multi-Agent Control</title>

Abstract: Co-optimizing safety and performance in large-scale multi-agent systems remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), safety filtering, or Model Predictive Control (MPC) either lack strict safety guarantees, suffer from conservatism, or fail to scale effectively. We propose MAD-PINN, a decentralized physics-informed machine learning framework for solving the multi-agent state-constrained optimal control problem (MASC-OCP). Our method leverages an epigraph-based reformulation of SC-OCP to simultaneously capture performance and safety, and approximates its solution via a physics-informed neural network. Scalability is achieved by training the SC-OCP value function on reduced-agent systems and deploying them in a decentralized fashion, where each agent relies only on local observations of its neighbours for decision-making. To further enhance safety and efficiency, we introduce an Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based neighbour selection strategy to prioritize safety-critical interactions, and a receding-horizon policy execution scheme that adapts to dynamic interactions while reducing computational burden. Experiments on multi-agent navigation tasks demonstrate that MAD-PINN achieves superior safety-performance trade-offs, maintains scalability as the number of agents grows, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Preference alignment is a critical step in making Large Language Models (LLMs) useful and aligned with (human) preferences. Existing approaches such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Direct Preference Optimization typically require curated data and expensive optimization over billions of parameters, and eventually lead to persistent task-specific models. In this work, we introduce Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals encoded in the residual streams of LLMs. From as few as one hundred preference pairs, PaLRS extracts lightweight, plug-and-play steering vectors that can be applied at inference time to push models toward preferred behaviors. We evaluate PaLRS on various small-to-medium-scale open-source LLMs, showing that PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline general-purpose performance. Moreover, when compared to DPO-aligned models, they perform better with huge time savings. Our findings highlight that PaLRS offers an effective, much more efficient and flexible alternative to standard preference optimization pipelines, offering a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism for alignment with minimal data.

<title>The Hidden Costs of Translation Accuracy: Distillation, Quantization, and Environmental Impact</title>

Abstract: The rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns about their computational and environmental costs. This study investigates the trade-offs between translation quality and efficiency by comparing full-scale, distilled, and quantized models using machine translation as a case study. We evaluated performance on the Flores+ benchmark and through human judgments of conversational translations in French, Hindi, and Kannada. Our analysis of carbon emissions per evaluation run revealed that the full 3.3B fp32 model, while achieving the highest BLEU scores, incurred the largest environmental footprint (about 0.007-0.008 kg CO2 per run). The distilled models achieved an inference of up to 4.5x faster than the full 3.3B model, with only minimal reductions in BLEU scores. Human evaluations also showed that even aggressive quantization (INT4) preserved high levels of accuracy and fluency, with differences between models generally minor. These findings demonstrate that model compression strategies can substantially reduce computational demands and environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, though trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings. We argue for evaluation frameworks that integrate efficiency and sustainability alongside objective metrics as central dimensions of progress in NLP.

Abstract: Modern causal discovery methods face critical limitations in scalability, computational efficiency, and adaptability to mixed data types, as evidenced by benchmarks on node scalability (30, $\le 50$, $\ge 70$ nodes), computational energy demands, and continuous/non-continuous data handling. While traditional algorithms like PC, GES, and ICA-LiNGAM struggle with these challenges, exhibiting prohibitive energy costs for higher-order nodes and poor scalability beyond 70 nodes, we propose \textbf{GUIDE}, a framework that integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-generated adjacency matrices with observational data through a dual-encoder architecture. GUIDE uniquely optimizes computational efficiency, reducing runtime on average by $\approx 42%$ compared to RL-BIC and KCRL methods, while achieving an average $\approx 117%$ improvement in accuracy over both NOTEARS and GraN-DAG individually. During training, GUIDE's reinforcement learning agent dynamically balances reward maximization (accuracy) and penalty avoidance (DAG constraints), enabling robust performance across mixed data types and scalability to $\ge 70$ nodes -- a setting where baseline methods fail.

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in industry, it is essential to safeguard them. We introduce a novel framework that automates the translation of unstructured design documents into verifiable, real-time guardrails. We introduce "Policy as Prompt," a new approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and enforce natural language policies by applying contextual understanding and the principle of least privilege. Our system first ingests technical artifacts to construct a verifiable policy tree, which is then compiled into lightweight, prompt-based classifiers that audit agent behavior at runtime. We validate our approach across diverse applications, demonstrating a scalable and auditable pipeline that bridges the critical policy-to-practice gap, paving the way for verifiably safer and more regulatable AI.

Abstract: MCP standardizes how LLMs interact with external systems, forming the foundation for general agents. However, existing MCP benchmarks remain narrow in scope: they focus on read-heavy tasks or tasks with limited interaction depth, and fail to capture the complexity and realism of real-world workflows. To address this gap, we propose MCPMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate MCP use in a more realistic and comprehensive manner. It consists of $127$ high-quality tasks collaboratively created by domain experts and AI agents. Each task begins with a curated initial state and includes a programmatic script for automatic verification. These tasks demand richer and more diverse interactions with the environment, involving a broad range of create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of cutting-edge LLMs using a minimal agent framework that operates in a tool-calling loop. Empirical results show that the best-performing model, gpt-5-medium, reaches only $52.56$\% pass@1 and $33.86$\% pass^4, while other widely regarded strong models, including claude-sonnet-4 and o3, fall below $30$\% pass@1 and $15$\% pass^4. On average, LLMs require $16.2$ execution turns and $17.4$ tool calls per task, significantly surpassing those in previous MCP benchmarks and highlighting the stress-testing nature of MCPMark.

<title>SLA: Beyond Sparsity in Diffusion Transformers via Fine-Tunable Sparse-Linear Attention</title>

Abstract: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation, attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N) attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality, outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a 2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies, processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in flexible and efficient video understanding.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate three cross-facility data streaming architectures, Direct Streaming (DTS), Proxied Streaming (PRS), and Managed Service Streaming (MSS). We examine their architectural variations in data flow paths and deployment feasibility, and detail their implementation using the Data Streaming to HPC (DS2HPC) architectural framework and the SciStream memory-to-memory streaming toolkit on the production-grade Advanced Computing Ecosystem (ACE) infrastructure at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF). We present a workflow-specific evaluation of these architectures using three synthetic workloads derived from the streaming characteristics of scientific workflows. Through simulated experiments, we measure streaming throughput, round-trip time, and overhead under work sharing, work sharing with feedback, and broadcast and gather messaging patterns commonly found in AI-HPC communication motifs. Our study shows that DTS offers a minimal-hop path, resulting in higher throughput and lower latency, whereas MSS provides greater deployment feasibility and scalability across multiple users but incurs significant overhead. PRS lies in between, offering a scalable architecture whose performance matches DTS in most cases.

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further reference.

Abstract: The human auditory cortex is topographically organized. Neurons with similar response properties are spatially clustered, forming smooth maps for acoustic features such as frequency in early auditory areas, and modular regions selective for music and speech in higher-order cortex. Yet, evaluations for current computational models of auditory perception do not measure whether such topographic structure is present in a candidate model. Here, we show that cortical topography is not present in the previous best-performing models at predicting human auditory fMRI responses. To encourage the emergence of topographic organization, we adapt a cortical wiring-constraint loss originally designed for visual perception. The new class of topographic auditory models, TopoAudio, are trained to classify speech, and environmental sounds from cochleagram inputs, with an added constraint that nearby units on a 2D cortical sheet develop similar tuning. Despite these additional constraints, TopoAudio achieves high accuracy on benchmark tasks comparable to the unconstrained non-topographic baseline models. Further, TopoAudio predicts the fMRI responses in the brain as well as standard models, but unlike standard models, TopoAudio develops smooth, topographic maps for tonotopy and amplitude modulation (common properties of early auditory representation, as well as clustered response modules for music and speech (higher-order selectivity observed in the human auditory cortex). TopoAudio is the first end-to-end biologically grounded auditory model to exhibit emergent topography, and our results emphasize that a wiring-length constraint can serve as a general-purpose regularization tool to achieve biologically aligned representations.

Abstract: High-dimensional decision-making tasks, such as business partner selection, involve evaluating large candidate pools with heterogeneous numerical, categorical, and textual features. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong in-context reasoning capabilities, single-agent or debate-style systems often struggle with scalability and consistency in such settings. We propose PartnerMAS, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes evaluation into three layers: a Planner Agent that designs strategies, Specialized Agents that perform role-specific assessments, and a Supervisor Agent that integrates their outputs. To support systematic evaluation, we also introduce a curated benchmark dataset of venture capital co-investments, featuring diverse firm attributes and ground-truth syndicates. Across 140 cases, PartnerMAS consistently outperforms single-agent and debate-based multi-agent baselines, achieving up to 10--15\% higher match rates. Analysis of agent reasoning shows that planners are most responsive to domain-informed prompts, specialists produce complementary feature coverage, and supervisors play an important role in aggregation. Our findings demonstrate that structured collaboration among LLM agents can generate more robust outcomes than scaling individual models, highlighting PartnerMAS as a promising framework for high-dimensional decision-making in data-rich domains.

Abstract: The widespread availability of pre-trained vision models has enabled numerous deep learning applications through their transferable representations. However, their computational and storage costs often limit practical deployment. Pruning-at-Initialization has emerged as a promising approach to compress models before training, enabling efficient task-specific adaptation. While conventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific data, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out tasks' performance. We attribute this phenomenon to the favorable loss landscapes induced by extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the Q-function is a central challenge in offline reinforcement learning. However, existing approaches often rely on a single global Q-function, which struggles to capture the compositional nature of tasks involving diverse subtasks. We propose In-context Compositional Q-Learning (\texttt{ICQL}), the first offline RL framework that formulates Q-learning as a contextual inference problem, using linear Transformers to adaptively infer local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels. Theoretically, we show that under two assumptions--linear approximability of the local Q-function and accurate weight inference from retrieved context--\texttt{ICQL} achieves bounded Q-function approximation error, and supports near-optimal policy extraction. Empirically, \texttt{ICQL} substantially improves performance in offline settings: improving performance in kitchen tasks by up to 16.4\%, and in Gym and Adroit tasks by up to 8.6\% and 6.3\%. These results highlight the underexplored potential of in-context learning for robust and compositional value estimation, positioning \texttt{ICQL} as a principled and effective framework for offline RL.

Abstract: Strategy Choice Theory (SCT)\footnote{``Strategy Choice Theory'', ``Distributions of Associations'', and ``Overlapping Wave Theory'' have been used to refer to this line of work, emphasizing different aspects.}\citep[e.g.,][]{siegler1984strategychoices, siegler2000rebirth} explains important aspects of children's arithmetic learning based upon principles including learning from developmentally naturalistic data, probabilistic representation, confidence-based retrieval, and the phase-like importance of scaffolding strategies, such as finger-counting. Here we recast SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting practice\footnote{The original SCT model was pre-biased in accordance with the supposed experience of counting.}, symbol (number) embedding, and gated attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like'' use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Smart aquaculture systems depend on rich environmental data streams to protect fish welfare, optimize feeding, and reduce energy use. Yet public datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide, total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000 time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions (median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection, and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.

<title>Uncovering Grounding IDs: How External Cues Shape Multi-Modal Binding</title>

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures, such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together, our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and practical improvements in robustness.

Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D) communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs, PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context, reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

Abstract: Recent research has explored the constrained generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) when explicitly prompted by few task-specific requirements. In contrast, we introduce Large-Scale Constraint Generation (LSCG), a new problem that evaluates whether LLMs can parse a large, fine-grained, generic list of constraints. To examine the LLMs' ability to handle an increasing number constraints, we create a practical instance of LSCG, called Words Checker. In Words Checker, we evaluate the impact of model characteristics (e.g., size, family) and steering techniques (e.g., Simple Prompt, Chain of Thought, Best of N) on performance. We also propose FoCusNet, a small and dedicated model that parses the original list of constraints into a smaller subset, helping the LLM focus on relevant constraints. Experiments reveal that existing solutions suffer a significant performance drop as the number of constraints increases, with FoCusNet showing an 8-13% accuracy boost.

<title>PerfBench: Can Agents Resolve Real-World Performance Bugs?</title>

Abstract: Performance bugs are inefficiencies in software that waste computational resources without causing functional failures, making them particularly challenging to detect and fix. While recent advances in Software Engineering agents have shown promise in automated bug fixing, existing benchmarks primarily focus on functional correctness and fail to evaluate agents' abilities to identify and resolve non-functional issues like performance bugs. We introduce PerfBench, a benchmark comprising 81 real-world performance bug-fixing tasks from popular .NET repositories on GitHub. Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on pre-existing test suites, PerfBench features a novel evaluation harness that allows agents to generate their own performance benchmarks and validates fixes by comparing execution metrics collected for developer fix and agent fix. Each task in PerfBench is derived from actual developer fixes linked to performance-related issues, which are then verified by human experts, ensuring real-world relevance. Our evaluation reveals that current state-of-the-art coding agents struggle with performance optimization tasks, with baseline OpenHands agent achieving only a ~3% success rate on our benchmark. We develop OpenHands-Perf-Agent, which incorporates performance-aware tooling and instructions and achieves a ~20% success rate on the benchmark. We show that by ensuring the agent has proper instructions to benchmark its changes and tooling for benchmark output processing, we can improve the agent performance significantly, but room for improvement still remains. PerfBench provides a challenging test set for furthering the capabilities of agents in fixing performance issues.

<title>GEAR: A General Evaluation Framework for Abductive Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Since the advent of large language models (LLMs), research has focused on instruction following and deductive reasoning. A central question remains: can these models discover new knowledge, and how can we evaluate this ability? We address this by studying abductive reasoning-the generation of plausible hypotheses to explain observations-and introduce GEAR (General Evaluation for Abductive Reasoning), a general-purpose, fully automated, transparent, and label-free evaluation paradigm. GEAR scores hypothesis sets by three metrics: consistency (each hypothesis explains the observations), generalizability (consistent hypotheses make meaningful predictions on unseen inputs), and diversity (the set covers distinct predictions and patterns). Built this way, GEAR is scalable (no human gold answers), reliable (deterministic scoring aligned with classical abduction), and open-ended (scores improve only when models produce new plausible hypotheses, unlike static benchmarks that saturate once accuracy is high). Using GEAR, we conduct a fine-grained study of nine LLMs on four abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems, generating over 50,000 candidate hypotheses and revealing model differences obscured by gold-answer or purely human evaluations. We further propose a momentum-based curriculum that adjusts GEAR-derived training data by learning velocity: it starts with what the model learns quickly and shifts toward harder objectives such as generating diverse hypotheses once the model is confident on foundational objectives. Without gold-label supervision, this strategy improves all GEAR objectives and these gains transfer to established abductive reasoning benchmarks. Taken together, GEAR provides a principled framework that evaluates abduction and supplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more diverse and reliable hypotheses.

<title>Ancestry Tree Clustering for Particle Filter Diversity Maintenance</title>

Abstract: We propose a method for linear-time diversity maintenance in particle filtering. It clusters particles based on ancestry tree topology: closely related particles in sufficiently large subtrees are grouped together. The main idea is that the tree structure implicitly encodes similarity without the need for spatial or other domain-specific metrics. This approach, when combined with intra-cluster fitness sharing and the protection of particles not included in a cluster, effectively prevents premature convergence in multimodal environments while maintaining estimate compactness. We validate our approach in a multimodal robotics simulation and a real-world multimodal indoor environment. We compare the performance to several diversity maintenance algorithms from the literature, including Deterministic Resampling and Particle Gaussian Mixtures. Our algorithm achieves high success rates with little to no negative effect on compactness, showing particular robustness to different domains and challenging initial conditions.

<title>The Impossibility of Inverse Permutation Learning in Transformer Models</title>

arXiv:2509.24125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this technical note, we study the problem of inverse permutation learning in decoder-only transformers. Given a permutation and a string to which that permutation has been applied, the model is tasked with producing the original (``canonical'') string. We argue that this task models a natural robustness property across a variety of reasoning tasks, including long-context retrieval, multiple choice QA and in-context learning. Our primary contribution is an impossibility result: we show that an arbitrary depth, decoder-only transformer cannot learn this task. This result concerns the expressive capacity of decoder-only transformer models and is agnostic to training dynamics or sample complexity. We give a pair of alternative constructions under which inverse permutation learning is feasible. The first of these highlights the fundamental role of the causal attention mask, and reveals a gap between the expressivity of encoder-decoder transformers and the more popular decoder-only architecture. The latter result is more surprising: we show that simply padding the input with ``scratch tokens" yields a construction under which inverse permutation learning is possible. We conjecture that this may suggest an alternative mechanism by which chain-of-thought prompting or, more generally, intermediate ``thinking'' tokens can enable reasoning in large language models, even when these tokens encode no meaningful semantic information (e.g., the results of intermediate computations).

Abstract: Active vision (AV) has been in the spotlight of robotics research due to its emergence in numerous applications including agricultural tasks such as precision crop monitoring and autonomous harvesting to list a few. A major AV problem that gained popularity is the 3D reconstruction of targeted environments using 2D images from diverse viewpoints. While collecting and processing a large number of arbitrarily captured 2D images can be arduous in many practical scenarios, a more efficient solution involves optimizing the placement of available cameras in 3D space to capture fewer, yet more informative, images that provide sufficient visual information for effective reconstruction of the environment of interest. This process termed as view planning (VP), can be markedly challenged (i) by noise emerging in the location of the cameras and/or in the extracted images, and (ii) by the need to generalize well in other unknown similar agricultural environments without need for re-optimizing or re-training. To cope with these challenges, the present work presents a novel VP framework that considers a reconstruction quality-based optimization formulation that relies on the notion of `structure-from-motion' to reconstruct the 3D structure of the sought environment from the selected 2D images. With no analytic expression of the optimization function and with costly function evaluations, a Bayesian optimization approach is proposed to efficiently carry out the VP process using only a few function evaluations, while accounting for different noise cases. Numerical tests on both simulated and real agricultural settings signify the benefits of the advocated VP approach in efficiently estimating the optimal camera placement to accurately reconstruct 3D environments of interest, and generalize well on similar unknown environments.

On MACHO R-band, AstroCo outperforms Astromer v1 and v2, yielding 70 percent and 61 percent lower error respectively and a relative macro-F1 gain of about 7 percent, while producing embeddings that transfer effectively to few-shot classification. These results highlight AstroCo's potential as a strong and label-efficient foundation for time-domain astronomy.

Abstract: Retinal disease diagnosis is critical in preventing vision loss and reducing socioeconomic burdens. Globally, over 2.2 billion people are affected by some form of vision impairment, resulting in annual productivity losses estimated at $411 billion. Traditional manual grading of retinal fundus images by ophthalmologists is time-consuming and subjective. In contrast, deep learning has revolutionized medical diagnostics by automating retinal image analysis and achieving expert-level performance. In this study, we present EYE-DEX, an automated framework for classifying 10 retinal conditions using the large-scale Retinal Disease Dataset comprising 21,577 eye fundus images. We benchmark three pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models--VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50--with our finetuned VGG16 achieving a state-of-the-art global benchmark test accuracy of 92.36%. To enhance transparency and explainability, we integrate the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to generate visual explanations highlighting disease-specific regions, thereby fostering clinician trust and reliability in AI-assisted diagnostics.

Abstract: Current comparisons of large reasoning models (LRMs) focus on macro-level statistics such as task accuracy or reasoning length. Whether different LRMs reason differently remains an open question. To address this gap, we introduce the LLM-proposed Open Taxonomy (LOT), a classification method that uses a generative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs and articulate their distinctive features in words. LOT then models how these features predict the source LRM of a reasoning trace based on their empirical distributions across LRM outputs. Iterating this process over a dataset of reasoning traces yields a human-readable taxonomy that characterizes how models think. We apply LOT to compare the reasoning of 12 open-source LRMs on tasks in math, science, and coding. LOT identifies systematic differences in their thoughts, achieving 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from LRMs that differ in scale, base model family, or objective domain. Beyond classification, LOT's natural-language taxonomy provides qualitative explanations of how LRMs think differently. Finally, in a case study, we link the reasoning differences to performance: aligning the reasoning style of smaller Qwen3 models with that of the largest Qwen3 during test time improves their accuracy on GPQA by 3.3-5.7%.

Abstract: Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a widely adopted software engineering practice that requires developers to create and execute tests alongside code implementation, ensuring that software behavior is continuously validated and refined. In the era of vibe coding, where developers increasingly delegate code writing to large language models (LLMs) by specifying high-level intentions, TDD becomes even more crucial, as test cases serve as executable specifications that explicitly define and verify intended functionality beyond what natural-language descriptions and code context can convey. While vibe coding under TDD is promising, there are three main challenges: (1) selecting a small yet effective test suite to improve the generation accuracy and control the execution workload, (2) retrieving context such as relevant code effectively, and (3) systematically using test feedback for effective code refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce TENET, an LLM agent for generating functions in complex real-world repositories under the TDD setting. TENET features three components: (1) a novel test harness mechanism that selects a concise test suite to maximize diversity of target usage scenarios; (2) a tailored agent toolset that performs efficient retrieval of relevant code with interactive debugging; and (3) a reflection-based refinement workflow that iteratively analyzes failures, replenishes context, and applies code refinement. TENET achieves 69.08% and 81.77% Pass@1 on RepoCod and RepoEval benchmarks, outperforming the best agentic baselines by 9.49 and 2.17 percentage points, respectively. In addition, this is the first study of test-driven code generation with repository-level context, examining how different aspects of test suites affect the performance of LLM agents under the TDD setting.

Abstract: The early and accurate classification of brain tumors is crucial for guiding effective treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. This study presents BrainFusion, a significant advancement in brain tumor analysis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by combining fine-tuned convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tumor classification--including VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception--with YOLOv8 for precise tumor localization with bounding boxes. Leveraging the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset, our experiments reveal that the fine-tuned VGG16 model achieves test accuracy of 99.86%, substantially exceeding previous benchmarks. Beyond setting a new accuracy standard, the integration of bounding-box localization and explainable AI techniques further enhances both the clinical interpretability and trustworthiness of the system's outputs. Overall, this approach underscores the transformative potential of deep learning in delivering faster, more reliable diagnoses, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and survival rates.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored in robot manipulation, but many existing methods struggle to adapt to new environments. Many systems require either environment-specific policy training or depend on fixed prompts and single-shot code generation, leading to limited transferability and manual re-tuning. We introduce Memory Transfer Planning (MTP), a framework that leverages successful control-code examples from different environments as procedural knowledge, using them as in-context guidance for LLM-driven planning. Specifically, MTP (i) generates an initial plan and code using LLMs, (ii) retrieves relevant successful examples from a code memory, and (iii) contextually adapts the retrieved code to the target setting for re-planning without updating model parameters. We evaluate MTP on RLBench, CALVIN, and a physical robot, demonstrating effectiveness beyond simulation. Across these settings, MTP consistently improved success rate and adaptability compared with fixed-prompt code generation, naive retrieval, and memory-free re-planning. Furthermore, in hardware experiments, leveraging a memory constructed in simulation proved effective. MTP provides a practical approach that exploits procedural knowledge to realize robust LLM-based planning across diverse robotic manipulation scenarios, enhancing adaptability to novel environments and bridging simulation and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment, reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Abstract: Machine unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is essential for privacy and safety; however, existing approaches remain unstable and unreliable. A widely used strategy, the gradient difference method, applies gradient descent on retained data while performing gradient ascent on forget data, the data whose influence should be removed. However, when combined with cross-entropy loss, this procedure causes unbounded growth of weights and gradients, leading to training instability and degrading both forgetting and retention. We provide a theoretical framework that explains this failure, explicitly showing how ascent on the forget set destabilizes optimization in the feedforward MLP layers of LLMs. Guided by this insight, we propose Bounded Parameter-Efficient Unlearning, a parameter-efficient approach that stabilizes LoRA-based fine-tuning by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters. This simple modification controls the weight dynamics during ascent, enabling the gradient difference method to converge reliably. Across the TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE benchmarks, and across architectures and scales from 125M to 8B parameters, our method achieves substantial improvements in forgetting while preserving retention, establishing a novel theoretically grounded and practically scalable framework for unlearning in LLMs.

Abstract: GUI agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in automating complex digital tasks. However, their effectiveness in real-world applications is often limited by scarce training data and the inherent complexity of these tasks, which frequently require long-tailed knowledge covering rare, unseen scenarios. We propose RAG-GUI , a lightweight VLM that leverages web tutorials at inference time. RAG-GUI is first warm-started via supervised finetuning (SFT) and further refined through self-guided rejection sampling finetuning (RSF). Designed to be model-agnostic, RAG-GUI functions as a generic plug-in that enhances any VLM-based agent. Evaluated across three distinct tasks, it consistently outperforms baseline agents and surpasses other inference baselines by 2.6% to 13.3% across two model sizes, demonstrating strong generalization and practical plug-and-play capabilities in real-world scenarios.

Traditional accuracy metrics fail inadequately as they neither capture question characteristics nor offer topic-specific insights. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{MedIRT}, a rigorous evaluation framework grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT), the gold standard in high-stakes educational testing. Unlike previous research relying on archival data, we prospectively gathered fresh responses from 80 diverse LLMs on a balanced, 1,100-question USMLE-aligned benchmark. Using one unidimensional two-parameter logistic IRT model per topic, we estimate LLM's latent model ability jointly with question difficulty and discrimination, yielding more stable and nuanced performance rankings than accuracy alone. Notably, we identify distinctive ``spiky'' ability profiles, where overall rankings can be misleading due to highly specialized model abilities. While \texttt{GPT-5} was the top performer in a majority of domains (8 of 11), it was outperformed in Social Science and Communication by \texttt{Claude-3-opus}, demonstrating that even an overall 23rd-ranked model can hold the top spot for specific competencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate IRT's utility in auditing benchmarks by identifying flawed questions. We synthesize these findings into a practical decision-support framework that integrates our multi-factor competency profiles with operational metrics. This work establishes a robust, psychometrically grounded methodology essential for the safe, effective, and trustworthy deployment of LLMs in healthcare.

<title>Talk in Pieces, See in Whole: Disentangling and Hierarchical Aggregating Representations for Language-based Object Detection</title>

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects, attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole"). Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of linguistic compositionality.

<title>AceSearcher: Bootstrapping Reasoning and Search for LLMs via Reinforced Self-Play</title>

Abstract: Search-augmented LLMs often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to ineffective multi-hop retrieval and limited reasoning ability. We propose AceSearcher, a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single large language model (LLM) to alternate between two roles: a decomposer that breaks down complex queries and a solver that integrates retrieved contexts for answer generation. AceSearcher couples supervised fine-tuning on a diverse mixture of search, reasoning, and decomposition tasks with reinforcement fine-tuning optimized for final answer accuracy, eliminating the need for intermediate annotations. Extensive experiments on three reasoning-intensive tasks across 10 datasets show that AceSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average exact match improvement of 7.6%. Remarkably, on document-level finance reasoning tasks, AceSearcher-32B matches the performance of the DeepSeek-V3 model using less than 5% of its parameters. Even at smaller scales (1.5B and 8B), AceSearcher often surpasses existing search-augmented LLMs with up to 9x more parameters, highlighting its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness in tackling complex reasoning tasks. Our code will be published at https://github.com/ritaranx/AceSearcher and https://huggingface.co/AceSearcher.

Abstract: Traditional metasurface design is limited by the computational cost of full-wave simulations, preventing thorough exploration of complex configurations. Data-driven approaches have emerged as a solution to this bottleneck, replacing costly simulations with rapid neural network evaluations and enabling near-instant design for meta-atoms. Despite advances, implementing a new optical function still requires building and training a task-specific network, along with exhaustive searches for suitable architectures and hyperparameters. Pre-trained large language models (LLMs), by contrast, sidestep this laborious process with a simple fine-tuning technique. However, applying LLMs to the design of nanophotonic devices, particularly for arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces, is still in its early stages; as such tasks often require graphical networks. Here, we show that an LLM, fed with descriptive inputs of arbitrarily shaped metasurface geometries, can learn the physical relationships needed for spectral prediction and inverse design. We further benchmarked a range of open-weight LLMs and identified relationships between accuracy and model size at the billion-parameter level. We demonstrated that 1-D token-wise LLMs provide a practical tool to designing 2-D arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces. Linking natural-language interaction to electromagnetic modelling, this "chat-to-chip" workflow represents a step toward more user-friendly data-driven nanophotonics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings, where overconfident responses can mislead users. Reliable confidence estimation has been shown to enhance trust and task accuracy. Yet existing methods face practical barriers: logits are often hidden, multi-sampling is computationally expensive, and verbalized numerical uncertainty (e.g., giving a 0-100 score) deviates from natural communication. We revisit linguistic confidence (LC), where models express uncertainty through hedging language (e.g., probably, might), offering a lightweight and human-centered alternative. To advance this direction, we (1) release the first diverse, large-scale dataset of hedging expressions with human-annotated confidence scores, and (2) propose a lightweight mapper that converts hedges into confidence scores at near-zero cost. Building on these resources, we (3) conduct the first systematic study of LC across modern LLMs and QA benchmarks, revealing that while most LLMs underperform in expressing reliable LC, carefully designed prompting achieves competitive calibration and discriminability. Finally, we (4) introduce a fine-tuning framework that further improves LC reliability. Taken together, our work positions linguistic confidence as a scalable, efficient, and human-aligned approach to LLM uncertainty estimation, and calls for deeper exploration of this promising yet underexplored direction.

<title>Group-Relative REINFORCE Is Secretly an Off-Policy Algorithm: Demystifying Some Myths About GRPO and Its Friends</title>

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss, and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is available at https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/rec_gsm8k.

Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice, fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8% (11.7M) of its parameters.

Abstract: Evaluating language models fairly is becoming harder as static benchmarks available on the internet risk contamination by training data. This makes it unclear whether models are truly reasoning or just recalling answers. In this paper, we introduce BeyondBench, an evaluation framework that avoids this problem by using algorithmic problem generation. Unlike traditional benchmarks that risk contamination from internet-scale training data, BeyondBench creates mathematically grounded problems on the fly, ensuring each test remains fresh and uncontaminated. Our framework covers 44 algorithmic tasks with a total of 117 variations, grouped into three difficulty levels: the Easy Suite (29 tasks) for basic arithmetic and statistics, the Medium Suite (5 tasks, 49 variations) for sequence patterns and reasoning, and the Hard Suite (10 tasks, 68 variations) tackling NP-complete and constraint satisfaction problems. Each task generates problems from a combinatorial space larger than 10^15 unique instances, with solutions verified deterministically by mathematical proofs. We evaluated 101 language models, including 85 open-source and 16 closed-source models, spanning sizes from 0.5B to 141B parameters and multiple quantization schemes. Our results show consistent reasoning deficiencies across model families, with performance degrading sharply as problem complexity increases from polynomial to exponential. In our Hard Suite evaluations, models such as Gemini-2.5-pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Qwen2.5-72B achieved average accuracies of 56.38%, 26.91%, and 33.60%, respectively. Moreover, we observe that performance drops drastically without tool usage, with GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5-nano showing a decline of 16.81%, 28.05%, and 47.59% accuracy on the hard suite. Our leaderboard is publicly available at https://ctrl-gaurav.github.io/BeyondBench/

Abstract: The rapid growth of audio-centric platforms and applications such as WhatsApp and Twitter has transformed the way people communicate and share audio content in modern society. However, these platforms are increasingly misused to disseminate harmful audio content, such as hate speech, deceptive advertisements, and explicit material, which can have significant negative consequences (e.g., detrimental effects on mental health). In response, researchers and practitioners have been actively developing and deploying audio content moderation tools to tackle this issue. Despite these efforts, malicious actors can bypass moderation systems by making subtle alterations to audio content, such as modifying pitch or inserting noise. Moreover, the effectiveness of modern audio moderation tools against such adversarial inputs remains insufficiently studied. To address these challenges, we propose MTAM, a Metamorphic Testing framework for Audio content Moderation software. Specifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2000 audio clips and define 14 metamorphic relations across two perturbation categories: Audio Features-Based and Heuristic perturbations. MTAM applies these metamorphic relations to toxic audio content to generate test cases that remain harmful while being more likely to evade detection. In our evaluation, we employ MTAM to test five commercial textual content moderation software and an academic model against three kinds of toxic content. The results show that MTAM achieves up to 38.6%, 18.3%, 35.1%, 16.7%, and 51.1% error finding rates (EFR) when testing commercial moderation software provided by Gladia, Assembly AI, Baidu, Nextdata, and Tencent, respectively, and it obtains up to 45.7% EFR when testing the state-of-the-art algorithms from the academy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization and emergent capabilities, yet their pre-training remains computationally expensive and sensitive to optimization dynamics. While Adam-based optimizers offer fast convergence by adapting learning rates coordinate-wise, recent studies reveal that their updates often suffer from poor spectral conditioning and low-rank structures, hindering efficiency. Muon addresses this issue via global spectral normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we propose \textbf{Column-Normalized Adam (Conda)}, a novel optimizer that bridges the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on the LLaMA series, \textbf{Conda achieves $2{\sim}2.5\times$ the convergence speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time.} Further ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable optimizer for large-scale LLM training. The code is released on https://github.com/jie040109/Conda

Abstract: Robots trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Imitation Learning (IL) often adapt slowly to new tasks, whereas recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promise knowledge-rich planning from minimal data. Deploying LLMs/VLMs for motion planning, however, faces two key obstacles: (i) symbolic plans are rarely grounded in scene geometry and object physics, and (ii) model outputs can vary for identical prompts, undermining execution reliability. We propose ViReSkill, a framework that pairs vision-grounded replanning with a skill memory for accumulation and reuse. When a failure occurs, the replanner generates a new action sequence conditioned on the current scene, tailored to the observed state. On success, the executed plan is stored as a reusable skill and replayed in future encounters without additional calls to LLMs/VLMs. This feedback loop enables autonomous continual learning: each attempt immediately expands the skill set and stabilizes subsequent executions. We evaluate ViReSkill on simulators such as LIBERO and RLBench as well as on a physical robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms conventional baselines in task success rate, demonstrating robust sim-to-real generalization.

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on various and unlabeled data have demonstrated significant success in natural language and vision, but their application to electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenged due to the signal's unique properties. Existing brain foundation models that inherit architectures designed for text or images lead to three limitations in pre-training: 1) conflating time-domain waveform patterns with frequency-domain rhythmic features in a single processing stream, 2) ignoring the critical spatial topology of electrodes with different standards, and 3) reliance on the inflexible, dense network to process functionally distinct EEG patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce the Unified Neural Topological Foundation Model (Uni-NTFM), which is designed based on neuroscience principles to produce universal and interpretable representations. Uni-NTFM integrates three core innovations: 1) a decoupled architecture parallelly encodes time, frequency, and raw signal representations before performing cross-domain feature integration; 2) a topological embedding mechanism to unify electrodes from different international standards and generate structured input sequences for brain regions; and 3) a Mixture-of-Experts neural Transformer that efficiently scales model capacity by routing signal patterns to specialized subnetworks. The largest model, Uni-NTFM$_{large}$, has a record-breaking 1.9B parameters and was pretrained on over 28,000 hours of diverse EEG data via a dual-domain masked reconstruction objective. Uni-NTFM significantly outperforms existing task-specific methods and foundation models across nine distinct downstream tasks under both linear probing and fine-tuning settings, demonstrating a superior ability to learn universal representations of brain activity.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities. However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension, and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard. The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance, approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.

Abstract: Generative planners based on flow matching (FM) can produce high-quality paths in one or a few ODE steps, but their sampling dynamics offer no formal safety guarantees and can yield incomplete paths near constraints. We present SafeFlowMatcher, a planning framework that couples FM with control barrier functions (CBFs) to achieve both real-time efficiency and certified safety. SafeFlowMatcher uses a two-phase prediction-correction (PC) integrator: (i) a prediction phase integrates the learned FM once (or a few steps) to obtain a candidate path without intervention; (ii) a correction phase refines this path with a vanishing time-scaled vector field and a CBF-based quadratic program that minimally perturbs the vector field. We prove a barrier certificate for the resulting flow system, establishing forward invariance of a robust safe set and finite-time convergence to the safe set. By enforcing safety only on the executed path (rather than on all intermediate latent paths), SafeFlowMatcher avoids distributional drift and mitigates local trap problems. Across maze navigation and locomotion benchmarks, SafeFlowMatcher attains faster, smoother, and safer paths than diffusion- and FM-based baselines. Extensive ablations corroborate the contributions of the PC integrator and the barrier certificate.

Abstract: Prompt optimization and fine-tuning are two major approaches to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). They enhance the capabilities of LLMs from complementary perspectives: the former through explicit natural language, and the latter through implicit parameter updates. However, prior work has typically studied them in isolation, leaving their synergistic potential largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we introduce MetaTuner, a novel framework that jointly integrates prompt optimization and fine-tuning for LLM training. Specifically, we introduce two neural networks to generate prompts and parameters, respectively, while allowing them to share a common bottom encoding layer to enable knowledge sharing. By the guidance of the final supervised signals, our framework is optimized to discover the optimal combinations between the prompts and parameters. Given that prompt learning involves discrete optimization while fine-tuning operates in a continuous parameter space, we design a supervised regularization loss to train our framework effectively. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms the baselines.

Abstract: The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for applying foundation model innovations to OR.

Abstract: Identifying DNA- (DBPs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is crucial for the understanding of cell function, molecular interactions as well as regulatory functions. Owing to their high similarity, most of the existing approaches face challenges in differentiating between DBPs and RBPs leading to high cross-prediction errors. Moreover, identifying proteins which bind to both DNA and RNA (DRBPs) is also quite a challenging task. In this regard, we propose a novel framework viz. LAMP-PRo which is based on pre-trained protein language model (PLM), attention mechanisms and multi-label learning to mitigate these issues. First, pre-trained PLM such ESM-2 is used for embedding the protein sequences followed by convolutional neural network (CNN). Subsequently multi-head self-attention mechanism is applied for the contextual information while label-aware attention is used to compute class-specific representations by attending to the sequence in a way that is tailored to each label (DBP, RBP and non-NABP) in a multi-label setup. We have also included a novel cross-label attention mechanism to explicitly capture dependencies between DNA- and RNA-binding proteins, enabling more accurate prediction of DRBP. Finally, a linear layer followed by a sigmoid function are used for the final prediction. Extensive experiments are carried out to compare LAMP-PRo with the existing methods wherein the proposed model shows consistent competent performance. Furthermore, we also provide visualization to showcase model interpretability, highlighting which parts of the sequence are most relevant for a predicted label. The original datasets are available at http://bliulab.net/iDRBP\_MMC and the codes are available at https://github.com/NimishaGhosh/LAMP-PRo.

Abstract: Deep generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image synthesis. However, ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints, enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation, counterfactual, and disease progression modeling.

<title>Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Framework for ESP Cheater Simulation</title>

Abstract: Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP) cheats, which reveal hidden in-game information such as enemy locations, are difficult to detect because their effects are not directly observable in player behavior. The lack of observable evidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is essential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters often adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which further complicates detection and detector development. To address these challenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP cheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of observability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we formulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an adversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect realistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that dynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on detection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward optimization and detection evasion. This work provides a controllable and extensible platform for studying adaptive cheating behaviors and developing effective cheat detectors.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at multi-step, tool-augmented tasks. However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables. By building the simulator on the Matter protocol (the global industry standard for smart home communication), SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment, and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600 episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned capabilities. Our evaluation of 11 agents under a unified ReAct framework reveals that while models perform well on simple tasks, they struggle with latent intent inference, state verification, and especially temporal scheduling. Even the top-performing model, GPT-4.1, reaches only 54% success rate. These findings highlight a critical need for methods that can reliably verify the current state via tools before acting and coordinate time-dependent actions.

<title>Let LLMs Speak Embedding Languages: Generative Text Embeddings via Iterative Contrastive Refinement</title>

Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM)-based embeddings typically adopt an encoder-only paradigm, treating LLMs as static feature extractors and overlooking their core generative strengths. We introduce GIRCSE (Generative Iterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework that leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic representations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics that encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each refinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show that GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB benchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an emergent test-time scaling property: generating more tokens at inference steadily improves embedding quality. Our results establish generative iterative refinement as a new paradigm for representation learning.

<title>DiffuGuard: How Intrinsic Safety is Lost and Found in Diffusion Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) introduces unprecedented vulnerabilities that are fundamentally distinct from Autoregressive LLMs, stemming from their iterative and parallel generation mechanisms. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of dLLM vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks across two distinct dimensions: intra-step and inter-step dynamics. Experimental results reveal a harmful bias inherent in the standard greedy remasking strategy and identify a critical phenomenon we term Denoising-path Dependence, where the safety of early-stage tokens decisively influences the final output. These findings also indicate that while current decoding strategies constitute a significant vulnerability, dLLMs possess a substantial intrinsic safety potential. To unlock this potential, we propose DiffuGuard, a training-free defense framework that addresses vulnerabilities through a dual-stage approach: Stochastic Annealing Remasking dynamically introduces controlled randomness to mitigate greedy selection bias, while Block-level Audit and Repair exploits internal model representations for autonomous risk detection and guided correction. Comprehensive experiments on four dLLMs demonstrate DiffuGuard's exceptional effectiveness, reducing Attack Success Rate against six diverse jailbreak methods from 47.9% to 14.7% while preserving model utility and efficiency. Our code is available at: https://github.com/niez233/DiffuGuard.

Abstract: High-quality, multi-modal benchmarks are crucial for advancing scientific reasoning in large models yet their manual creation is costly and unscalable. To address this bottleneck, we explore the potential for transforming Text-Only QA Pairs (TQAs) into high-quality Multi-Modal QA Pairs (MMQAs), which include three parts: 1) Task Definition \& Evaluation Rubric: We develop a TQA-to-MMQA framework and establish a comprehensive, multi-dimensional MMQA quality rubric that provides principles for the transformation. 2) Benchmark Construction: Then we construct two extensive benchmarks to rigorously evaluate state-of-the-art generation \& understanding models on the distinct tasks of MMQA generation \& MMQA quality evaluation. 3) Preliminary Solution: We develop an agentic system (Q-Mirror), which operationalizes our framework by integrating MMQA generation and evaluation into a closed loop for iterative refinement. Our experiments show that while state-of-the-art models can generate MMQAs, their outputs still leave substantial gaps, underscoring the need for reliable evaluation. We further demonstrate that top-tier understanding models align closely with human judgment in MMQA quality assessment. Leveraging both insights, the Q-Mirror agent raises average scores from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72\% to 95\%, offering a practical path to large-scale scientific benchmarks.

<title>Bridging the behavior-neural gap: A multimodal AI reveals the brain's geometry of emotion more accurately than human self-reports</title>

Abstract: The ability to represent emotion plays a significant role in human cognition and social interaction, yet the high-dimensional geometry of this affective space and its neural underpinnings remain debated. A key challenge, the `behavior-neural gap,' is the limited ability of human self-reports to predict brain activity. Here we test the hypothesis that this gap arises from the constraints of traditional rating scales and that large-scale similarity judgments can more faithfully capture the brain's affective geometry. Using AI models as `cognitive agents,' we collected millions of triplet odd-one-out judgments from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and a language-only model (LLM) in response to 2,180 emotionally evocative videos. We found that the emergent 30-dimensional embeddings from these models are highly interpretable and organize emotion primarily along categorical lines, yet in a blended fashion that incorporates dimensional properties. Most remarkably, the MLLM's representation predicted neural activity in human emotion-processing networks with the highest accuracy, outperforming not only the LLM but also, counterintuitively, representations derived directly from human behavioral ratings. This result supports our primary hypothesis and suggests that sensory grounding--learning from rich visual data--is critical for developing a truly neurally-aligned conceptual framework for emotion. Our findings provide compelling evidence that MLLMs can autonomously develop rich, neurally-aligned affective representations, offering a powerful paradigm to bridge the gap between subjective experience and its neural substrates.

Abstract: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a foundation of soil health and global climate resilience, yet its prediction remains difficult because of intricate physical, chemical, and biological processes. In this study, we explore a Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) framework built on Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to forecast SOC dynamics across soil depth and time. UDEs blend mechanistic physics, such as advection diffusion transport, with neural networks that learn nonlinear microbial production and respiration. Using synthetic datasets, we systematically evaluated six experimental cases, progressing from clean, noise free benchmarks to stress tests with high (35%) multiplicative, spatially correlated noise. Our results highlight both the potential and limitations of the approach. In noise free and moderate noise settings, the UDE accurately reconstructed SOC dynamics. In clean terminal profile at 50 years (Case 4) achieved near perfect fidelity, with MSE = 1.6e-5, and R2 = 0.9999. Case 5, with 7% noise, remained robust (MSE = 3.4e-6, R2 = 0.99998), capturing depth wise SOC trends while tolerating realistic measurement uncertainty. In contrast, Case 3 (35% noise at t = 0) showed clear evidence of overfitting: the model reproduced noisy inputs with high accuracy but lost generalization against the clean truth (R2 = 0.94). Case 6 (35% noise at t = 50) collapsed toward overly smooth mean profiles, failing to capture depth wise variability and yielding negative R2, underscoring the limits of standard training under severe uncertainty. These findings suggest that UDEs are well suited for scalable, noise tolerant SOC forecasting, though advancing toward field deployment will require noise aware loss functions, probabilistic modelling, and tighter integration of microbial dynamics.

<title>Dual Mechanisms of Value Expression: Intrinsic vs. Prompted Values in LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can express different values in two distinct ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts. Given their widespread use in value alignment and persona steering, it is paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on substantially different mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream, and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions. We demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common components that are crucial for inducing value expression, but also possess unique elements that manifest in different ways. As a result, these mechanisms lead to different degrees of value steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and response diversity (intrinsic > prompted). In particular, components unique to the intrinsic mechanism seem to promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas those specific to the prompted mechanism primarily strengthen instruction following, taking effect even in distant tasks like jailbreaking.

Abstract: We introduce a psychologically grounded and artist-informed framework for modeling visual creativity across four domains: Inner, Outer, Imaginative, and Moral Worlds. Drawing on interviews with practicing artists and theories from psychology, we define 12 traits that capture affective, symbolic, cultural, and ethical dimensions of creativity.Using 20k artworks from the SemArt dataset, we annotate images with GPT 4.1 using detailed, theory-aligned prompts, and evaluate the learnability of these traits from CLIP image embeddings. Traits such as Environmental Dialogicity and Redemptive Arc are predicted with high reliability ($R^2 \approx 0.64 - 0.68$), while others like Memory Imprint remain challenging, highlighting the limits of purely visual encoding. Beyond technical metrics, we visualize a "creativity trait-space" and illustrate how it can support interpretable, trait-aware co-creation - e.g., sliding along a Redemptive Arc axis to explore works of adversity and renewal. By linking cultural-aesthetic insights with computational modeling, our work aims not to reduce creativity to numbers, but to offer shared language and interpretable tools for artists, researchers, and AI systems to collaborate meaningfully.

<title>Towards Generalizable PDE Dynamics Forecasting via Physics-Guided Invariant Learning</title>

Abstract: Advanced deep learning-based approaches have been actively applied to forecast the spatiotemporal physical dynamics governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), which acts as a critical procedure in tackling many science and engineering problems. As real-world physical environments like PDE system parameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is of great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on discovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics trajectories. However, their zero-shot OOD generalization capability remains deficient, since extra test-time samples for domain-specific adaptation are still required. This is because the fundamental physical invariance in PDE dynamical systems are yet to be investigated or integrated. To this end, we first explicitly define a two-fold PDE invariance principle, which points out that ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant across different domains and PDE system evolution. Next, to capture this two-fold PDE invariance, we propose a physics-guided invariant learning method termed iMOOE, featuring an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective. Extensive experiments across simulated benchmarks and real-world applications validate iMOOE's superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization capabilities on diverse OOD forecasting scenarios.

Abstract: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages. Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning, answer drafting, and iterative improvement.
  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias. The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized. Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

Abstract: Most studies on language model pretraining focus on large datasets, leaving open questions about optimization in data-constrained settings. In such settings, the effects of training data order and of including alternative versions of the same text remain underexplored. We address this by studying curriculum learning in pretraining, focusing on text-complexity ordering and data augmentation via simplification. We ask: (1) Does simplifying texts enhance representation quality more than reusing the original data? and (2) Does ordering data by text complexity yield better representations? To answer, we build on a pair of parallel corpora where human-written paragraphs are aligned with LLM-simplified variants, and test four data schedules: repeated exposure, low-to-high complexity, high-to-low, and interleaved. We analyze models' representation quality from a sample efficiency perspective via fine-tuning, as well as its zero-shot performance on linguistic knowledge, entity tracking, world knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our findings show that adding simplified data improves fine-tuning and zero-shot performance over a repeated-exposure baseline: smaller models benefit from low-to-high complexity, while larger models perform better with interleaved ordering.

Abstract: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information. To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets, demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves a balance between model performance and model complexity.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks.

arXiv:2509.24365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR) transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs, modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture. Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing, while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at https://github.com/CURRENTF/Uni-X

Abstract: We introduce the first watermark tailored for diffusion language models (DLMs), an emergent LLM paradigm able to generate tokens in arbitrary order, in contrast to standard autoregressive language models (ARLMs) which generate tokens sequentially. While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a >99% true positive rate with minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.

Abstract: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations, thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details, including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as clouds.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters, was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency, tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond what current RL techniques provide.

Abstract: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences, but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT, our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric (EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains, while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step orderings and filter out noise.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical for their safe deployment, yet jailbreak attacks can subvert this alignment to elicit harmful outputs from LLMs. In recent years, a proliferation of jailbreak attacks has emerged, accompanied by diverse metrics and judges to assess the harmfulness of the LLM outputs. However, the absence of a systematic benchmark to assess the quality and effectiveness of these metrics and judges undermines the credibility of the reported jailbreak effectiveness and other risks. To address this gap, we introduce HarmMetric Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to support both overall and fine-grained evaluation of harmfulness metrics and judges. Our benchmark includes a high-quality dataset of representative harmful prompts paired with diverse harmful and non-harmful model responses, alongside a flexible scoring mechanism compatible with various metrics and judges. With HarmMetric Eval, our extensive experiments uncover a surprising result: two conventional metrics--METEOR and ROUGE-1--outperform LLM-based judges in evaluating the harmfulness of model responses, challenging prevailing beliefs about LLMs' superiority in this domain. Our dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/qusgo/HarmMetric_Eval, and the code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HarmMetric-Eval-4CBE.

Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However, extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy, realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks, demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce LLaDA-MoE, a large language diffusion model with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, trained from scratch on approximately 20T tokens. LLaDA-MoE achieves competitive performance with significantly reduced computational overhead by maintaining a 7B-parameter capacity while activating only 1.4B parameters during inference. Our empirical evaluation reveals that LLaDA-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion language models with larger parameters, surpassing previous diffusion language models LLaDA, LLaDA 1.5, and Dream across multiple benchmarks. The instruct-tuned model LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct demonstrates capabilities comparable to Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct in knowledge understanding, code generation, mathematical reasoning, agent and alignment tasks, despite using fewer active parameters. Our results show that integrating a sparse MoE architecture into the training objective of masked diffusion language models still brings out MoE's strengths under efficient inference with few active parameters, and opens ample room for further exploration of diffusion language models. LLaDA-MoE models are available at Huggingface.

Abstract: Prominent AI companies are producing 'safety frameworks' as a type of voluntary self-governance. These statements purport to establish risk thresholds and safety procedures for the development and deployment of highly capable AI. Understanding which AI risks are covered and what actions are allowed, refused, demanded, encouraged, or discouraged by these statements is vital for assessing how these frameworks actually govern AI development and deployment. We draw on affordance theory to analyse the OpenAI 'Preparedness Framework Version 2' (April 2025) using the Mechanisms & Conditions model of affordances and the MIT AI Risk Repository. We find that this safety policy requests evaluation of a small minority of AI risks, encourages deployment of systems with 'Medium' capabilities for what OpenAI itself defines as 'severe harm' (potential for >1000 deaths or >$100B in damages), and allows OpenAI's CEO to deploy even more dangerous capabilities. These findings suggest that effective mitigation of AI risks requires more robust governance interventions beyond current industry self-regulation. Our affordance analysis provides a replicable method for evaluating what safety frameworks actually permit versus what they claim.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables natural access to databases, yet most benchmarks are English-only, limiting multilingual progress. We introduce MultiSpider 2.0, extending Spider 2.0 to eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese). It preserves Spider 2.0's structural difficulty while adding linguistic and dialectal variability, demanding deeper reasoning for complex SQL. On this benchmark, state-of-the-art LLMs (such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1) reach only 4\% execution accuracy when relying on intrinsic reasoning, versus 60\% on MultiSpider 1.0. Therefore, we provide a collaboration-driven language agents baseline that iteratively refines queries, improving accuracy to 15\%. These results reveal a substantial multilingual gap and motivate methods that are robust across languages and ready for real-world enterprise deployment. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/phkhanhtrinh23/Multilingual_Text_to_SQL.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant traction in both computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence for their potential in energy-efficient computing. In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) excel at gradient-based optimization and high accuracy. This contrast has consequently led to a growing subfield of hybrid ANN-SNN research. However, existing hybrid approaches often rely on either a strict separation between ANN and SNN components or employ SNN-only encoders followed by ANN classifiers due to the constraints of non-differentiability of spike encoding functions, causing prior hybrid architectures to lack deep layer-wise cooperation during backpropagation. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid ANN-SNN framework that integrates layer-wise encode-decode SNN blocks within conventional ANN pipelines. Central to our method is the use of surrogate gradients for a bit-plane-based spike encoding function, enabling end-to-end differentiable training across ANN and SNN layers. This design achieves competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art pure ANN and SNN models while retaining the potential efficiency and temporal representation benefits of spiking computation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a surrogate gradient for bit plane coding specifically and spike encoder interface in general to be utilized in the context of hybrid ANN-SNN, successfully leading to a new class of hybrid models that pave new directions for future research.

Abstract: One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However, traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series anomaly detection. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/jk-sounds/ScatterAD.

<title>CLQ: Cross-Layer Guided Orthogonal-based Quantization for Diffusion Transformers</title>

Abstract: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application. Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search. We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our code is available at \hyperlink{https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/CLQ}{https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/CLQ}.

<title>A Data-Centric Perspective on the Influence of Image Data Quality in Machine Learning Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24420</link>

Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development, with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.
  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset, we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training. Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in image-based machine learning.

Abstract: The inherent instability and noise in user interaction data challenge sequential recommendation systems. Prevailing masked attention models, relying on a single query from the most recent item, are sensitive to this noise, reducing prediction reliability. We propose the Multi-Item-Query attention mechanism (MIQ-Attn) to enhance model stability and accuracy. MIQ-Attn constructs multiple diverse query vectors from user interactions, effectively mitigating noise and improving consistency. It is designed for easy adoption as a drop-in replacement for existing single-query attention. Experiments show MIQ-Attn significantly improves performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: The paradigm of Next Token Prediction (NTP) has driven the unprecedented success of Large Language Models (LLMs), but is also the source of their most persistent weaknesses such as poor long-term planning, error accumulation, and computational inefficiency. Acknowledging the growing interest in exploring alternatives to NTP, the survey describes the emerging ecosystem of alternatives to NTP. We categorise these approaches into five main families: (1) Multi-Token Prediction, which targets a block of future tokens instead of a single one; (2) Plan-then-Generate, where a global, high-level plan is created upfront to guide token-level decoding; (3) Latent Reasoning, which shifts the autoregressive process itself into a continuous latent space; (4) Continuous Generation Approaches, which replace sequential generation with iterative, parallel refinement through diffusion, flow matching, or energy-based methods; and (5) Non-Transformer Architectures, which sidestep NTP through their inherent model structure. By synthesizing insights across these methods, this survey offers a taxonomy to guide research into models that address the known limitations of token-level generation to develop new transformative models for natural language processing.

Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary framework for the training of large language models(LLM). The models are divided into several experts(sub-networks), which have the same structure but different parameter values. Only one expert is trained at each step. After the classical AdamW optimization, some evolutionary operators(crossover, PSO, and mutation) act on the tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert. So current expert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert would help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight of the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the same accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the model for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the training needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments show that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times! Our source code is available. It's a pure c++/cu framework, which is suitable for easy deployment on PCs and edge computing devices.

Abstract: The generation of musically coherent and aesthetically pleasing harmony remains a significant challenge in the field of algorithmic composition. This paper introduces an innovative Agentic AI-enabled Higher Harmony Music Generator, a multi-agent system designed to create harmony in a collaborative and modular fashion. Our framework comprises four specialized agents: a Music-Ingestion Agent for parsing and standardizing input musical scores; a Chord-Knowledge Agent, powered by a Chord-Former (Transformer model), to interpret and provide the constituent notes of complex chord symbols; a Harmony-Generation Agent, which utilizes a Harmony-GPT and a Rhythm-Net (RNN) to compose a melodically and rhythmically complementary harmony line; and an Audio-Production Agent that employs a GAN-based Symbolic-to-Audio Synthesizer to render the final symbolic output into high-fidelity audio. By delegating specific tasks to specialized agents, our system effectively mimics the collaborative process of human musicians. This modular, agent-based approach allows for robust data processing, deep theoretical understanding, creative composition, and realistic audio synthesis, culminating in a system capable of generating sophisticated and contextually appropriate higher-voice harmonies for given melodies.

Abstract: This note extends Restrepo (2025)'s model of economic growth under AGI by incorporating Moravec's Paradox -the observation that tasks requiring sensorimotor skills remain computationally expensive relative to cognitive tasks. We partition the task space into cognitive and physical components with differential automation costs, allowing infinite costs for some physical bottlenecks. Our key result shows that when physical tasks constitute economic bottlenecks with sufficiently high (or infinite) computational requirements, the labor share of income converges to a positive constant in the finite-compute regime (rather than zero). This fundamentally alters the distributional implications of AGI while preserving the growth dynamics for cognitive-intensive economies.

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot, inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion attributes according to target Laban tags.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family, inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them, RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

<title>Mitigating Visual Hallucinations via Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization in MLLMs</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics, symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general vision-language benchmarks.

Abstract: The explosive growth of large language models (LLMs) has created a vast but opaque landscape: millions of models exist, yet their evolutionary relationships through fine-tuning, distillation, or adaptation are often undocumented or unclear, complicating LLM management. Existing methods are limited by task specificity, fixed model sets, or strict assumptions about tokenizers or architectures. Inspired by biological DNA, we address these limitations by mathematically defining LLM DNA as a low-dimensional, bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior. We prove that LLM DNA satisfies inheritance and genetic determinism properties and establish the existence of DNA. Building on this theory, we derive a general, scalable, training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. In experiments across 305 LLMs, DNA aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves superior or competitive performance on specific tasks. Beyond these tasks, DNA comparisons uncover previously undocumented relationships among LLMs. We further construct the evolutionary tree of LLMs using phylogenetic algorithms, which align with shifts from encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures, reflect temporal progression, and reveal distinct evolutionary speeds across LLM families.

Abstract: Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task. Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most effective.

Abstract: While LLM-based specification generation is gaining traction, existing tools primarily focus on mainstream programming languages like C, Java, and even Solidity, leaving emerging and yet verification-oriented languages like Move underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MSG, an automated specification generation tool designed for Move smart contracts. MSG aims to highlight key insights that uniquely present when applying LLM-based specification generation to a new ecosystem. Specifically, MSG demonstrates that LLMs exhibit robust code comprehension and generation capabilities even for non-mainstream languages. MSG successfully generates verifiable specifications for 84% of tested Move functions and even identifies clauses previously overlooked by experts. Additionally, MSG shows that explicitly leveraging specification language features through an agentic, modular design improves specification quality substantially (generating 57% more verifiable clauses than conventional designs). Incorporating feedback from the verification toolchain further enhances the effectiveness of MSG, leading to a 30% increase in generated verifiable specifications.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved notable success but often struggle with limited generalizations. To address this, integrating generalized Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as assistants to VLAs has emerged as a popular solution. However, current approaches often combine these models in rigid, sequential structures: using VLMs primarily for high-level scene understanding and task planning, and VLAs merely as executors of lower-level actions, leading to ineffective collaboration and poor grounding challenges. In this paper, we propose an embodied agent framework, PhysiAgent, tailored to operate effectively in physical environments. By incorporating monitor, memory, self-reflection mechanisms, and lightweight off-the-shelf toolboxes, PhysiAgent offers an autonomous scaffolding framework to prompt VLMs to organize different components based on real-time proficiency feedback from VLAs to maximally exploit VLAs' capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in task-solving performance on complex real-world robotic tasks, showcasing effective self-regulation of VLMs, coherent tool collaboration, and adaptive evolution of the framework during execution. PhysiAgent makes practical and pioneering efforts to integrate VLMs and VLAs, effectively grounding embodied agent frameworks in real-world settings.

<title>CMT: Mid-Training for Efficient Learning of Consistency, Mean Flow, and Flow Map Models</title>

Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the (diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training) for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning. Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10, 1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98% less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient, and general framework for training flow map models.

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics, supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Recent works show that hybrid architectures combining sliding window softmax attention layers with linear recurrent neural network (RNN) layers outperform both of these architectures taken separately. However, the impact of the window length and the interplay between softmax attention and linear RNN layers remain under-studied. In this work, we introduce SWAX, a hybrid architecture consisting of sliding-window attention and xLSTM linear RNN layers.
  A counter-intuitive finding with SWAX is that larger sliding windows do not improve the long-context performance. In fact, short window attention encourages the model to better train the long-term memory of the xLSTM, by relying less on the softmax attention mechanism for long context-retrieval.
  The issue with small sliding windows is that they are detrimental for short-context tasks, which could be solved with information from moderately larger sliding windows otherwise. Therefore, we train SWAX by stochastically changing the sliding window size, forcing the model to leverage both a longer context window and the xLSTM memory. SWAX trained with stochastic window sizes significantly outperforms regular window attention both on short and long-context problems.

Abstract: This study showcases an experimental deployment of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) in a circular cylinder at a high Reynolds number (Re = 3000) using rotary actuation. Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number numerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a challenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints such as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state feedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL agent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80% vibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While this level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance achieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is attributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning algorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a high-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex shedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation. These results demonstrate the adaptability of DRL for AFC in real-world experiments and its ability to overcome instrumental limitations such as actuation lag.

Abstract: Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question, leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore, enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers, it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions. On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation. Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking", demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes dynamically.

Abstract: This thesis studies the exploration and exploitation trade-off in online learning of properties of quantum states using multi-armed bandits. Given streaming access to an unknown quantum state, in each round we select an observable from a set of actions to maximize its expectation value. Using past information, we refine actions to minimize regret; the cumulative gap between current reward and the maximum possible. We derive information-theoretic lower bounds and optimal strategies with matching upper bounds, showing regret typically scales as the square root of rounds. As an application, we reframe quantum state tomography to both learn the state efficiently and minimize measurement disturbance. For pure states and continuous actions, we achieve polylogarithmic regret using a sample-optimal algorithm based on a weighted online least squares estimator. The algorithm relies on the optimistic principle and controls the eigenvalues of the design matrix. We also apply our framework to quantum recommender systems and thermodynamic work extraction from unknown states. In this last setting, our results demonstrate an exponential advantage in work dissipation over tomography-based protocols.

Abstract: We present PoseDiff, a conditional diffusion model that unifies robot state estimation and control within a single framework. At its core, PoseDiff maps raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI. The video visualization results can be found on the project page: https://haozhuo-zhang.github.io/PoseDiff-project-page/.

Abstract: We describe algorithms and data structures to extend a neural network library with automatic precision estimation for floating point computations. We also discuss conditions to make estimations exact and preserve high computation performance of neural networks training and inference. Numerical experiments show the consequences of significant precision loss for particular values such as inference, gradients and deviations from mathematically predicted behavior.
  It turns out that almost any neural network accumulates computational inaccuracies. As a result, its behavior does not coincide with predicted by the mathematical model of neural network. This shows that tracking of computational inaccuracies is important for reliability of inference, training and interpretability of results.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on specialized ones.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances, large language models often fail at compositional reasoning tasks, a phenomenon exemplified by the ``curse of two-hop reasoning''. This paper introduces the Identity Bridge, a simple yet powerful mechanism that resolves this compositionality gap by supervising the model on a zero-hop identity task. We demonstrate empirically that this addition enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop reasoning, a task they otherwise completely fail. To explain this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis using a simplified Emb-MLP model, proving that identity supervision reshapes the model's latent geometry. We show this alignment is induced by an implicit nuclear-norm regularization during optimization, which favors low-rank solutions that share structure across tasks. For complex tasks, we use small initialization or weight decay to enhance the regularization effect, which enhances the latent space alignment effect and slows down the generalization decay. Finally, we extend our investigation to large-scale models, observing that they still achieve two-hop reasoning through the latent memory, which provides crucial inspiration for enhancing their implicit reasoning abilities.

Drawing inspiration from the visual cortex, where discrete event processing is interleaved with continuous integration, VNODE alternates between discrete Volterra feature extraction and ODE driven state evolution. This hybrid formulation captures complex patterns while requiring substantially fewer parameters than conventional deep architectures. VNODE consistently outperforms state of the art models with improved computational complexity as exemplified on benchmark datasets like CIFAR10 and Imagenet1K.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly widely used for community detection in attributed networks. They combine structural topology with node attributes through message passing and pooling. However, their robustness or lack of thereof with respect to different perturbations and targeted attacks in conjunction with community detection tasks is not well understood. To shed light into latent mechanisms behind GNN sensitivity on community detection tasks, we conduct a systematic computational evaluation of six widely adopted GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, Graph- SAGE, DiffPool, MinCUT, and DMoN. The analysis covers three perturbation categories: node attribute manipulations, edge topology distortions, and adversarial attacks. We use element-centric similarity as the evaluation metric on synthetic benchmarks and real-world citation networks. Our findings indicate that supervised GNNs tend to achieve higher baseline accuracy, while unsupervised methods, particularly DMoN, maintain stronger resilience under targeted and adversarial pertur- bations. Furthermore, robustness appears to be strongly influenced by community strength, with well-defined communities reducing performance loss. Across all models, node attribute perturba- tions associated with targeted edge deletions and shift in attribute distributions tend to cause the largest degradation in community recovery. These findings highlight important trade-offs between accuracy and robustness in GNN-based community detection and offer new insights into selecting architectures resilient to noise and adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Long-sequence processing is a critical capability for modern large language models. However, the self-attention mechanism in the standard Transformer architecture faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks when processing long sequences. While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising solution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters and disrupt the conventional \textit{pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long} workflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention framework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that seamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2 reuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture modification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence processing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all sequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly transitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical acceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2 that significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on long-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that InfLLM-V2 is 4$\times$ faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and 99.7% of the performance, respectively. Based on the InfLLM-V2 framework, we have trained and open-sourced MiniCPM4.1 (https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B), a hybrid reasoning model, providing a reproducible implementation for the research community.

<title>Understanding the Dilemma of Unlearning for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Unlearning seeks to remove specific knowledge from large language models (LLMs), but its effectiveness remains contested. On one side, "forgotten" knowledge can often be recovered through interventions such as light fine-tuning; on the other side, unlearning may induce catastrophic forgetting that degrades general capabilities. Despite active exploration of unlearning methods, interpretability analyses of the mechanism are scarce due to the difficulty of tracing knowledge in LLMs' complex architectures. We address this gap by proposing unPact, an interpretable framework for unlearning via prompt attribution and contribution tracking. Typically, it quantifies each prompt token's influence on outputs, enabling pre- and post-unlearning comparisons to reveal what changes. Across six mainstream unlearning methods, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we find that: (1) Unlearning appears to be effective by disrupting focus on keywords in prompt; (2) Much of the knowledge is not truly erased and can be recovered by simply emphasizing these keywords in prompts, without modifying the model's weights; (3) Catastrophic forgetting arises from indiscriminate penalization of all tokens. Taken together, our results suggest an unlearning dilemma: existing methods tend either to be insufficient - knowledge remains recoverable by keyword emphasis, or overly destructive - general performance collapses due to catastrophic forgetting, still leaving a gap to reliable unlearning.

Abstract: How reliable are single-response LLM-as-a-judge ratings without references, and can we obtain fine-grained, deterministic scores in this setting? We study the common practice of asking a judge model to assign Likert-scale scores to free-text responses and show two systematic issues: scores are unstable under sampling and poorly calibrated, leading to compression near the top of the scale and frequent ties. We then propose and evaluate Latent Judges, which derive scalar ratings from internal model signals: (i) probability-weighted scores over integer ratings, (ii) verifier-style probabilities of "yes", and (iii) linear probes trained on model activations at the rating position. Across a broad suite of pairwise and single-rating benchmarks, latent methods match or surpass standard prompting, with consistent gains on pairwise accuracy and listwise ranking relevant to Best-of-N selection. Probability-weighted scores achieve the strongest single-rating correlations, while probes recover useful signals when output logits are miscalibrated. These results indicate that latent information provides deterministic and more discriminative signals for reference-free evaluation, and can improve selection and training approaches like Best-of-$N$, multi-teacher distillation, and routing.

Abstract: Geofences have attracted significant attention in the design of spatial and virtual regions for managing and engaging spatiotemporal events. By using geofences to monitor human activity across their boundaries, content providers can create spatially triggered events that include notifications about points of interest within a geofence by pushing spatial information to the devices of users. Traditionally, geofences were hand-crafted by providers. In addition to the hand-crafted approach, recent advances in collecting human mobility data through mobile devices can accelerate the automatic and data-driven design of geofences, also known as the geofence design problem. Previous approaches assume circular shapes; thus, their flexibility is insufficient, and they can only handle geofence-based applications for large areas with coarse resolutions. A challenge with using circular geofences in urban and high-resolution areas is that they often overlap and fail to align with political district boundaries and road segments, such as one-way streets and median barriers. In this study, we address the problem of extracting arbitrary shapes as geofences from human mobility data to mitigate this problem. In our formulation, we cast the existing optimization problems for circular geofences to 0-1 integer programming problems to represent arbitrary shapes. Although 0-1 integer programming problems are computationally hard, formulating them as quadratic (unconstrained) binary optimization problems enables efficient approximation of optimal solutions, because this allows the use of specialized quadratic solvers, such as the quantum annealing, and other state-of-the-art algorithms. We then develop and compare different formulation methods to extract discrete geofences. We confirmed that our new modeling approach enables flexible geofence design.

Abstract: To automatically tune configurations for the best possible system performance (e.g., runtime or throughput), much work has been focused on designing intelligent heuristics in a tuner. However, existing tuner designs have mostly ignored the presence of complex performance requirements (e.g., the latency shall ideally be 2 seconds), but simply assume that better performance is always more preferred. This would not only waste valuable information in a requirement but might also consume extensive resources to tune for a goal with little gain. Yet, prior studies have shown that simply incorporating the requirement as a tuning objective is problematic since the requirement might be too strict, harming convergence; or its highly diverse satisfactions might lead to premature convergence. In this paper, we propose CoTune, a tool that takes the information of a given target performance requirement into account through co-evolution. CoTune is unique in the sense that it creates an auxiliary performance requirement to be co-evolved with the configurations, which assists the target performance requirement when it becomes ineffective or even misleading, hence allowing the tuning to be guided by the requirement while being robust to its harm. Experiment results on 162 cases (nine systems and 18 requirements) reveal that CoTune considerably outperforms existing tuners, ranking as the best for 90% cases (against the 0%--35% for other tuners) with up to 2.9x overall improvements, while doing so under a much better efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration. SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090 GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation, which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover, SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation.

Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) to individual user preferences is a critical step beyond generating generically helpful responses. However, current personalization methods are ill-suited for new users, as they typically require either slow, resource-intensive fine-tuning or a substantial amount of pre-existing user data, creating a significant cold-start problem. To address this challenge, we introduce a new paradigm for real-time personalization by learning from online pairwise preference feedback collected during text generation. We propose T-POP (Test-Time Personalization with Online Preference Feedback}), a novel algorithm that synergistically combines test-time alignment with dueling bandits. Without updating the LLM parameters, T-POP steers the decoding process of a frozen LLM by learning a reward function online that captures user preferences. By leveraging dueling bandits, T-POP intelligently queries the user to efficiently balance between exploring their preferences and exploiting the learned knowledge to generate personalized text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that T-POP achieves rapid and data-efficient personalization, significantly outperforming existing baselines and showing consistent improvement with more user interactions.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the input prompt, making prompt optimization a critical task. However, real-world application is hindered by three major challenges: (1) the black-box nature of powerful proprietary LLMs, (2) the need for high sample efficiency due to query costs, and (3) the desire for privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple users. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel framework for sample-efficient federated prompt optimization based on multi-armed bandits (MABs). The MAB framework is uniquely suited for this problem as it is (1) inherently a black-box optimization method, (2) practically sample-efficient, and (3) enables collaborative learning with theoretically guaranteed benefit from more participating agents. We first propose the Federated Prompt Optimization via Bandits (FedPOB) algorithm, a federated variant of the Linear UCB algorithm, where agents collaborate by sharing model parameters instead of raw data. We then extend our approach to the practical setting of comparative user feedback by introducing FedPOB with Preference Feedback (FedPOB-Pref), an efficient algorithm based on federated dueling bandits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both FedPOB and FedPOB-Pref significantly outperform existing baselines and that their performance consistently improves as more agents participate in the collaboration, validating the effectiveness of our federated approach.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) reward models exhibit systematic failures on longtail distributions, leading to reward hacking and misalignment. We propose a mechanistic interpretability framework that identifies specialized neural circuits responsible for rare-event processing in reward models. Drawing from recent advances showing distributed specialization for rare tokens in language models\citep{liu2025no, liu2025emergent}, we hypothesize that reward models also develop functionally distinct circuits for longtail scenarios. Our theoretical framework establishes formal connections between circuit specialization, reward generalization bounds, and longtail performance. We introduce \textbf{Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART)}, which uses circuit analysis to guide data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble strategies. This approach provides both theoretical insights into reward model failures and practical interventions for improving longtail robustness.

Abstract: Discrete latent bottlenecks in variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer high bit efficiency and can be modeled with autoregressive discrete distributions, enabling parameter-efficient multimodal search with transformers. However, discrete random variables do not allow for exact differentiable parameterization; therefore, discrete VAEs typically rely on approximations, such as Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization or straight-through gradient estimates, or employ high-variance gradient-free methods such as REINFORCE that have had limited success on high-dimensional tasks such as image reconstruction. Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional data from compact latent spaces, achieving a 20% improvement on FID Score for ImageNet 256.

Abstract: Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections remains a challenge in traffic management, especially under partially observed conditions where vehicle flows are not fully captured. This paper introduces Q-Net, a data-efficient and interpretable framework for queue length estimation that performs robustly even when traffic conservation assumptions are violated. Q-Net integrates two widely available and privacy-friendly data sources: (i) vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated floating car data (aFCD), which divides each road section into segments and provides segment-wise average speed measurements. These data sources often differ in spatial and temporal resolution, creating fusion challenges. Q-Net addresses this by employing a tailored state-space model and an AI-augmented Kalman filter, KalmanNet, which learns the Kalman gain from data without requiring prior knowledge of noise covariances or full system dynamics. We build on the vanilla KalmanNet pipeline to decouple measurement dimensionality from section length, enabling spatial transferability across road segments. Unlike black-box models, Q-Net maintains physical interpretability, with internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Evaluations on main roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, demonstrate that Q-Net outperforms baseline methods by over 60\% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accurately tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays. Q-Net also demonstrates strong spatial and temporal transferability, enabling deployment without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar. Additionally, we propose a real-time variant of Q-Net, highlighting its potential for integration into dynamic, queue-based traffic control systems.

<title>A TRIANGLE Enables Multimodal Alignment Beyond Cosine Similarity</title>

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales. Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.

Abstract: Pretraining a policy on offline data followed by fine-tuning through online interactions, known as Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL), has emerged as a promising paradigm for real-world RL deployment. However, both offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed $\textbf{RPEX}$: $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{EX}$pansion. Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios.

<title>Surjective Independence of Causal Influences for Local Bayesian Network Structures</title>

Abstract: The very expressiveness of Bayesian networks can introduce fresh challenges due to the large number of relationships they often model. In many domains, it is thus often essential to supplement any available data with elicited expert judgements. This in turn leads to two key challenges: the cognitive burden of these judgements is often very high, and there are a very large number of judgements required to obtain a full probability model. We can mitigate both issues by introducing assumptions such as independence of causal influences (ICI) on the local structures throughout the network, restricting the parameter space of the model. However, the assumption of ICI is often unjustified and overly strong. In this paper, we introduce the surjective independence of causal influences (SICI) model which relaxes the ICI assumption and provides a more viable, practical alternative local structure model that facilitates efficient Bayesian network parameterisation.

<title>VSSFlow: Unifying Video-conditioned Sound and Speech Generation via Joint Learning</title>

Abstract: Video-conditioned sound and speech generation, encompassing video-to-sound (V2S) and visual text-to-speech (VisualTTS) tasks, are conventionally addressed as separate tasks, with limited exploration to unify them within a signle framework. Recent attempts to unify V2S and VisualTTS face challenges in handling distinct condition types (e.g., heterogeneous video and transcript conditions) and require complex training stages. Unifying these two tasks remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching framework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle distinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer exhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition. Therefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle different representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and self-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary to the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex training strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits from the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation without extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to the learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates convergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the classifier-free guidance process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VSSFlow surpasses the state-of-the-art domain-specific baselines on both V2S and VisualTTS benchmarks, underscoring the critical potential of unified generative models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to ground reasoning in perceptual evidence. We present a systematic study of perception strategies-explicit, implicit, visual, and textual-across four multimodal benchmarks and two MLLMs. Our findings show that explicit perception, especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples perception from reasoning. Stage 1 introduces perception-augmented fine-tuning, and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual, textual, and consistency rewards. Experiments demonstrate that VTPerception-R1 significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks, offering a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Imitation learning benchmarks often lack sufficient variation between training and evaluation, limiting meaningful generalisation assessment. We introduce Labyrinth, a benchmarking environment designed to test generalisation with precise control over structure, start and goal positions, and task complexity. It enables verifiably distinct training, evaluation, and test settings. Labyrinth provides a discrete, fully observable state space and known optimal actions, supporting interpretability and fine-grained evaluation. Its flexible setup allows targeted testing of generalisation factors and includes variants like partial observability, key-and-door tasks, and ice-floor hazards. By enabling controlled, reproducible experiments, Labyrinth advances the evaluation of generalisation in imitation learning and provides a valuable tool for developing more robust agents.

Abstract: Audio pretrained models are widely employed to solve various tasks in speech processing, sound event detection, or music information retrieval. However, the representations learned by these models are unclear, and their analysis mainly restricts to linear probing of the hidden representations. In this work, we explore the use of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze the hidden representations of pretrained models, focusing on a case study in singing technique classification. We first demonstrate that SAEs retain both information about the original representations and class labels, enabling their internal structure to provide insights into self-supervised learning systems. Furthermore, we show that SAEs enhance the disentanglement of vocal attributes, establishing them as an effective tool for identifying the underlying factors encoded in the representations.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale, visually homogeneous datasets can be susceptible to shortcut learning, which impairs their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. While generative data augmentation is a common approach to introduce diversity, it presents a subtle challenge: data composition. Naively mixing real and synthetic data can corrupt the learning signal, as this process often prioritizes visual diversity at the expense of information fidelity. This paper suggests that robust generalization depends on principled, fidelity-aware data composition. We introduce Coherent Information Fidelity Tuning (CIFT), a framework that treats data composition as an optimization problem. CIFT uses a practical proxy for Information Fidelity based on the feature-space geometry of a dataset. This enables the identification of a phase transition, termed the Decoherence Point, where training stability degrades. The framework includes a generative engine, Multi-View Video Augmentation (MVAug), to synthesize a causally disentangled data spectrum for this tuning process. Applying CIFT to policy architectures such as $\pi_0$ and Diffusion Policy improves OOD success rates by over 54\%. These results indicate that fidelity-aware composition, beyond data synthesis alone, is an important component for developing robust, general-purpose robots.

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust, generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and strong identity preservation.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as weather, traffic, electricity, and energy predictions. Currently, common time series forecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches primarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging to capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional methods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require pre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed seasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner, enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function minimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine datasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and achieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets. Notably, it also exhibits stronger generalization capabilities across various transfer scenarios.

Abstract: Extensive monitoring systems generate data that is usually compressed for network transmission. This compressed data might then be processed in the cloud for tasks such as anomaly detection. However, compression can potentially impair the detector's ability to distinguish between regular and irregular patterns due to information loss. Here we extend the information-theoretic framework introduced in [1] to simultaneously address the trade-off between the three features on which the effectiveness of the system depends: the effectiveness of compression, the amount of distortion it introduces, and the distinguishability between compressed normal signals and compressed anomalous signals. We leverage a Gaussian assumption to draw curves showing how moving on a Pareto surface helps administer such a trade-off better than simply relying on optimal rate-distortion compression and hoping that compressed signals can be distinguished from each other.

Abstract: Urban railway systems increasingly rely on communication based train control (CBTC) systems, where optimal deployment of access points (APs) in tunnels is critical for robust wireless coverage. Traditional methods, such as empirical model-based optimization algorithms, are hindered by excessive measurement requirements and suboptimal solutions, while machine learning (ML) approaches often struggle with complex tunnel environments. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) driven framework that integrates parabolic wave equation (PWE) channel modeling, conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) based data augmentation, and a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) for AP placement optimization. The PWE method generates high-fidelity path loss distributions for a subset of AP positions, which are then expanded by the cGAN to create high resolution path loss maps for all candidate positions, significantly reducing simulation costs while maintaining physical accuracy. In the DRL framework, the state space captures AP positions and coverage, the action space defines AP adjustments, and the reward function encourages signal improvement while penalizing deployment costs. The dueling DQN enhances convergence speed and exploration exploitation balance, increasing the likelihood of reaching optimal configurations. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method outperforms a conventional Hooke Jeeves optimizer and traditional DQN, delivering AP configurations with higher average received power, better worst-case coverage, and improved computational efficiency. This work integrates high-fidelity electromagnetic simulation, generative modeling, and AI-driven optimization, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for next-generation CBTC systems in complex tunnel environments.

Abstract: We propose a high-payload image watermarking method for textual embedding, where a semantic description of the image - which may also correspond to the input text prompt-, is embedded inside the image. In order to be able to robustly embed high payloads in large-scale images - such as those produced by modern AI generators - the proposed approach builds upon a traditional watermarking scheme that exploits orthogonal and turbo codes for improved robustness, and integrates frequency-domain embedding and perceptual masking techniques to enhance watermark imperceptibility. Experiments show that the proposed method is extremely robust against a wide variety of image processing, and the embedded text can be retrieved also after traditional and AI inpainting, permitting to unveil the semantic modification the image has undergone via image-text mismatch analysis.

Abstract: SAP has released its own proprietary generative model SAP Joule, intended for various generative tasks, including serving as a code assistant for software engineers. While Joule is yet not focused on SAP-specific ABAP code generation, it can be used for other common languages, including Javascript. This paper compares SAP Joules Javascript coding capabilities against a total of 29 other models using the HumanEval-X Javascript benchmark. SAP Joule achieves a strict accuracy of 80.49% as the fifth best model in our evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comparative evaluation of SAP Joule code generation capabilities.

<title>SemShareKV: Efficient KVCache Sharing for Semantically Similar Prompts via Token-Level LSH Matching</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, the memory footprint of key-value (KV) caches during inference has become a significant bottleneck. Existing approaches primarily focus on compressing KV caches within a single prompt or reusing shared prefixes or frequently ocurred text segments across prompts. However, such strategies are limited in scenarios where prompts are semantically similar but lexically different, which frequently occurs in tasks such as multi-document summarization and conversational agents. We propose \textit{SemShareKV}, a KV cache sharing and compression framework that accelerates LLM inference by reusing KVCache in semantically similar prompts. Instead of relying on exact token matches, SemShareKV applies fuzzy token matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to better preserve positional information. By selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from a reference prompt's cache, SemShareKV reduces redundant computation while maintaining output quality. Experiments on diverse summarization datasets show up to 6.25$\times$ speedup and 42\% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input, with negligible quality degradation. These results highlight the potential of semantic-aware cache sharing for efficient LLM inference.

<title>Hierarchical Error Correction for Large Language Models: A Systematic Framework for Domain-Specific AI Quality Enhancement</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models face significant performance challenges in specialized domains, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 45.9% accuracy on medical coding tasks. This study proposes a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC) framework that addresses domain-specific AI limitations through systematic error analysis and targeted intervention strategies.
  We analyze error patterns across four specialized domains and find that AI errors follow consistent hierarchical structures: Knowledge-layer errors (58.4%), Reasoning-layer errors (39.6%), and Complexity-layer errors (2.0%). Based on these patterns, we develop a three-stage correction framework that addresses errors according to their hierarchical importance and demonstrates that framework effectiveness correlates inversely with baseline task performance.
  Experimental validation across medical transcription (4,921 cases), legal document classification (1,000 cases), political bias detection (645 cases), and legal reasoning (1,000 cases) shows consistent improvements. Cross-model validation across five LLM architectures demonstrates average improvements of 11.2 percentage points (p < 0.001). However, analysis reveals framework limitations in high-baseline tasks (>75% accuracy), where hierarchical intervention may interfere with effective reasoning processes.
  The results suggest that systematic error analysis can guide effective AI enhancement strategies in specialized domains, particularly for moderate-baseline tasks, while highlighting the importance of understanding framework boundaries for optimal deployment.

Abstract: Metaphor is a pervasive feature of discourse and a powerful lens for examining cognition, emotion, and ideology. Large-scale analysis, however, has been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the theory that underpins them.

<title>Retro*: Optimizing LLMs for Reasoning-Intensive Document Retrieval</title>

Abstract: With the growing popularity of LLM agents and RAG, it has become increasingly important to retrieve documents that are essential for solving a task, even when their connection to the task is indirect or implicit. Addressing this problem requires fine-grained reasoning to accurately assess the relevance between the task and each candidate document. This capability, however, poses a significant challenge for existing IR techniques. Despite recent progress in reasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in applicability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose Retro*, a novel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our method introduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to reason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly defined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance score. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning trajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance estimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism, which employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each training sample. Our experiments show that Retro* outperforms existing document retrieval methods with notable advantages, leading to state-of-the-art performance on the BRIGHT benchmark.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential in human-machine collaboration, as human agents tend to adjust their decisions based on the confidence of the machine counterpart. Reliably calibrated model uncertainties, hence, enable more effective collaboration, targeted expert intervention and more responsible usage of Machine Learning (ML) systems. Conformal prediction has become a well established model-agnostic framework for uncertainty calibration of ML models, offering statistically valid confidence estimates for both regression and classification tasks. In this work, we apply conformal prediction to $\textit{SoilNet}$, a multimodal multitask model for describing soil profiles. We design a simulated human-in-the-loop (HIL) annotation pipeline, where a limited budget for obtaining ground truth annotations from domain experts is available when model uncertainty is high. Our experiments show that conformalizing SoilNet leads to more efficient annotation in regression tasks and comparable performance scores in classification tasks under the same annotation budget when tested against its non-conformal counterpart.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and logistics, but severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance on rare categories. We curate a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, and create six balanced variants via SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Lightweight ensembles, such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, and a soft-voting combiner built on MobileNet-V2 features are benchmarked against a configurable ResNet-style CNN trained with strong augmentation and label smoothing. The best ensemble (SMOTE-combined) attains 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieves 79.19% on the full test set and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch, confirming the advantage of deep models. Nonetheless, the most under-represented class (Barge) remains a failure mode, highlighting the limits of rebalancing alone. Results suggest prioritizing additional minority-class collection and cost-sensitive objectives (e.g., focal loss) and exploring hybrid ensemble or CNN pipelines to combine interpretability with representational power.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws underlie many of the recent advances in deep learning, yet their theoretical understanding remains largely confined to linear models. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of scaling laws for quadratic and diagonal neural networks in the feature learning regime. Leveraging connections with matrix compressed sensing and LASSO, we derive a detailed phase diagram for the scaling exponents of the excess risk as a function of sample complexity and weight decay. This analysis uncovers crossovers between distinct scaling regimes and plateau behaviors, mirroring phenomena widely reported in the empirical neural scaling literature. Furthermore, we establish a precise link between these regimes and the spectral properties of the trained network weights, which we characterize in detail. As a consequence, we provide a theoretical validation of recent empirical observations connecting the emergence of power-law tails in the weight spectrum with network generalization performance, yielding an interpretation from first principles.

Abstract: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks, with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench) and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code: https://github.com/biomedia-mira/seg-cft.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents, they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance, and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models, prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust exploratory behavior.

Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models: training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

Abstract: The paradigm shift in large language models (LLMs) from instinctive responses to chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has fueled two prevailing assumptions: (1) reasoning capabilities only emerge in sufficiently large models, and (2) such capabilities require training on massive datasets. While the first assumption has already been challenged by recent sub-billion-parameter reasoning models such as Qwen3-0.6B and DeepSeek distilled variants, the second remains largely unquestioned. In this work, we revisit the necessity of scaling to extremely large corpora (>10T tokens) for reasoning emergence. By carefully curating and resampling open-source datasets that we identify as beneficial under our designed metrics, we demonstrate that strong reasoning abilities can emerge with far less data. Specifically, we show that only ~2T tokens of high-quality data are sufficient, and pre-training with 4.2T tokens on the dataset resampled from these ~2T tokens, followed by a established post-training procedure, enables the development of MobileLLM-R1, a series of sub-billion-parameter reasoning models that substantially outperform prior models trained on fully open-sourced data. For example, MobileLLM-R1-950M achieves an AIME score of 15.5, compared to just 0.6 for OLMo-2-1.48B and 0.3 for SmolLM-2-1.7B. Remarkably, despite being trained on only 11.7% of the tokens compared to Qwen3's proprietary 36T-token corpus for pretraining, MobileLLM-R1-950M matches or surpasses Qwen3-0.6B across multiple reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate further research in this direction, we have released the complete training recipe, data sources, data mixing ratio, and model checkpoints, together with the key insights obtained throughout this study.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving complex sequential decision-making problems by integrating neural networks with the RL framework. However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs. Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage the internal representations learned by the neural network during training. Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Generative robot policies such as Flow Matching offer flexible, multi-modal policy learning but are sample-inefficient. Although object-centric policies improve sample efficiency, it does not resolve this limitation. In this work, we propose Multi-Stream Generative Policy (MSG), an inference-time composition framework that trains multiple object-centric policies and combines them at inference to improve generalization and sample efficiency. MSG is model-agnostic and inference-only, hence widely applicable to various generative policies and training paradigms. We perform extensive experiments both in simulation and on a real robot, demonstrating that our approach learns high-quality generative policies from as few as five demonstrations, resulting in a 95% reduction in demonstrations, and improves policy performance by 89 percent compared to single-stream approaches. Furthermore, we present comprehensive ablation studies on various composition strategies and provide practical recommendations for deployment. Finally, MSG enables zero-shot object instance transfer. We make our code publicly available at https://msg.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a pervasive threat to the security of Large Language Models (LLMs). State-of-the-art prevention-based defenses typically rely on fine-tuning an LLM to enhance its security, but they achieve limited effectiveness against strong attacks. In this work, we propose \emph{SecInfer}, a novel defense against prompt injection attacks built on \emph{inference-time scaling}, an emerging paradigm that boosts LLM capability by allocating more compute resources for reasoning during inference. SecInfer consists of two key steps: \emph{system-prompt-guided sampling}, which generates multiple responses for a given input by exploring diverse reasoning paths through a varied set of system prompts, and \emph{target-task-guided aggregation}, which selects the response most likely to accomplish the intended task. Extensive experiments show that, by leveraging additional compute at inference, SecInfer effectively mitigates both existing and adaptive prompt injection attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art defenses as well as existing inference-time scaling approaches.

<title>Random Policy Valuation is Enough for LLM Reasoning with Verifiable Rewards</title>

Abstract: RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current methods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO, which follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating the current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While effective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse, requiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning. We observe that standard RLVR in math reasoning can be formalized as a specialized finite-horizon Markov Decision Process with deterministic state transitions, tree-structured dynamics, and binary terminal rewards. Though large in scale, the underlying structure is simpler than general-purpose control settings for which popular RL algorithms (e.g., PPO) were developed, suggesting that several sophisticated techniques in existing methods may be reduced or even omitted. Based on this insight, we prove a surprising result: the optimal action can be recovered from the Q-function of a fixed uniformly random policy, thereby bypassing the generalized policy iteration loop and its associated heuristics. We introduce Random Policy Valuation for Diverse Reasoning (ROVER) to translate this principle into a practical and scalable algorithm for LLM math reasoning, a minimalist yet highly effective RL method that samples actions from a softmax over these uniform-policy Q-values. ROVER preserves diversity throughout training, allowing sustained exploration of multiple valid pathways. Across multiple base models and standard math reasoning benchmarks, ROVER demonstrates superior performance in both \textbf{quality} (\textbf{+8.2} on pass@1, \textbf{+16.8} on pass@256) and \textbf{diversity} (\textbf{+17.6\%}), despite its radical simplification compared to strong, complicated existing methods.

Abstract: In user-generated-content (UGC) applications, non-expert users often rely on image-to-3D generative models to create 3D assets. In this context, primitive-based shape abstraction offers a promising solution for UGC scenarios by compressing high-resolution meshes into compact, editable representations. Towards this end, effective shape abstraction must therefore be structure-aware, characterized by low overlap between primitives, part-aware alignment, and primitive compactness. We present Light-SQ, a novel superquadric-based optimization framework that explicitly emphasizes structure-awareness from three aspects. (a) We introduce SDF carving to iteratively udpate the target signed distance field, discouraging overlap between primitives. (b) We propose a block-regrow-fill strategy guided by structure-aware volumetric decomposition, enabling structural partitioning to drive primitive placement. (c) We implement adaptive residual pruning based on SDF update history to surpress over-segmentation and ensure compact results. In addition, Light-SQ supports multiscale fitting, enabling localized refinement to preserve fine geometric details. To evaluate our method, we introduce 3DGen-Prim, a benchmark extending 3DGen-Bench with new metrics for both reconstruction quality and primitive-level editability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Light-SQ enables efficient, high-fidelity, and editable shape abstraction with superquadrics for complex generated geometry, advancing the feasibility of 3D UGC creation.

<title>Generalized Correctness Models: Learning Calibrated and Model-Agnostic Correctness Predictors from Historical Patterns</title>

Abstract: Generating accurate and calibrated confidence estimates is critical for deploying LLMs in high-stakes or user-facing applications, and remains an open challenge. Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting a model's "self-knowledge", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its own answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some privileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the model itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict the correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an unrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a "Correctness Model" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical predictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness information, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that GCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns for correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use CMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its generalization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that answer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore alternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that including history as in-context examples can help improve correctness prediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in calibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families and the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective prediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a generalizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding correctness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on self-introspection.

<title>CLASP: Adaptive Spectral Clustering for Unsupervised Per-Image Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25016</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25016</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.25016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content moderation

<title>AIRoA MoMa Dataset: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset for Mobile Manipulation</title>

Abstract: As robots transition from controlled settings to unstructured human environments, building generalist agents that can reliably follow natural language instructions remains a central challenge. Progress in robust mobile manipulation requires large-scale multimodal datasets that capture contact-rich and long-horizon tasks, yet existing resources lack synchronized force-torque sensing, hierarchical annotations, and explicit failure cases. We address this gap with the AIRoA MoMa Dataset, a large-scale real-world multimodal dataset for mobile manipulation. It includes synchronized RGB images, joint states, six-axis wrist force-torque signals, and internal robot states, together with a novel two-layer annotation schema of sub-goals and primitive actions for hierarchical learning and error analysis. The initial dataset comprises 25,469 episodes (approx. 94 hours) collected with the Human Support Robot (HSR) and is fully standardized in the LeRobot v2.1 format. By uniquely integrating mobile manipulation, contact-rich interaction, and long-horizon structure, AIRoA MoMa provides a critical benchmark for advancing the next generation of Vision-Language-Action models. The first version of our dataset is now available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/airoa-org/airoa-moma .

Abstract: Fast generation of language texts is the holy grail that people pursue in the AI era. In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct (DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation models by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language model (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM counterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical part of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of integral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We also introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly improve the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference performances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated language generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard dLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128 NFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss of about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye. We will release both code and models at github.com/haoyangzheng-ai/didi-instruct.

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time pipeline for dynamic arm gesture recognition based on OpenPose keypoint estimation, keypoint normalization, and a recurrent neural network classifier. The 1 x 1 normalization scheme and two feature representations (coordinate- and angle-based) are presented for the pipeline. In addition, an efficient method to improve robustness against camera angle variations is also introduced by using artificially rotated training data. Experiments on a custom traffic-control gesture dataset demonstrate high accuracy across varying viewing angles and speeds. Finally, an approach to calculate the speed of the arm signal (if necessary) is also presented.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are starting to be profiled as one of the most significant disruptions in the Software Testing field.
  Specifically, they have been successfully applied in software testing tasks such as generating test code, or summarizing documentation.
  This potential has attracted hundreds of researchers, resulting in dozens of new contributions every month, hardening researchers to
  stay at the forefront of the wave. Still, to the best of our knowledge, no prior work has provided a structured vision of the progress
  and most relevant research trends in LLM-based testing. In this article, we aim to provide a roadmap that illustrates its current state,
  grouping the contributions into different categories, and also sketching the most promising and active research directions for the field.
  To achieve this objective, we have conducted a semi-systematic literature review, collecting articles and mapping them into the most
  prominent categories, reviewing the current and ongoing status, and analyzing the open challenges of LLM-based software testing.
  Lastly, we have outlined several expected long-term impacts of LLMs over the whole software testing field.

<title>Hyperdimensional Probe: Decoding LLM Representations via Vector Symbolic Architectures</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25045</link>

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with limited understanding of their internal representations. Current interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative, interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving technologies have introduced a paradigm shift that allows for realizable secure computing in real-world systems. The significant barrier to the practical adoption of these primitives is the computational and communication overhead that is incurred when applied at scale. In this paper, we present an overview of our efforts to bridge the gap between this overhead and practicality for privacy-preserving learning systems using multi-party computation (MPC), zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Through meticulous hardware/software/algorithm co-design, we show progress towards enabling LLM-scale applications in privacy-preserving settings. We demonstrate the efficacy of our solutions in several contexts, including DNN IP ownership, ethical LLM usage enforcement, and transformer inference.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a foundational task for computer vision. Traditional methods are limited by data scarcity and quality, hindering their robustness. To overcome this, we propose BRIDGE, an RL-optimized depth-to-image (D2I) generation framework that synthesizes over 20M realistic and geometrically accurate RGB images, each intrinsically paired with its ground truth depth, from diverse source depth maps. Then we train our depth estimation model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust training. This innovative data generation and training paradigm enables BRIDGE to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in complex scene detail capture, thereby fostering general and robust depth features. Code and models are available at https://dingning-liu.github.io/bridge.github.io/.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost. In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation -- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation, we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets, UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image, achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality.

Abstract: Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific discovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however, rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic tasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with an average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming the strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B also performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also incorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the analysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic training for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B for the community's future research.

Abstract: jina-reranker-v3 is a 0.6B parameter multilingual document reranker that introduces a novel last but not late interaction. Unlike late interaction models such as ColBERT that perform separate encoding followed by multi-vector matching, our approach conducts causal self-attention between query and documents within the same context window, enabling rich cross-document interactions before extracting contextual embeddings from the last token of each document. This compact architecture achieves state-of-the-art BEIR performance with 61.94 nDCG@10 while being ten times smaller than generative listwise rerankers.

<title>Scaling with Collapse: Efficient and Predictable Training of LLM Families</title>

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities -- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*, where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget, in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

It employs an Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization objective that contrasts teacher and student traces for more effective learning, and adopts a mixed-policy strategy for utilizing student-generated outputs, outperforming both off- and on-policy alternatives. Experiments on five datasets and multiple student models show consistent improvements over conventional black-box KD baselines.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) can autonomously conduct complex investigations and generate comprehensive reports, demonstrating strong real-world potential. However, existing evaluations mostly rely on close-ended benchmarks, while open-ended deep research benchmarks remain scarce and typically neglect personalized scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Personalized Deep Research Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating personalization in DRAs. It pairs 50 diverse research tasks across 10 domains with 25 authentic user profiles that combine structured persona attributes with dynamic real-world contexts, yielding 250 realistic user-task queries. To assess system performance, we propose the PQR Evaluation Framework, which jointly measures (P) Personalization Alignment, (Q) Content Quality, and (R) Factual Reliability. Our experiments on a range of systems highlight current capabilities and limitations in handling personalized deep research. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for developing and evaluating the next generation of truly personalized AI research assistants.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one- or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations. Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings, without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly available.

arXiv:2509.25131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MGM-Omni, a unified Omni LLM for omni-modal understanding and expressive, long-horizon speech generation. Unlike cascaded pipelines that isolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a "brain-mouth" design with a dual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal reasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient cross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For understanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder design enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions. For generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech token-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice cloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent work, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing open source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences, producing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form audio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient, end-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalised long-horizon speech generation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great promise in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence. Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.

<title>Paired by the Teacher: Turning Unpaired Data into High-Fidelity Pairs for Low-Resource Text Generation</title>

Abstract: We present Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a two-stage teacher-student pipeline that synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel data. In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios, practitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions, or only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom both. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely on costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses this by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise intermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs from IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs, yielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five benchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization (SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired setting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained only on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora and other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated pairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of direct synthesis. Human evaluation on SwitchBoard further confirms that only PbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with the target style, highlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the mismatch, limiting direct synthesis.

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and 440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation, semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform), across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments (indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors (resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at 25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

<title>Pretraining Large Language Models with NVFP4</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) today are powerful problem solvers across many domains, and they continue to get stronger as they scale in model size, training set size, and training set quality, as shown by extensive research and experimentation across the industry. Training a frontier model today requires on the order of tens to hundreds of yottaflops, which is a massive investment of time, compute, and energy. Improving pretraining efficiency is therefore essential to enable the next generation of even more capable LLMs. While 8-bit floating point (FP8) training is now widely adopted, transitioning to even narrower precision, such as 4-bit floating point (FP4), could unlock additional improvements in computational speed and resource utilization. However, quantization at this level poses challenges to training stability, convergence, and implementation, notably for large-scale models trained on long token horizons.
  In this study, we introduce a novel approach for stable and accurate training of large language models (LLMs) using the NVFP4 format. Our method integrates Random Hadamard transforms (RHT) to bound block-level outliers, employs a two-dimensional quantization scheme for consistent representations across both the forward and backward passes, utilizes stochastic rounding for unbiased gradient estimation, and incorporates selective high-precision layers. We validate our approach by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion tokens -- the longest publicly documented training run in 4-bit precision to date. Our results show that the model trained with our NVFP4-based pretraining technique achieves training loss and downstream task accuracies comparable to an FP8 baseline. These findings highlight that NVFP4, when combined with our training approach, represents a major step forward in narrow-precision LLM training algorithms.

Abstract: Generative models excel at synthesizing high-fidelity samples from complex data distributions, but they often violate hard constraints arising from physical laws or task specifications. A common remedy is to project intermediate samples onto the feasible set; however, repeated projection can distort the learned distribution and induce a mismatch with the data manifold. Thus, recent multi-stage procedures attempt to defer projection to clean samples during sampling, but they increase algorithmic complexity and accumulate errors across steps. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel training-free method, Chance-constrained Flow Matching (CCFM), that integrates stochastic optimization into the sampling process, enabling effective enforcement of hard constraints while maintaining high-fidelity sample generation. Importantly, CCFM guarantees feasibility in the same manner as conventional repeated projection, yet, despite operating directly on noisy intermediate samples, it is theoretically equivalent to projecting onto the feasible set defined by clean samples. This yields a sampler that mitigates distributional distortion. Empirical experiments show that CCFM outperforms current state-of-the-art constrained generative models in modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations and molecular docking problems, delivering higher feasibility and fidelity.

<title>GSM8K-V: Can Vision Language Models Solve Grade School Math Word Problems in Visual Contexts</title>

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text, enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception, planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently, numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation, we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement. GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and generalizable VLMs.

Abstract: The performance of flow matching and diffusion models can be greatly improved at inference time using reward alignment algorithms, yet efficiency remains a major limitation. While several algorithms were proposed, we demonstrate that a common bottleneck is the sampling method these algorithms rely on: many algorithms require to sample Markov transitions via SDE sampling, which is significantly less efficient and often less performant than ODE sampling. To remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that simulates a "flow matching model within a flow matching model" to sample Markov transitions. As we show in this work, this "inner" flow matching model can be retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between stochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS Flows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making it a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion models.

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a central property of effective deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Recent work has improved this through added complexity, such as larger models, exotic network architectures, and more complex algorithms, which are typically motivated purely by empirical performance. We take a more principled approach by focusing on the optimization landscape of the critic network. Using the eigenspectrum and condition number of the critic's Hessian, we systematically investigate the impact of common architectural design decisions on training dynamics. Our analysis reveals that a novel combination of batch normalization (BN), weight normalization (WN), and a distributional cross-entropy (CE) loss produces condition numbers orders of magnitude smaller than baselines. This combination also naturally bounds gradient norms, a property critical for maintaining a stable effective learning rate under non-stationary targets and bootstrapping. Based on these insights, we introduce XQC: a well-motivated, sample-efficient deep actor-critic algorithm built upon soft actor-critic that embodies these optimization-aware principles. We achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency across 55 proprioception and 15 vision-based continuous control tasks, all while using significantly fewer parameters than competing methods.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) steering has emerged as a promising paradigm for controlling model behavior at inference time through targeted manipulation of hidden states, offering a lightweight alternative to expensive retraining. However, existing steering frameworks suffer from critical limitations: computational inefficiency, limited extensibility, and restricted functionality that hinder both research progress and practical deployment. We present EasySteer, a unified framework for high-performance, extensible LLM steering built on vLLM. Our system features modular architecture with pluggable interfaces for both analysis-based and learning-based methods, fine-grained parameter control, pre-computed steering vectors for eight application domains, and an interactive demonstration system. Through deep integration with vLLM's optimized inference engine, EasySteer achieves 5.5-11.4$\times$ speedup over existing frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in overthinking mitigation, hallucination reduction, and other key applications. EasySteer transforms steering from research technique to production-ready capability, establishing critical infrastructure for deployable, controllable language models.

<title>GHOST: Hallucination-Inducing Image Generation for Multimodal LLMs</title>

Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

Abstract: The ability to estimate the quality of scientific papers is central to how both humans and AI systems will advance scientific knowledge in the future. However, existing LLM-based estimation methods suffer from high inference cost, whereas the faster direct score regression approach is limited by scale inconsistencies. We present NAIPv2, a debiased and efficient framework for paper quality estimation. NAIPv2 employs pairwise learning within domain-year groups to reduce inconsistencies in reviewer ratings and introduces the Review Tendency Signal (RTS) as a probabilistic integration of reviewer scores and confidences. To support training and evaluation, we further construct NAIDv2, a large-scale dataset of 24,276 ICLR submissions enriched with metadata and detailed structured content. Trained on pairwise comparisons but enabling efficient pointwise prediction at deployment, NAIPv2 achieves state-of-the-art performance (78.2% AUC, 0.432 Spearman), while maintaining scalable, linear-time efficiency at inference. Notably, on unseen NeurIPS submissions, it further demonstrates strong generalization, with predicted scores increasing consistently across decision categories from Rejected to Oral. These findings establish NAIPv2 as a debiased and scalable framework for automated paper quality estimation, marking a step toward future scientific intelligence systems. Code and dataset are released at https://sway.cloud.microsoft/Pr42npP80MfPhvj8.

<title>DC-Gen: Post-Training Diffusion Acceleration with Deeply Compressed Latent Space</title>

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup. Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a 4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model.

Abstract: We introduce DC-VideoGen, a post-training acceleration framework for efficient video generation. DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video diffusion model, improving efficiency by adapting it to a deep compression latent space with lightweight fine-tuning. The framework builds on two key innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii) AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100 GPU. The accelerated models achieve up to 14.8x lower inference latency than their base counterparts without compromising quality, and further enable 2160x3840 video generation on a single GPU.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in modern search and answer systems to synthesize multiple, sometimes conflicting, texts into a single response, yet current pipelines offer weak incentives for sources to be accurate and are vulnerable to adversarial content. We introduce Truthful Text Summarization (TTS), an incentive-aligned framework that improves factual robustness without ground-truth labels. TTS (i) decomposes a draft synthesis into atomic claims, (ii) elicits each source's stance on every claim, (iii) scores sources with an adapted multi-task peer-prediction mechanism that rewards informative agreement, and (iv) filters unreliable sources before re-summarizing. We establish formal guarantees that align a source's incentives with informative honesty, making truthful reporting the utility-maximizing strategy. Experiments show that TTS improves factual accuracy and robustness while preserving fluency, aligning exposure with informative corroboration and disincentivizing manipulation.

Abstract: The inverse design of materials with specific desired properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, represents a formidable challenge in materials science due to the vastness of chemical and structural space. We present a guided diffusion framework to accelerate the discovery of novel superconductors. A DiffCSP foundation model is pretrained on the Alexandria Database and fine-tuned on 7,183 superconductors with first principles derived labels. Employing classifier-free guidance, we sample 200,000 structures, which lead to 34,027 unique candidates. A multistage screening process that combines machine learning and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess stability and electronic properties, identifies 773 candidates with DFT-calculated $T_\mathrm{c}>5$ K. Notably, our generative model demonstrates effective property-driven design. Our computational findings were validated against experimental synthesis and characterization performed as part of this work, which highlighted challenges in sparsely charted chemistries. This end-to-end workflow accelerates superconductor discovery while underscoring the challenge of predicting and synthesizing experimentally realizable materials.

Abstract: Building Large Language Model agents that expand their capabilities by interacting with external tools represents a new frontier in AI research and applications. In this paper, we introduce InfoAgent, a deep research agent powered by an innovative data synthesis pipeline and orchestrated web search tools. To construct challenging, hard-to-find queries,we build entity trees and apply sub-tree sampling with entity fuzzification to systematically increase question difficulty. Unlike prior work that relies heavily on commercial search tools, we develop a dedicated self-hosted search infrastructure, enhancing transparency of agent environments and facilitating further advancement of agent capacity. We evaluate the effectiveness of our data pipeline by measuring the average number of tool calls required to correctly answer a question, and also show that our agent yields better performance when equipped with our tools. Our \mbox{InfoAgent} is post-trained from Qwen3-14B using a two-stage recipe: cold-start supervised finetuning to instill long-horizon search behaviors, followed by reinforcement learning which significantly improves reasoning-driven tool use. With our methods, InfoAgent achieves 15.3\% accuracy on BrowseComp, 29.2\% on BrowseComp-ZH, and 40.4\% on Xbench-DS, outperforming prior open-source deep research agents such as WebSailor-72B and DeepDive-32B.

Abstract: Complex Query Answering (CQA) is a challenge task of Knowledge Graph (KG). Due to the incompleteness of KGs, query embedding (QE) methods have been proposed to encode queries and entities into the same embedding space, and treat logical operators as neural set operators to obtain answers. However, these methods train KG embeddings and neural set operators concurrently on both simple (one-hop) and complex (multi-hop and logical) queries, which causes performance degradation on simple queries and low training efficiency. In this paper, we propose Query to Triple (Q2T), a novel approach that decouples the training for simple and complex queries. Q2T divides the training into two stages: (1) Pre-training a neural link predictor on simple queries to predict tail entities based on the head entity and relation. (2) Training a query encoder on complex queries to encode diverse complex queries into a unified triple form that can be efficiently solved by the pretrained neural link predictor. Our proposed Q2T is not only efficient to train, but also modular, thus easily adaptable to various neural link predictors that have been studied well. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, even without explicit modeling for neural set operators, Q2T still achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse complex queries over three public benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper provides policy recommendations to reduce extinction risks from advanced artificial intelligence (AI). First, we briefly provide background information about extinction risks from AI. Second, we argue that voluntary commitments from AI companies would be an inappropriate and insufficient response. Third, we describe three policy proposals that would meaningfully address the threats from advanced AI: (1) establishing a Multinational AGI Consortium to enable democratic oversight of advanced AI (MAGIC), (2) implementing a global cap on the amount of computing power used to train an AI system (global compute cap), and (3) requiring affirmative safety evaluations to ensure that risks are kept below acceptable levels (gating critical experiments). MAGIC would be a secure, safety-focused, internationally-governed institution responsible for reducing risks from advanced AI and performing research to safely harness the benefits of AI. MAGIC would also maintain emergency response infrastructure (kill switch) to swiftly halt AI development or withdraw model deployment in the event of an AI-related emergency. The global compute cap would end the corporate race toward dangerous AI systems while enabling the vast majority of AI innovation to continue unimpeded. Gating critical experiments would ensure that companies developing powerful AI systems are required to present affirmative evidence that these models keep extinction risks below an acceptable threshold. After describing these recommendations, we propose intermediate steps that the international community could take to implement these proposals and lay the groundwork for international coordination around advanced AI.

Abstract: Providing well-calibrated AI confidence can help promote users' appropriate trust in and reliance on AI, which are essential for AI-assisted decision-making. However, calibrating AI confidence -- providing confidence score that accurately reflects the true likelihood of AI being correct -- is known to be challenging. To understand the effects of AI confidence miscalibration, we conducted our first experiment. The results indicate that miscalibrated AI confidence impairs users' appropriate reliance and reduces AI-assisted decision-making efficacy, and AI miscalibration is difficult for users to detect. Then, in our second experiment, we examined whether communicating AI confidence calibration levels could mitigate the above issues. We find that it helps users to detect AI miscalibration. Nevertheless, since such communication decreases users' trust in uncalibrated AI, leading to high under-reliance, it does not improve the decision efficacy. We discuss design implications based on these findings and future directions to address risks and ethical concerns associated with AI miscalibration.

Abstract: Grounding the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) for embodied tasks is challenging due to the complexity of the physical world. Especially, LLM planning for multi-agent collaboration requires communication of agents or credit assignment as the feedback to re-adjust the proposed plans and achieve effective coordination. However, existing methods that overly rely on physical verification or self-reflection suffer from excessive and inefficient querying of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-agent collaboration that introduces Reinforced Advantage feedback (ReAd) for efficient self-refinement of plans. Specifically, we perform critic regression to learn a sequential advantage function from LLM-planned data, and then treat the LLM planner as an optimizer to generate actions that maximize the advantage function. It endows the LLM with the foresight to discern whether the action contributes to accomplishing the final task. We provide theoretical analysis by extending advantage-weighted regression in reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems. Experiments on Overcooked-AI and a difficult variant of RoCoBench show that ReAd surpasses baselines in success rate, and also significantly decreases the interaction steps of agents and query rounds of LLMs, demonstrating its high efficiency for grounding LLMs. More results are given at https://embodied-read.github.io

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on reasoning tasks, including mathematical reasoning. However, the current evaluation mostly focuses on carefully constructed benchmarks and neglects the consideration of real-world reasoning problems that present missing or contradictory conditions, known as ill-defined problems. To further study this problem, we develop a largescale benchmark called Problems with Missing and Contradictory conditions (PMC) containing over 5,000 validated ill-defined mathematical problems. Our preliminary experiments through PMC reveal two challenges about existing methods: (1) traditional methods exhibit a trade-off between solving accuracy and rejection capabilities, and (2) formal methods struggle with modeling complex problems. To address these challenges, We develop Variable-Constraint Search (VCSEARCH), a trainingfree framework that leverages formal language to detect ill-defined problems, where a variableconstraint pair search strategy is incorporated to improve the modeling capability of formal language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VCSEARCH improves the accuracy of identifying unsolvable problems by at least 12% across different LLMs, thus achieving stronger robust mathematical reasoning ability.

Abstract: Recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have substantially improved question-answering systems, particularly for factoid '5Ws' questions. However, significant challenges remain when addressing '1H' questions, specifically how-to questions, which are integral for decision-making and require dynamic, step-by-step responses. The key limitation lies in the prevalent data organization paradigm, chunk, which commonly divides documents into fixed-size segments, and disrupts the logical coherence and connections within the context. To address this, we propose Thread, a novel data organization paradigm enabling systems to handle how-to questions more effectively. Specifically, we introduce a new knowledge granularity, 'logic unit' (LU), where large language models transform documents into more structured and loosely interconnected LUs. Extensive experiments across both open-domain and industrial settings show that Thread outperforms existing paradigms significantly, improving the success rate of handling how-to questions by 21% to 33%. Additionally, Thread demonstrates high adaptability across diverse document formats, reducing retrieval information by up to 75% compared to chunk, and also shows better generalizability to '5Ws' questions, such as multi-hop questions, outperforming other paradigms.

In this system, LLM checkers vote on the acceptability of a generated output, regenerating it if a threshold of disapproval is reached, until sufficient checkers approve. Based on our estimators for cost and failure rate and experimental data tailored to the application, our algorithm achieves a desired expected failure rate at Pareto-optimal cost. The failure rate provably decreases exponentially as a function of cost, and the models reasonably estimate the actual performance of such a system in action, even with limited data. This approach does not depend on the language model used, and could allow cheap, small LLMs to control, constrain, or at some tasks even outperform very complex and costly ones.

Abstract: Current methods to learn controllers for autonomous vehicles (AVs) focus on behavioural cloning. Being trained only on exact historic data, the resulting agents often generalize poorly to novel scenarios. Simulators provide the opportunity to go beyond offline datasets, but they are still treated as complicated black boxes, only used to update the global simulation state. As a result, these RL algorithms are slow, sample-inefficient, and prior-agnostic. In this work, we leverage a differentiable simulator and design an analytic policy gradients (APG) approach to training AV controllers on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Our proposed framework brings the differentiable simulator into an end-to-end training loop, where gradients of the environment dynamics serve as a useful prior to help the agent learn a more grounded policy. We combine this setup with a recurrent architecture that can efficiently propagate temporal information across long simulated trajectories. This APG method allows us to learn robust, accurate, and fast policies, while only requiring widely-available expert trajectories, instead of scarce expert actions. We compare to behavioural cloning and find significant improvements in performance and robustness to noise in the dynamics, as well as overall more intuitive human-like handling.

Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) aims to merge two knowledge graphs (KGs) by identifying equivalent entity pairs. Existing methods can be categorized into symbolic and neural models. Symbolic models, while precise, struggle with substructure heterogeneity and sparsity, whereas neural models, although effective, generally lack interpretability and cannot handle uncertainty. We propose NeuSymEA, a unified neuro-symbolic reasoning framework that combines the strengths of both methods to fully exploit the cross-KG structural pattern for robust entity alignment. NeuSymEA models the joint probability of all possible pairs' truth scores in a Markov random field, regulated by a set of rules, and optimizes it with the variational EM algorithm. In the E-step, a neural model parameterizes the truth score distributions and infers missing alignments. In the M-step, the rule weights are updated based on the observed and inferred alignments, handling uncertainty. We introduce an efficient symbolic inference engine driven by logic deduction, enabling reasoning with extended rule lengths. NeuSymEA achieves a significant 7.6\% hit@1 improvement on $\text{DBP15K}_{\text{ZH-EN}}$ compared with strong baselines and demonstrates robustness in low-resource settings, achieving 73.7\% hit@1 accuracy on $\text{DBP15K}_{\text{FR-EN}}$ with only 1\% pairs as seed alignments. Codes are released at https://github.com/chensyCN/NeuSymEA-NeurIPS25.

Abstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) present significant challenges to artificial intelligence due to their intricate constraints and the necessity for precise solutions. Existing symbolic solvers are often slow, and prior research has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) alone struggle with CSPs because of their complexity. To bridge this gap, we build upon the existing SOFAI architecture (SOFAI_v1), which adapts Daniel Kahneman's ''Thinking, Fast and Slow'' cognitive model to AI. Our enhanced architecture, SOFAI_v2, integrates refined metacognitive governance mechanisms to improve adaptability across complex domains, specifically tailored here for solving the graph coloring problem, a specific type of CSP. SOFAI_v2 combines a fast System 1 (S1), leveraging LLMs, with a deliberative System 2 (S2), governed by a metacognition module. S1's initial solutions, often limited by constraint adherence issues, are improved through targeted feedback and examples from metacognition, aligning S1 more closely with CSP requirements. If S1 fails to resolve the problem, metacognition strategically invokes S2, ensuring accurate and reliable solutions. Our empirical results demonstrate that SOFAI_v2 achieves a 10.5% higher success rate and is up to 30% faster than a traditional symbolic solver in solving graph coloring problems.

Abstract: In response to the call for agent-based solutions that leverage the ever-increasing capabilities of the deep models' ecosystem, we introduce Hive -- a comprehensive solution for knowledge-aware planning of a set of atomic actions to address input queries and subsequently selecting appropriate models accordingly. Hive operates over sets of models and, upon receiving natural language instructions (i.e. user queries), schedules and executes explainable plans of atomic actions. These actions can involve one or more of the available models to achieve the overall task, while respecting end-users specific constraints. Notably, Hive handles tasks that involve multi-modal inputs and outputs, enabling it to handle complex, real-world queries. Our system is capable of planning complex chains of actions while guaranteeing explainability, using an LLM-based formal logic backbone empowered by PDDL operations. We introduce the MuSE benchmark in order to offer a comprehensive evaluation of the multi-modal capabilities of agent systems. Our findings show that our framework redefines the state-of-the-art for task selection, outperforming other competing systems that plan operations across multiple models while offering transparency guarantees while fully adhering to user constraints.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents, powered by Large Foundation Models, have emerged as a transformative approach to automating human-computer interaction. These agents autonomously interact with digital systems or software applications via GUIs, emulating human actions such as clicking, typing, and navigating visual elements across diverse platforms. Motivated by the growing interest and fundamental importance of GUI agents, we provide a comprehensive survey that categorizes their benchmarks, evaluation metrics, architectures, and training methods. We propose a unified framework that delineates their perception, reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities. Furthermore, we identify important open challenges and discuss key future directions. Finally, this work serves as a basis for practitioners and researchers to gain an intuitive understanding of current progress, techniques, benchmarks, and critical open problems that remain to be addressed.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have sparked growing interest in developing LM agents. While fully autonomous agents could excel in many scenarios, numerous use cases inherently require them to collaborate with humans due to humans' latent preferences, domain expertise, or need for control. To facilitate the study of human-agent collaboration, we present Collaborative Gym (Co-Gym), a general framework enabling asynchronous, tripartite interaction among agents, humans, and task environments. We instantiate Co-Gym with three representative tasks in both simulated and real-world conditions, and propose an evaluation framework that assesses both the collaboration outcomes and processes. Our findings reveal that collaborative agents consistently outperform their fully autonomous counterparts in task performance within those delivered cases, achieving win rates of 86% in Travel Planning, 74% in Tabular Analysis, and 66% in Related Work when evaluated by real users. However, our study also highlights significant challenges in developing collaborative agents, requiring advancements in core aspects of intelligence -- communication capabilities, situational awareness, and balancing autonomy and human control.

Abstract: Our aim in this paper is to outline how the design space for the ontologization process is broader than current practice would suggest. We point out that engineering processes as well as products need to be designed and identify some components of the design. We investigate the possibility of designing a range of radically new practices implemented as data pipelines, providing examples of the new practices from our work over the last three decades with an outlier methodology, bCLEARer. We also suggest that setting an evolutionary context for ontologization helps one to better understand the nature of these new practices and provides the conceptual scaffolding that shapes fertile processes. Where this evolutionary perspective positions digitalization (the evolutionary emergence of computing technologies) as the latest step in a long evolutionary trail of information transitions. This reframes ontologization as a strategic tool for leveraging the emerging opportunities offered by digitalization.

Abstract: In the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), automating the generation and evaluation of novel research ideas is a key challenge in AI-driven scientific discovery. This paper presents Relative Neighbor Density (RND), a domain-agnostic algorithm for novelty assessment in research ideas that overcomes the limitations of existing approaches by comparing an idea's local density with its adjacent neighbors' densities. We first developed a scalable methodology to create test set without expert labeling, addressing a fundamental challenge in novelty assessment. Using these test sets, we demonstrate that our RND algorithm achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in computer science (AUROC=0.820) and biomedical research (AUROC=0.765) domains. Most significantly, while SOTA models like Sonnet-3.7 and existing metrics show domain-specific performance degradation, RND maintains consistent accuracies across domains by its domain-invariant property, outperforming all benchmarks by a substantial margin (0.795 v.s. 0.597) on cross-domain evaluation. These results validate RND as a generalizable solution for automated novelty assessment in scientific research.

Abstract: Human reasoning relies on constructing and manipulating mental models -- simplified internal representations of situations used to understand and solve problems. Conceptual diagrams (e.g., a sketch drawn to aid reasoning) externalize these mental models, abstracting irrelevant details to efficiently capture how entities interact. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large MultiModal Models (LMMs) predominantly reason through text, limiting their effectiveness on complex multi-step tasks. In this paper, we propose Visual Thinking, a generalizable framework that enables LMMs to reason through multiple chains of self-generated conceptual diagrams, significantly enhancing their combinatorial planning capabilities. Our approach requires no human input beyond the natural language description of the task. It integrates textual and diagrammatic reasoning within an optimized Graph-of-Thought inference framework, enhanced by beam search and depth-wise backtracking. Evaluated on multiple challenging PDDL planning domains, our method substantially improves LMM performance (e.g., GPT-4o: 35.5% -> 90.2% in Blocksworld) and consistently outperforms text-only search-based inference methods. On more difficult domains with solution depths up to 40, it also surpasses the o1-preview reasoning model (e.g., 16 percentage points improvement in Floor Tiles). These results demonstrate the power of conceptual diagrams as a reasoning medium in LMMs.

<title>Safety Mirage: How Spurious Correlations Undermine VLM Safety Fine-Tuning and Can Be Mitigated by Machine Unlearning</title>

Abstract: Recent vision language models (VLMs) have made remarkable strides in generative modeling with multimodal inputs, particularly text and images. However, their susceptibility to generating harmful content when exposed to unsafe queries raises critical safety concerns. While current alignment strategies primarily rely on supervised safety fine-tuning with curated datasets, we identify a fundamental limitation we call the ''safety mirage'', where supervised fine-tuning inadvertently reinforces spurious correlations between superficial textual patterns and safety responses, rather than fostering deep, intrinsic mitigation of harm. We show that these spurious correlations leave fine-tuned VLMs vulnerable even to a simple one-word modification-based attack, where substituting a single word in text queries with a spurious correlation-inducing alternative can effectively bypass safeguards. Additionally, these correlations contribute to the over-prudence, causing fine-tuned VLMs to refuse benign queries unnecessarily. To address these issues, we show machine unlearning (MU) as a powerful alternative to supervised safety fine-tuning, as it avoids biased feature-label mappings and directly removes harmful knowledge from VLMs while preserving their general capabilities. Extensive evaluations across safety benchmarks show that under MU-based alignment reduces the attack success rate by up to 60.17% and cuts unnecessary rejections by over 84.20%. WARNING: There exist AI generations that may be offensive in nature.

<title>Do Larger Language Models Generalize Better? A Scaling Law for Implicit Reasoning at Pretraining Time</title>

Abstract: Reasoning is an integral part of many tasks performed by language models (LMs). However, the effects of scaling model sizes and data on reasoning abilities at pretraining time remain understudied. To rigorously investigate this problem, we pretrain LMs from scratch on a synthetic implicit multihop reasoning environment designed to closely replicate the structure and distribution of real-world large-scale knowledge graphs. We then assess the LMs' ability to complete the missing edges in the graph, which requires multi-hop reasoning that can be viewed as a simplification of implicit reasoning during real-world pretraining. Interestingly, we observe that overparameterization can impair the implicit reasoning performance due to excessive memorization. We investigate different factors that affect the loss curve when scaling different components of the knowledge graph, model size, and training steps. To predict the optimal model size for a specific knowledge graph, we find an empirical scaling law that shows optimal-sized LMs can approximately reason over 0.008 bit information per parameter. This work shows counterintuitive effects of model size scaling and provides new insights into the relationship between scaling and reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Polysemanticity is pervasive in language models and remains a major challenge for interpretation and model behavioral control. Leveraging sparse autoencoders (SAEs), we map the polysemantic topology of two small models (Pythia-70M and GPT-2-Small) to identify SAE feature pairs that are semantically unrelated yet exhibit interference within models. We intervene at four loci (prompt, token, feature, neuron) and measure induced shifts in the next-token prediction distribution, uncovering polysemantic structures that expose a systematic vulnerability in these models. Critically, interventions distilled from counterintuitive interference patterns shared by two small models transfer reliably to larger instruction-tuned models (Llama-3.1-8B/70B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct), yielding predictable behavioral shifts without access to model internals. These findings challenge the view that polysemanticity is purely stochastic, demonstrating instead that interference structures generalize across scale and family. Such generalization suggests a convergent, higher-order organization of internal representations, which is only weakly aligned with intuition and structured by latent regularities, offering new possibilities for both black-box control and theoretical insight into human and artificial cognition.

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended outputs of Multimodal Large Language Models has become a bottleneck as model capabilities, task diversity, and modality rapidly expand. Existing ``MLLM-as-a-Judge'' evaluators, though promising, remain constrained to specific tasks and aspects. In this paper, we argue that, on one hand, based on the interconnected nature of aspects, learning specific aspects can generalize to unseen aspects; on the other hand, jointly learning to assess multiple visual aspects and tasks may foster a synergistic effect. To this end, we propose UFEval, the first unified fine-grained evaluator with task and aspect generalization for four evaluation tasks -- Natural Language Generation, Image Understanding, Image Generation, and Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation. However, training such a unified evaluator is hindered by the lack of a large-scale, multi-modal, and aspect-level resource. To address this gap, we introduce FRABench, a comprehensive fine-grained evaluation dataset. Specifically, (1) We first construct a hierarchical aspect taxonomy encompassing 112 distinct aspects across the aforementioned four tasks. (2) Based on this taxonomy, we create FRABench, comprising 60.4k pairwise samples with 325k evaluation labels obtained from a combination of human and GPT-4o annotations. (3) Finally, leveraging FRABench, we develop UFEval, a unified fine-grained evaluator. Experiments show that learning on specific aspects enables UFEval to generalize to unseen aspects, and joint learning to assess diverse visual tasks and aspects can lead to substantial mutual benefits.

Abstract: We introduce a novel dataset designed to benchmark the physical and spatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) based on topology optimization, a method for computing optimal material distributions within a design space under prescribed loads and supports. In this dataset, LLMs are provided with conditions such as 2D boundary, applied forces and supports, and must reason about the resulting optimal material distribution. The dataset includes a variety of tasks, ranging from filling in masked regions within partial structures to predicting complete material distributions. Solving these tasks requires understanding the flow of forces and the required material distribution under given constraints, without access to simulation tools or explicit physical models, challenging models to reason about structural stability and spatial organization. Our dataset targets the evaluation of spatial and physical reasoning abilities in 2D settings, offering a complementary perspective to traditional language and logic benchmarks.

Abstract: Deep learning models trained on extensive Electronic Health Records (EHR) data have achieved high accuracy in diagnosis prediction, offering the potential to assist clinicians in decision-making and treatment planning. However, these models lack two crucial features that clinicians highly value: interpretability and interactivity. The ``black-box'' nature of these models makes it difficult for clinicians to understand the reasoning behind predictions, limiting their ability to make informed decisions. Additionally, the absence of interactive mechanisms prevents clinicians from incorporating their own knowledge and experience into the decision-making process. To address these limitations, we propose II-KEA, a knowledge-enhanced agent-driven causal discovery framework that integrates personalized knowledge databases and agentic LLMs. II-KEA enhances interpretability through explicit reasoning and causal analysis, while also improving interactivity by allowing clinicians to inject their knowledge and experience through customized knowledge bases and prompts. II-KEA is evaluated on both MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrating superior performance along with enhanced interpretability and interactivity, as evidenced by its strong results from extensive case studies.

Abstract: In group decision-making (GDM) scenarios, uncertainty, dynamic social structures, and vague information present major challenges for traditional opinion dynamics models. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel social network group decision-making (SNGDM) framework that integrates three-way decision (3WD) theory, dynamic network reconstruction, and linguistic opinion representation. First, the 3WD mechanism is introduced to explicitly model hesitation and ambiguity in agent judgments, thereby preventing irrational decisions. Second, a connection adjustment rule based on opinion similarity is developed, enabling agents to adaptively update their communication links and better reflect the evolving nature of social relationships. Third, linguistic terms are used to describe agent opinions, allowing the model to handle subjective, vague, or incomplete information more effectively. Finally, an integrated multi-agent decision-making framework is constructed, which simultaneously considers individual uncertainty, opinion evolution, and network dynamics. The proposed model is applied to a multi-UAV cooperative decision-making scenario, where simulation results and consensus analysis demonstrate its effectiveness. Experimental comparisons further verify the advantages of the algorithm in enhancing system stability and representing realistic decision-making behaviors.

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) tasks pose a unique challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often lack the capability for dynamic logical reasoning. In this work, we propose DEL-ToM, a framework that improves verifiable ToM reasoning through inference-time scaling rather than architectural changes. Our approach decomposes ToM tasks into a sequence of belief updates grounded in Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), enabling structured and verifiable dynamic logical reasoning. We use data generated automatically via a DEL simulator to train a verifier, which we call the Process Belief Model (PBM), to score each belief update step. During inference, the PBM evaluates candidate belief traces from the LLM and selects the highest-scoring one. This allows LLMs to allocate extra inference-time compute to yield more transparent reasoning. Experiments across model scales and benchmarks show that DEL-ToM consistently improves performance, demonstrating that verifiable belief supervision significantly enhances LLMs' ToM capabilities without retraining. Code is available at https://github.com/joel-wu/DEL-ToM.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning has long been a key benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs). Although substantial progress has been made on math word problems, the need for reasoning over tabular data in real-world applications has been overlooked. For instance, applications such as business intelligence demand not only multi-step numerical reasoning with tables but also robustness to incomplete or inconsistent information. However, comprehensive evaluation in this area is severely limited, constrained by the reliance on manually collected tables that are difficult to scale and the lack of coverage for potential traps encountered in real-world scenarios. To address this problem, we propose AutoT2T, a neuro-symbolic framework that controllably transforms math word problems into scalable and verified tabular reasoning tasks, enabling the evaluation of both accuracy and robustness. Building on this pipeline, we develop TabularGSM, a benchmark comprising three progressively complex subsets and a trap subset, with two complementary evaluation settings. Our study reveals three key observations: (1) Tabular structure makes mathematical reasoning more challenging; (2) The difficulties stem from the joint effects of tabular retrieval and reasoning; (3) Reasoning robustness is another significant issue that needs to be addressed in existing LLMs. In-depth analyses are conducted for each observation to guide future research.

Abstract: Self-taught reasoners (STaRs) enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging self-generated responses for self-training. Recent studies have incorporated reward models to guide response selection or decoding, aiming to obtain higher-quality data. However, they typically allocate a uniform sampling budget across all problems, overlooking the varying utility of problems at different difficulty levels. In this work, we conduct an empirical study and find that problems near the boundary of the LLM's reasoning capability offer significantly greater learning utility than both easy and overly difficult ones. To identify and exploit such problems, we propose HS-STaR, a Hierarchical Sampling framework for Self-Taught Reasoners. Given a fixed sampling budget, HS-STaR first performs lightweight pre-sampling with a reward-guided difficulty estimation strategy to efficiently identify boundary-level problems. Subsequently, it dynamically reallocates the remaining budget toward these high-utility problems during a re-sampling phase, maximizing the generation of valuable training data. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks and backbone LLMs demonstrate that HS-STaR significantly outperforms other baselines without requiring additional sampling budget.

Abstract: Spatial Planning is a crucial part in the field of spatial intelligence, which requires the understanding and planning about object arrangements in space perspective. AI agents with the spatial planning ability can better adapt to various real-world applications, including robotic manipulation, automatic assembly, urban planning etc. Recent works have attempted to construct benchmarks for evaluating the spatial intelligence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial reasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers from the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task execution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive benchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability of open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild requires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on the given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial planning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data collection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates spatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial understanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on MineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based agents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their spatial planning abilities. We believe our MineAnyBuild will open new avenues for the evaluation of spatial intelligence and help promote further development for open-world AI agents capable of spatial planning.

<title>The Ultimate Test of Superintelligent AI Agents: Can an AI Balance Care and Control in Asymmetric Relationships?</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces the Shepherd Test, a new conceptual test for assessing the moral and relational dimensions of superintelligent artificial agents. The test is inspired by human interactions with animals, where ethical considerations about care, manipulation, and consumption arise in contexts of asymmetric power and self-preservation. We argue that AI crosses an important, and potentially dangerous, threshold of intelligence when it exhibits the ability to manipulate, nurture, and instrumentally use less intelligent agents, while also managing its own survival and expansion goals. This includes the ability to weigh moral trade-offs between self-interest and the well-being of subordinate agents. The Shepherd Test thus challenges traditional AI evaluation paradigms by emphasizing moral agency, hierarchical behavior, and complex decision-making under existential stakes. We argue that this shift is critical for advancing AI governance, particularly as AI systems become increasingly integrated into multi-agent environments. We conclude by identifying key research directions, including the development of simulation environments for testing moral behavior in AI, and the formalization of ethical manipulation within multi-agent systems.

<title>Truly Assessing Fluid Intelligence of Large Language Models through Dynamic Reasoning Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capacities that mirror human-like thinking. However, whether LLMs possess genuine fluid intelligence (i.e., the ability to reason abstractly and generalize rules in novel situations) remains an open question. Existing reasoning benchmarks either focus on domain-specific knowledge (crystallized intelligence) or lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose DRE-Bench, a dynamic reasoning evaluation benchmark grounded in a hierarchical cognitive framework. DRE-Bench consists of 36 abstract reasoning tasks organized across four cognitive levels, with each task featuring multiple dynamic variants that test the same underlying latent rule. This design enables fine-grained, interpretable, and reliable assessments of fluid intelligence. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs, including both general LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.7) and reasoning LLMs (o1, DeepSeek-R1, QwQ, Skywork-OR1). Experimental results reveal that although most LLMs achieve competent and robust performance in low-level cognition, they struggle with high-level cognition and exhibit limited generalization as task complexity grows. Our findings highlight the gap between current LLMs and true human-like fluid intelligence and offer a new path for systematically tracking reasoning progress in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are reshaping the game industry, particularly with more intelligent and human-preferable game characters. However, existing game benchmarks fall short of practical needs: they lack evaluations of diverse LLM capabilities across various game genres, studies of agentic modules crucial for complex gameplay, and fine-tuning datasets for aligning pre-trained LLMs into gaming agents. To fill these gaps, we present Orak, a foundational benchmark designed to train and evaluate LLM agents across diverse real-world video games. Unlike existing benchmarks, Orak includes 12 popular video games spanning all major genres, enabling comprehensive studies of LLM capabilities and agentic modules essential for intricate game scenarios. To support consistent evaluation of LLMs, we introduce a plug-and-play interface based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables LLMs to seamlessly connect with games and manipulate agentic modules. Additionally, we propose a fine-tuning dataset, consisting of LLM gameplay trajectories across diverse game genres. Orak offers a comprehensive evaluation framework, encompassing general game score leaderboards, LLM battle arenas, and in-depth analyses of visual input state, agentic strategies, and fine-tuning effects, establishing a foundation towards building generic gaming agents. Code is available at https://github.com/krafton-ai/Orak.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models have achieved remarkable progress in integrating vision and language, enabling strong performance across perception, reasoning, and domain-specific tasks. However, their capacity to reason over multiple, visually similar inputs remains insufficiently explored. Such fine-grained comparative reasoning is central to real-world tasks, especially in mathematics and education, where learners must often distinguish between nearly identical diagrams to identify correct solutions. To address this gap, we present VisioMath, a curated benchmark of 1,800 high-quality K-12 mathematics problems in which all candidate answers are diagrams with subtle visual similarities. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LMMs, covering both leading closed-source systems and widely adopted open-source models, reveals a consistent decline in accuracy as inter-image similarity increases. Analysis indicates that the dominant failure mode stems from image-text misalignment: rather than grounding reasoning in textual cues, models often resort to shallow positional heuristics, resulting in systematic errors. We further explore three alignment-oriented strategies, spanning training-free approaches and finetuning, and achieve substantial accuracy gains. We hope that VisioMath will serve as a rigorous benchmark and catalyst for developing LMMs toward deeper diagram understanding, precise comparative reasoning, and grounded multi-image-text integration.

Abstract: Medical AI, including clinical language models, vision-language models, and multimodal health record models, already summarizes notes, answers questions, and supports decisions. Their adaptation to new populations, specialties, or care settings often relies on fine-tuning, prompting, or retrieval from external knowledge bases. These strategies can scale poorly and risk contextual errors: outputs that appear plausible but miss critical patient or situational information. We envision context switching as a solution. Context switching adjusts model reasoning at inference without retraining. Generative models can tailor outputs to patient biology, care setting, or disease. Multimodal models can reason on notes, laboratory results, imaging, and genomics, even when some data are missing or delayed. Agent models can coordinate tools and roles based on tasks and users. In each case, context switching enables medical AI to adapt across specialties, populations, and geographies. It requires advances in data design, model architectures, and evaluation frameworks, and establishes a foundation for medical AI that scales to infinitely many contexts while remaining reliable and suited to real-world care.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance, ranging from simple to complex tasks. However, while large proprietary models (e.g., models with over 100B parameters) achieve remarkable results across diverse tasks, they are often accessible through costly APIs, making frequent use too costly for many applications. In contrast, small open-source models (e.g., models with fewer than 3B parameters) are freely available and easy to deploy locally, but their performance on complex tasks remains limited. This trade-off raises a natural question: how can small and large models efficiently collaborate to combine their complementary strengths? To bridge this trade-off, we propose COPE, a test-time collaboration framework. A planner model first generates a plan, a high-level abstraction of the task, and this plan serves as a lightweight intermediate that guides a downstream executor model. Small and large models take turns acting as planner and executor, exchanging plans in a multi-stage cascade to collaboratively solve tasks. Through comprehensive experiments on benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, open-ended tasks, and agent tasks, we demonstrate that COPE achieves performance comparable to large proprietary models, while drastically reducing the inference API cost. These results
  highlight planning as an effective prior for cost-efficient inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deployed as agents introduce significant safety risks in clinical settings due to their potential for error and single points of failure. We introduce Tiered Agentic Oversight (TAO), a hierarchical multi-agent system that enhances AI safety through layered, automated supervision. Inspired by clinical hierarchies (e.g., nurse-physician-specialist) in hospital, TAO routes tasks to specialized agents based on complexity, creating a robust safety framework through automated inter- and intra-tier communication and role-playing. Crucially, this hierarchical structure functions as an effective error-correction mechanism, absorbing up to 24% of individual agent errors before they can compound. Our experiments reveal TAO outperforms single-agent and other multi-agent systems on 4 out of 5 healthcare safety benchmarks, with up to an 8.2% improvement. Ablation studies confirm key design principles of the system: (i) its adaptive architecture is over 3% safer than static, single-tier configurations, and (ii) its lower tiers are indispensable, as their removal causes the most significant degradation in overall safety. Finally, we validated the system's synergy with human doctors in a user study where a physician, acting as the highest tier agent, provided corrective feedback that improved medical triage accuracy from 40% to 60%.

<title>The 4th Dimension for Scaling Model Size</title>

Abstract: Scaling large language models typically involves three dimensions: depth, width, and parameter count. In this work, we explore a fourth dimension, \textbf{virtual logical depth} (VLD), which increases effective algorithmic depth without changing parameter count by reusing weights. While parameter reuse is not new, its role in scaling has been underexplored. Unlike recent test-time methods that scale token-wise, VLD alters the internal computation graph during training and inference. Through controlled experiments, we obtain three key insights. (1) \textit{Knowledge capacity vs. parameters}: at fixed parameter count, VLD leaves knowledge capacity nearly unchanged, while across models capacity still scales with parameters. (2) \textit{Reasoning vs. reuse}: properly implemented VLD substantially improves reasoning ability \emph{without} more parameters, decoupling reasoning from size. This suggests a new scaling path beyond token-wise test-time methods. (3) \textit{Robustness and generality}: reasoning gains persist across architectures and reuse schedules, showing VLD captures a general scaling behavior. These results provide insight into future scaling strategies and raise a deeper question: does superintelligence require ever-larger models, or can it be achieved by reusing parameters and increasing logical depth? We argue many unknown dynamics in scaling remain to be explored. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/virtual_logical_depth-8024/.

Abstract: We present Prover Agent, a novel AI agent for automated theorem proving that integrates large language models (LLMs) with a formal proof assistant, Lean. Prover Agent coordinates an informal reasoning LLM, a formal prover model, and feedback from Lean while also generating auxiliary lemmas. These auxiliary lemmas are not limited to subgoals in the formal proof but can also include special cases or potentially useful facts derived from the assumptions, which help in discovering a viable proof strategy. It achieves an 88.1% success rate on the MiniF2F benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art among methods using small language models (SLMs) with a much lower sample budget than previous approaches. We also present theoretical analyses and case studies that illustrate how these generated lemmas contribute to solving challenging problems.

Abstract: Many knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models for link prediction use powerful encoders. However, they often rely on a simple hidden vector-matrix multiplication to score subject-relation queries against candidate object entities. When the number of entities is larger than the model's embedding dimension, which is often the case in practice by several orders of magnitude, we have a linear output layer with a rank bottleneck. Such bottlenecked layers limit model expressivity. We investigate both theoretically and empirically how rank bottlenecks affect KGEs. We find that, by limiting the set of feasible predictions, rank bottlenecks hurt the ranking accuracy and distribution fidelity of scores. Inspired by the language modelling literature, we propose KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer to break rank bottlenecks in many KGEs. Our experiments show that KGE-MoS improves ranking performance of KGE models on large-scale datasets at a low parameter cost.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology epitomizes the complex challenges posed by human-made artifacts, particularly those widely integrated into society and exerting significant influence, highlighting potential benefits and their negative consequences. While other technologies may also pose substantial risks, AI's pervasive reach makes its societal effects especially profound. The complexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead to a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or understanding. To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and guidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools aimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI. The guidelines take a more holistic view of the issue but fail to provide techniques for quantifying trustworthiness. Conversely, while technological tools are better at achieving such quantification, they lack a holistic perspective, focusing instead on specific aspects of Trustworthy AI. This paper aims to introduce an assessment method that combines the ethical components of Trustworthy AI with the algorithmic processes of PageRank and TrustRank. The goal is to establish an assessment framework that minimizes the subjectivity inherent in the self-assessment techniques prevalent in the field by introducing algorithmic criteria. The application of our approach indicates that a holistic assessment of an AI system's trustworthiness can be achieved by providing quantitative insights while considering the theoretical content of relevant guidelines.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously complete tasks across platforms (\eg, Linux) by sequentially decomposing user instructions into action proposals that iteratively interact with visual elements in the evolving environment. However, two main challenges arise: i) planning (\ie, the action proposal sequence) under expansive action space, where selecting an appropriate plan is non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in complex and high-resolution interfaces, \ie, precisely interacting with visual targets. This paper investigates the aforementioned challenges with our \textbf{G}UI \textbf{T}est-time Scaling \textbf{A}gent, namely GTA1. First, we conduct test-time scaling to select the most appropriate action proposal: at each step, multiple candidate proposals are sampled and evaluated and selected by a judge model. It trades off computation for better decision quality by concurrent sampling. Second, we propose a model that improves grounding of the selected action proposals to its corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning (RL) facilitates grounding through inherent objective alignments, rewarding successful clicks on interface elements. Experimentally, GTA1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both grounding and agent task execution benchmarks. The code and models are released here.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display striking surface fluency yet systematically fail at tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy, and logical consistency. This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and \textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for enabling knowledge reasoning across various domains. Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and local information have achieved promising results. However, existing methods often suffer from score over-smoothing, which blurs the distinction between correct and incorrect answers and hinders reasoning effectiveness. To address this, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with dual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by segregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message passing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways, preventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination. In addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which partitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the candidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which alleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that DuetGraph achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with up to an 8.7% improvement in reasoning quality and a 1.8$\times$ acceleration in training efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/USTC-DataDarknessLab/DuetGraph.git.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing but typically requires a high level of expertise from designers. To lower the entry barrier and improve design efficiency, we present an agent for CAD conceptual design powered by large language models (LLMs). The agent accepts both abstract textual descriptions and freehand sketches as input, engaging in interactive dialogue with users to refine and clarify design requirements through comprehensive requirement analysis. Built upon a novel Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm (CIP), the agent generates high-quality CAD modeling code. During the generation process, the agent incorporates iterative visual feedback to improve model quality. Generated design cases are stored in a structured knowledge base, enabling continuous improvement of the agent's code generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD code generation.

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is ever-increasing, yet the quadratic complexity of standard self-attention presents a significant bottleneck. While existing sparse attention mechanisms enhance efficiency, they often suffer from limitations such as static patterns and information loss. This paper introduces a Trainable Dynamic Mask Sparse Attention mechanism that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, it leverages value vectors to dynamically generate content-aware sparse masks, enabling the model to adaptively identify and focus on crucial information. Second, it implements a position-aware sparse attention computation that effectively skips unnecessary computational regions. Finally, we ensure that the introduced dynamic masks and sparse weights do not obstruct gradients, thereby supporting end-to-end training. This dual-sparsity design allows the model to retain complete information while significantly reducing computational complexity, achieving an excellent balance between efficiency and performance. We validate the performance of Dynamic Mask Attention through comprehensive experiments. Comparative studies demonstrate that our method consistently achieves Pareto dominance across various tasks, including scaling laws, multi-query associative recall, general benchmarks, and needle-in-a-haystack tests, delivering up to 10 times acceleration. These results highlight its capability to effectively balance model efficiency with long-context modeling. Our computational kernel is open-sourced at https://github.com/SmallDoges/flash-dmattn to facilitate further research and application within the community.

Abstract: While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate impressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their intelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency, while interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically ignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm, we introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate, but to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the full sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence, OmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create scenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine cross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal models reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on high-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges requiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this fragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic performance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive "less is more" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically improve performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI requires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic fusion. Our platform is available for anonymous review at https://github.com/fuqingbie/omni-game-benchmark.

This design shifts the focus toward principled data modeling, providing a declarative language where data types are directly exposed to large language models and composed through transductions triggered by type connections. We present a range of structured data workflow tasks and empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach, including data wrangling, text-to-SQL semantic parsing, and domain-specific multiple-choice question answering.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this, we propose Hierarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. Our extensive experiments validate that HICRA significantly outperforms strong baselines, and offer deep insights into how reasoning advances through the lens of strategic exploration.

<title>Hierarchical Task Environments as the Next Frontier for Embodied World Models in Robot Soccer</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in agent development have focused on scaling model size and raw interaction data, mirroring the successes seen in large language models. However, for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks such as robotic soccer, this end-to-end approach often fails due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in developing embodied world models is not merely increasing the fidelity or size of environments, but scaling their structural complexity through explicit hierarchical scaffolding. We posit that an effective world model for decision-making must model not only the world's physics but also its task semantics. Drawing from a systematic review of 2024 research in low-resource multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods, such as Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) and Bayesian Strategy Networks (BSNs), with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These methods decompose complex goals into manageable subgoals, creating an intrinsic curriculum that shapes agent learning. We propose that such structured environments are essential for bridging the gap between simple, reactive behaviors and sophisticated, strategic team play. We further extend this principle, proposing that this scaffolding can be generalized to other complex domains and dynamically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which act as generative world models of tasks. By building environments with explicit, composable task layers, we can guide agent exploration more efficiently, generate meaningful learning signals, and ultimately train more capable and general-purpose agents with fewer resources than purely end-to-end approaches.

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges, there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs), which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy. However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving healthcare monitoring.

<title>The Illusion of Diminishing Returns: Measuring Long Horizon Execution in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing returns? In this work, we show that short-task benchmarks may give an illusion of slowing progress, as even marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential improvements in the length of tasks a model can successfully complete. Then, we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. So, we propose isolating execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to solve a long-horizon task. First, we find that larger models can correctly execute significantly more turns even when small models have near-perfect single-turn accuracy. We then observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations -- curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns. Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. But, we find that thinking mitigates self-conditioning, and also enables execution of much longer tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on the length of tasks they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time compute for long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the remarkable efficiency, flexibility, and adaptability of the human brain in artificial systems. Unlike conventional digital approaches, which suffer from the Von Neumann bottleneck and depend on massive computational and energy resources, neuromorphic systems exploit brain-inspired principles of computation to achieve orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency. By drawing on insights from a wide range of disciplines, including artificial intelligence, physics, chemistry, biology, neuroscience, cognitive science and materials science, neuromorphic computing promises to deliver intelligent systems that are sustainable, transparent, and widely accessible. A central challenge, however, is to identify a unifying theoretical framework capable of bridging these diverse disciplines. We argue that dynamical systems theory provides such a foundation. Rooted in differential calculus, it offers a principled language for modeling inference, learning, and control in both natural and artificial substrates. Within this framework, noise can be harnessed as a resource for learning, while differential genetic programming enables the discovery of dynamical systems that implement adaptive behaviors. Embracing this perspective paves the way toward emergent neuromorphic intelligence, where intelligent behavior arises from the dynamics of physical substrates, advancing both the science and sustainability of AI.

Abstract: Training agents to act in embodied environments typically requires vast training data or access to accurate simulation, neither of which exists for many cases in the real world. Instead, world models are emerging as an alternative leveraging offline, passively collected data, they make it possible to generate diverse worlds for training agents in simulation. In this work, we harness world models to generate imagined environments to train robust agents capable of generalizing to novel task variations. One of the challenges in doing this is ensuring the agent trains on useful generated data. We thus propose a novel approach, IMAC (Imagined Autocurricula), leveraging Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), which induces an automatic curriculum over generated worlds. In a series of challenging, procedurally generated environments, we show it is possible to achieve strong transfer performance on held-out environments, having trained only inside a world model learned from a narrower dataset. We believe this opens the path to utilizing larger-scale, foundation world models for generally capable agents.

Abstract: Creators struggle to edit long-form, narrative-rich videos not because of UI complexity, but due to the cognitive demands of searching, storyboarding, and sequencing hours of footage. Existing transcript- or embedding-based methods fall short for creative workflows, as models struggle to track characters, infer motivations, and connect dispersed events. We present a prompt-driven, modular editing system that helps creators restructure multi-hour content through free-form prompts rather than timelines. At its core is a semantic indexing pipeline that builds a global narrative via temporal segmentation, guided memory compression, and cross-granularity fusion, producing interpretable traces of plot, dialogue, emotion, and context. Users receive cinematic edits while optionally refining transparent intermediate outputs. Evaluated on 400+ videos with expert ratings, QA, and preference studies, our system scales prompt-driven editing, preserves narrative coherence, and balances automation with creator control.

Abstract: Lane-change maneuvers are a leading cause of highway accidents, underscoring the need for accurate intention prediction to improve the safety and decision-making of autonomous driving systems. While prior studies using machine learning and deep learning methods (e.g., SVM, CNN, LSTM, Transformers) have shown promise, most approaches remain limited by binary classification, lack of scenario diversity, and degraded performance under longer prediction horizons. In this study, we propose a physics-informed AI framework that explicitly integrates vehicle kinematics, interaction feasibility, and traffic-safety metrics (e.g., distance headway, time headway, time-to-collision, closing gap time) into the learning process. lane-change prediction is formulated as a three-class problem that distinguishes left change, right change, and no change, and is evaluated across both straight highway segments (highD) and complex ramp scenarios (exiD). By integrating vehicle kinematics with interaction features, our machine learning models, particularly LightGBM, achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization. Results show up to 99.8% accuracy and 93.6% macro F1 on highD, and 96.1% accuracy and 88.7% macro F1 on exiD at a 1-second horizon, outperforming a two-layer stacked LSTM baseline. These findings demonstrate the practical advantages of a physics-informed and feature-rich machine learning framework for real-time lane-change intention prediction in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614 radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent, scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols. Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

<title>LogReasoner: Empowering LLMs with Expert-like Coarse-to-Fine Reasoning for Automated Log Analysis</title>

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction. However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1) coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning, then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and Large Language Models (LLMs) in particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Despite its similarities to compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models, bridging the gap between human and machine intelligence.

Abstract: A reverse dictionary takes a target word's description as input and returns the words that fit the description. Reverse Dictionaries are useful for new language learners, anomia patients, and for solving common tip-of-the-tongue problems (lethologica). Currently, there does not exist any Reverse Dictionary provider with support for any Indian Language. We present a novel open-source cross-lingual reverse dictionary system with support for Indian languages. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based deep learning approach to tackle the limitations faced by the existing systems using the mT5 model. This architecture uses the Translation Language Modeling (TLM) technique, rather than the conventional BERT's Masked Language Modeling (MLM) technique.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) trains deep neural networks to optimize several objectives simultaneously using a shared backbone, which leads to reduced computational costs, improved data efficiency, and enhanced performance through cross-task knowledge sharing. Although recent gradient manipulation techniques aim to find a common descent direction that benefits all tasks, conventional empirical loss minimization still leaves models vulnerable to overfitting and gradient conflicts. To address this, we introduce a novel MTL framework that leverages weight perturbation to regulate gradient norms, thus improving generalization. By adaptively modulating weight perturbations, our approach harmonizes task-specific gradients, reducing conflicts and encouraging more robust learning across tasks. Theoretical insights reveal that controlling the gradient norm through weight perturbation directly contributes to better generalization. Extensive experiments across diverse applications demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing gradient-based MTL techniques in terms of task performance and overall model robustness.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been widely used in large-scale Vision and Language Pre-training (VLP) models. Though previous VLP works have proved the effectiveness of ViTs, they still suffer from computational efficiency brought by the long visual sequence. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose an efficient vision-and-language pre-training model with \textbf{T}ext-\textbf{R}elevant \textbf{I}mage \textbf{P}atch \textbf{S}election, namely TRIPS, which reduces the visual sequence progressively with a text-guided patch-selection layer in the visual backbone for efficient training and inference. The patch-selection layer can dynamically compute text-dependent visual attention to identify the attentive image tokens with text guidance and fuse inattentive ones in an end-to-end manner. Meanwhile, TRIPS does not introduce extra parameters to ViTs. Experimental results on a variety of popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that TRIPS gain a speedup of 40\% over previous similar VLP models, yet with competitive or better downstream task performance.

Abstract: Dialogue systems are frequently updated to accommodate new services, but naively updating them by continually training with data for new services in diminishing performance on previously learnt services. Motivated by the insight that dialogue state tracking (DST), a crucial component of dialogue systems that estimates the user's goal as a conversation proceeds, is a simple natural language understanding task, we propose reformulating it as a bundle of granular example-guided question answering tasks to minimize the task shift between services and thus benefit continual learning. Our approach alleviates service-specific memorization and teaches a model to contextualize the given question and example to extract the necessary information from the conversation. We find that a model with just 60M parameters can achieve a significant boost by learning to learn from in-context examples retrieved by a retriever trained to identify turns with similar dialogue state changes. Combining our method with dialogue-level memory replay, our approach attains state of the art performance on DST continual learning metrics without relying on any complex regularization or parameter expansion methods.

Abstract: Experimental and observational studies often lack validity due to untestable assumptions. We propose a double machine learning approach to combine experimental and observational studies, allowing practitioners to test for assumption violations and estimate treatment effects consistently. Our framework proposes a falsification test for external validity and ignorability under milder assumptions. We provide consistent treatment effect estimators even when one of the assumptions is violated. However, our no-free-lunch theorem highlights the necessity of accurately identifying the violated assumption for consistent treatment effect estimation. Through comparative analyses, we show our framework's superiority over existing data fusion methods. The practical utility of our approach is further exemplified by three real-world case studies, underscoring its potential for widespread application in empirical research.

Abstract: Current imitation learning approaches, predominantly based on deep neural networks (DNNs), offer efficient mechanisms for learning driving policies from real-world datasets. However, they suffer from inherent limitations in interpretability and generalizability--issues of critical importance in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce Symbolic Imitation Learning (SIL), a novel framework that leverages Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to derive explainable and generalizable driving policies from synthetic datasets. We evaluate SIL on real-world HighD and NGSim datasets, comparing its performance with state-of-the-art neural imitation learning methods using metrics such as collision rate, lane change efficiency, and average speed. The results indicate that SIL significantly enhances policy transparency while maintaining strong performance across varied driving conditions. These findings highlight the potential of integrating ILP into imitation learning to promote safer and more reliable autonomous systems.

Abstract: $ $Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly utilized in various applications, with code generations being a notable example. While previous research has shown that LLMs have the capability to generate both secure and insecure code, the literature does not take into account what factors help generate secure and effective code. Therefore in this paper we focus on identifying and understanding the conditions and contexts in which LLMs can be effectively and safely deployed in real-world scenarios to generate quality code. We conducted a comparative analysis of four advanced LLMs--GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using ChatGPT and Bard and Gemini from Google--using 9 separate tasks to assess each model's code generation capabilities. We contextualized our study to represent the typical use cases of a real-life developer employing LLMs for everyday tasks as work. Additionally, we place an emphasis on security awareness which is represented through the use of two distinct versions of our developer persona. In total, we collected 61 code outputs and analyzed them across several aspects: functionality, security, performance, complexity, and reliability. These insights are crucial for understanding the models' capabilities and limitations, guiding future development and practical applications in the field of automated code generation.

Abstract: Unlearning in Federated Learning (FL) presents significant challenges, as models grow and evolve with complex inheritance relationships. This complexity is amplified when blockchain is employed to ensure the integrity and traceability of FL, where the need to edit multiple interlinked blockchain records and update all inherited models complicates the process.In this paper, we introduce Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a novel framework with a dual-chain structure comprising a live chain and an archive chain for enabling unlearning capabilities within Blockchained FL. BlockFUL introduces two new unlearning paradigms, i.e., parallel and sequential paradigms, which can be effectively implemented through gradient-ascent-based and re-training-based unlearning methods. These methods enhance the unlearning process across multiple inherited models by enabling efficient consensus operations and reducing computational costs. Our extensive experiments validate that these methods effectively reduce data dependency and operational overhead, thereby boosting the overall performance of unlearning inherited models within BlockFUL on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets using AlexNet, ResNet18, and MobileNetV2 models.

Abstract: This paper addresses federated learning (FL) in the context of malicious Byzantine attacks and data heterogeneity. We introduce a novel Robust Average Gradient Algorithm (RAGA), which uses the geometric median for aggregation and {allows flexible round number for local updates.} Unlike most existing resilient approaches, which base their convergence analysis on strongly-convex loss functions or homogeneously distributed datasets, this work conducts convergence analysis for both strongly-convex and non-convex loss functions over heterogeneous datasets. The theoretical analysis indicates that as long as the fraction of the {data} from malicious users is less than half, RAGA can achieve convergence at a rate of $\mathcal{O}({1}/{T^{2/3- \delta}})$ for non-convex loss functions, where $T$ is the iteration number and $\delta \in (0, 2/3)$. For strongly-convex loss functions, the convergence rate is linear. Furthermore, the stationary point or global optimal solution is shown to be attainable as data heterogeneity diminishes. Experimental results validate the robustness of RAGA against Byzantine attacks and demonstrate its superior convergence performance compared to baselines under varying intensities of Byzantine attacks on heterogeneous datasets.

Abstract: We introduce a class of neural networks named PLEIADES (PoLynomial Expansion In Adaptive Distributed Event-based Systems), which contains temporal convolution kernels generated from orthogonal polynomial basis functions. We focus on interfacing these networks with event-based data to perform online spatiotemporal classification and detection with low latency. By virtue of using structured temporal kernels and event-based data, we have the freedom to vary the sample rate of the data along with the discretization step-size of the network without additional finetuning. We experimented with three event-based benchmarks and obtained state-of-the-art results on all three by large margins with significantly smaller memory and compute costs. We achieved: 1) 99.59% accuracy with 192K parameters on the DVS128 hand gesture recognition dataset and 100% with a small additional output filter; 2) 99.58% test accuracy with 277K parameters on the AIS 2024 eye tracking challenge; and 3) 0.556 mAP with 576k parameters on the PROPHESEE 1 Megapixel Automotive Detection Dataset.

<title>FusionDTI: Fine-grained Binding Discovery with Token-level Fusion for Drug-Target Interaction</title>

Abstract: Predicting drug-target interaction (DTI) is critical in the drug discovery process. Despite remarkable advances in recent DTI models through the integration of representations from diverse drug and target encoders, such models often struggle to capture the fine-grained interactions between drugs and protein, i.e. the binding of specific drug atoms (or substructures) and key amino acids of proteins, which is crucial for understanding the binding mechanisms and optimising drug design. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, called FusionDTI, which uses a token-level Fusion module to effectively learn fine-grained information for Drug-Target Interaction. In particular, our FusionDTI model uses the SELFIES representation of drugs to mitigate sequence fragment invalidation and incorporates the structure-aware (SA) vocabulary of target proteins to address the limitation of amino acid sequences in structural information, additionally leveraging pre-trained language models extensively trained on large-scale biomedical datasets as encoders to capture the complex information of drugs and targets. Experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets show that our proposed FusionDTI model achieves the best performance in DTI prediction compared with seven existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our case study indicates that FusionDTI could highlight the potential binding sites, enhancing the explainability of the DTI prediction.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.

Abstract: We present SciRIFF (Scientific Resource for Instruction-Following and Finetuning), a dataset of 137K instruction-following instances for training and evaluation, covering 54 tasks. These tasks span five core scientific literature understanding capabilities: information extraction, summarization, question answering, claim verification, and classification. SciRIFF is unique in being entirely expert-written, high-quality instruction-following dataset for extracting and synthesizing information from research literature across diverse scientific fields. It features complex instructions with long input contexts, detailed task descriptions, and structured outputs. To demonstrate its utility, we finetune a series of large language models (LLMs) using a mix of general-domain and SciRIFF instructions. On nine out-of-distribution held-out tasks (referred to as SciRIFF-Eval), LLMs finetuned on SciRIFF achieve 70.6% average improvement over baselines trained only on general-domain instructions. SciRIFF facilitates the development and evaluation of LLMs to help researchers navigate the rapidly growing body of scientific literature.

Abstract: Graph pooling has gained attention for its ability to obtain effective node and graph representations for various downstream tasks. Despite the recent surge in graph pooling approaches, there is a lack of standardized experimental settings and fair benchmarks to evaluate their performance. To address this issue, we have constructed a comprehensive benchmark that includes 17 graph pooling methods and 28 different graph datasets. This benchmark systematically assesses the performance of graph pooling methods in three dimensions, i.e., effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. We first evaluate the performance of these graph pooling approaches across different tasks including graph classification, graph regression and node classification. Then, we investigate their performance under potential noise attacks and out-of-distribution shifts in real-world scenarios. We also involve detailed efficiency analysis, backbone analysis, parameter analysis and visualization to provide more evidence. Extensive experiments validate the strong capability and applicability of graph pooling approaches in various scenarios, which can provide valuable insights and guidance for deep geometric learning research. The source code of our benchmark is available at https://github.com/goose315/Graph_Pooling_Benchmark.

Abstract: Recent advances in general-purpose AI underscore the urgent need to align AI systems with human goals and values. Yet, the lack of a clear, shared understanding of what constitutes "alignment" limits meaningful progress and cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this position paper, we argue that the research community should explicitly define and critically reflect on "alignment" to account for the bidirectional and dynamic relationship between humans and AI. Through a systematic review of over 400 papers spanning HCI, NLP, ML, and more, we examine how alignment is currently defined and operationalized. Building on this analysis, we introduce the Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment framework, which not only incorporates traditional efforts to align AI with human values but also introduces the critical, underexplored dimension of aligning humans with AI -- supporting cognitive, behavioral, and societal adaptation to rapidly advancing AI technologies. Our findings reveal significant gaps in current literature, especially in long-term interaction design, human value modeling, and mutual understanding. We conclude with three central challenges and actionable recommendations to guide future research toward more nuanced, reciprocal, and human-AI alignment approaches.

<title>Understanding Transformer Architecture through Continuous Dynamics: A Partial Differential Equation Perspective</title>

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet a principled theoretical understanding of its internal mechanisms remains elusive. This paper introduces a novel analytical framework that reconceptualizes the Transformer's discrete, layered structure as a continuous spatiotemporal dynamical system governed by a master Partial Differential Equation (PDE). Within this paradigm, we map core architectural components to distinct mathematical operators: self-attention as a non-local interaction, the feed-forward network as a local reaction, and, critically, residual connections and layer normalization as indispensable stabilization mechanisms. We do not propose a new model, but rather employ the PDE system as a theoretical probe to analyze the mathematical necessity of these components. By comparing a standard Transformer with a PDE simulator that lacks explicit stabilizers, our experiments provide compelling empirical evidence for our central thesis. We demonstrate that without residual connections, the system suffers from catastrophic representational drift, while the absence of layer normalization leads to unstable, explosive training dynamics. Our findings reveal that these seemingly heuristic "tricks" are, in fact, fundamental mathematical stabilizers required to tame an otherwise powerful but inherently unstable continuous system. This work offers a first-principles explanation for the Transformer's design and establishes a new paradigm for analyzing deep neural networks through the lens of continuous dynamics.

Abstract: Efficient navigation in dynamic environments is crucial for autonomous robots interacting with moving agents and static obstacles. We present a novel deep reinforcement learning approach that improves robot navigation and interaction with different types of agents and obstacles based on specific safety requirements. Our approach uses information about the entity types, improving collision avoidance and ensuring safer navigation. We introduce a new reward function that penalizes the robot for being close to or colliding with different entities such as adults, bicyclists, children, and static obstacles, while also encouraging the robot's progress toward the goal. We propose an optimized algorithm that significantly accelerates the training, validation, and testing phases, enabling efficient learning in complex environments. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art navigation and collision avoidance methods.

Abstract: Industry 4.0 has revolutionized manufacturing by driving digitalization and shifting the paradigm toward additive manufacturing (AM). Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized, cost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer extrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods. However, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often requires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely compromise product quality. While automated error detection and machine learning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups, firmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive labeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to detect and address printing defects. The LLM evaluates print quality by analyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying failure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters. It then generates and executes a corrective action plan. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a control group of engineers with diverse AM expertise. Our evaluation demonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D printing errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer adhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures and autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention.

Abstract: In the last years, an increasing number of learning-based approaches have been proposed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems such as routing problems. Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems. However, such models are ill-suited for a wide range of real-world problems that feature non-Euclidean and asymmetric edge costs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based and edge-focused neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). Using GREAT as an encoder to capture the properties of a routing problem instance, we build a reinforcement learning framework which we apply to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean variants of vehicle routing problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem, Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and Orienteering Problem. Our framework is among the first to tackle non-Euclidean variants of these problems and achieves competitive results among learning-based benchmarks.

<title>Parse Trees Guided LLM Prompt Compression</title>

Abstract: Offering rich contexts to Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown to boost the performance in various tasks, but the resulting longer prompt would increase the computational cost and might exceed the input limit of LLMs. Recently, some prompt compression methods have been suggested to shorten the length of prompts by using language models to generate shorter prompts or by developing computational models to select important parts of original prompt. The generative compression methods would suffer from issues like hallucination, while the selective compression methods have not involved linguistic rules and overlook the global structure of prompt. To this end, we propose a novel selective compression method called PartPrompt. It first obtains a parse tree for each sentence based on linguistic rules, and calculates local information entropy for each node in a parse tree. These local parse trees are then organized into a global tree according to the hierarchical structure such as the dependency of sentences, paragraphs, and sections. After that, the root-ward propagation and leaf-ward propagation are proposed to adjust node values over the global tree. Finally, a recursive algorithm is developed to prune the global tree based on the adjusted node values. The experiments show that PartPrompt receives the state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, metrics, compression ratios, and target LLMs for inference. The in-depth ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of designs in PartPrompt, and other additional experiments also demonstrate its superiority in terms of the coherence of compressed prompts and in the extreme long prompt scenario.

Abstract: Cellular Radio Access Networks (RANs) are rapidly evolving towards 6G, driven by the need to reduce costs and introduce new revenue streams for operators and enterprises. In this context, AI emerges as a key enabler in solving complex RAN problems spanning both the management and application domains. Unfortunately, and despite the undeniable promise of AI, several practical challenges still remain, hindering the widespread adoption of AI applications in the RAN space. In this work, we attempt to shed light to these challenges and argue that existing approaches in addressing them are inadequate for realizing the vision of a truly AI-native 6G network. We propose a distributed AI platform architecture, tailored to the needs of an AI-native RAN.

Abstract: This paper explains a neural network for image generation from a new perspective, i.e., explaining representation structures for image generation. We propose a set of desirable properties to define the representation structure of a neural network for image generation, including feature completeness, spatial boundedness and consistency. These properties enable us to propose a method for disentangling primitive feature components from the intermediate-layer features, where each feature component generates a primitive regional pattern covering multiple image patches. In this way, the generation of the entire image can be explained as a superposition of these feature components. We prove that these feature components, which satisfy the feature completeness property and the linear additivity property (derived from the feature completeness, spatial boundedness, and consistency properties), can be computed as OR Harsanyi interaction. Experiments have verified the faithfulness of the disentangled primitive regional patterns.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning (ICL), a supervised learning technique that relies on adding annotated examples to the model context. We investigate a contextual bandit version of in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL), where models learn in-context, online, from external reward, instead of supervised data. We show that LLMs effectively demonstrate such learning, and provide a detailed study of the phenomena, experimenting with challenging classification tasks and models of sizes from 500M to 70B parameters. This includes identifying and addressing the instability of the process, demonstrating learning with both semantic and abstract labels, and showing scaling trends. Our findings highlight ICRL capabilities in LLMs, while also underscoring fundamental limitations in their implicit reasoning about errors.

Abstract: Fuelled by the popularity of the transformer architecture in deep learning, several works have investigated what formal languages a transformer can learn from data. Nonetheless, existing results remain hard to compare due to methodological differences. To address this, we construct finite state automata as high-level abstractions of transformers trained on regular languages using queries and counterexamples. Concretely, we extract Moore machines, as many training tasks used in literature can be mapped onto them. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by studying positive-only learning and the sequence accuracy measure in detail.

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have emerged as powerful models for graph learning tasks, exhibiting promising performance in various domains. While their empirical success is evident, there is a growing need to understand their essential ability from a theoretical perspective. Existing theoretical research has primarily focused on the analysis of single-layer GCNs, while a comprehensive theoretical exploration of the stability and generalization of deep GCNs remains limited. In this paper, we bridge this gap by delving into the stability and generalization properties of deep GCNs, aiming to provide valuable insights by characterizing rigorously the associated upper bounds. Our theoretical results reveal that the stability and generalization of deep GCNs are influenced by certain key factors, such as the maximum absolute eigenvalue of the graph filter operators and the depth of the network. Our theoretical studies contribute to a deeper understanding of the stability and generalization properties of deep GCNs, potentially paving the way for developing more reliable and well-performing models.

Abstract: Next location prediction is a critical task in human mobility analysis.Existing methods typically formulate it as a classification task based on discrete location IDs, which hinders spatial continuity modeling and limits generalization to new cities. In this paper, we propose NextLocLLM, a novel framework that reformulates next-location prediction as coordinate regression and integrates LLMs for both location semantics encoding and coordinate-level prediction. To model location functional semantics, it constructs LLM-enhanced POI embeddings by leveraging language understanding capabilities of LLMs to extract functional semantics from textual descriptions of POI categories. These POI embeddings are combined with spatiotemporal trajectory representation and fed into the same LLM, enabling unified semantic and predictive modeling. A lightweight regression head generates coordinate outputs, which are mapped to top-k candidate locations via post-prediction retrieval module, ensuring structured outputs. Experiments across diverse cities show that NextLocLLM outperforms existing baselines in both supervised and zero-shot settings. Code is available at: https://github.com/liuwj2000/NexelocLLM.

Abstract: Training neural networks requires significant computational resources and energy. Methods like mixed-precision and quantization-aware training reduce bit usage, yet they still depend heavily on computationally expensive gradient-based optimization. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift: eliminate gradients altogether. One might hope that, in a finite quantized space, finding optimal weights with out gradients would be easier but we theoretically prove that this problem is NP-hard even in simple settings where the continuous case is efficiently solvable. To address this, we introduce a novel heuristic optimization framework that avoids full weight updates and significantly improves efficiency. Empirically, our method achieves performance comparable to that of full-precision gradient-based training on standard datasets and architectures, while using up to 3x less energy and requiring up to 5x fewer parameter updates.

Abstract: Recent advancements in speech-language models have yielded significant improvements in speech tokenization and synthesis. However, effectively mapping the complex, multidimensional attributes of speech into discrete tokens remains challenging. This process demands acoustic, semantic, and contextual information for precise speech representations. Existing speech representations generally fall into two categories: acoustic tokens from audio codecs and semantic tokens from speech self-supervised learning models. Although recent efforts have unified acoustic and semantic tokens for improved performance, they overlook the crucial role of contextual representation in comprehensive speech modeling. Our empirical investigations reveal that the absence of contextual representations results in elevated Word Error Rate (WER) and Word Information Lost (WIL) scores in speech transcriptions. To address these limitations, we propose two novel distillation approaches: (1) a language model (LM)-guided distillation method that incorporates contextual information, and (2) a combined LM and self-supervised speech model (SM)-guided distillation technique that effectively distills multimodal representations (acoustic, semantic, and contextual) into a comprehensive speech tokenizer, termed DM-Codec. The DM-Codec architecture adopts a streamlined encoder-decoder framework with a Residual Vector Quantizer (RVQ) and incorporates the LM and SM during the training process. Experiments show DM-Codec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art speech tokenization models, reducing WER by up to 13.46%, WIL by 9.82%, and improving speech quality by 5.84% and intelligibility by 1.85% on the LibriSpeech benchmark dataset. Code, samples, and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/mubtasimahasan/DM-Codec.

Abstract: Plasticity Loss is an increasingly important phenomenon that refers to the empirical observation that as a neural network is continually trained on a sequence of changing tasks, its ability to adapt to a new task diminishes over time. We introduce Self-Normalized Resets (SNR), a simple adaptive algorithm that mitigates plasticity loss by resetting a neuron's weights when evidence suggests its firing rate has effectively dropped to zero. Across a battery of continual learning problems and network architectures, we demonstrate that SNR consistently attains superior performance compared to its competitor algorithms. We also demonstrate that SNR is robust to its sole hyperparameter, its rejection percentile threshold, while competitor algorithms show significant sensitivity. SNR's threshold-based reset mechanism is motivated by a simple hypothesis test that we derive. Seen through the lens of this hypothesis test, competing reset proposals yield suboptimal error rates in correctly detecting inactive neurons, potentially explaining our experimental observations. We also conduct a theoretical investigation of the optimization landscape for the problem of learning a single ReLU. We show that even when initialized adversarially, an idealized version of SNR learns the target ReLU, while regularization based approaches can fail to learn.

Abstract: Climate models serve as critical tools for evaluating the effects of climate change and projecting future climate scenarios. However, the reliance on numerical simulations of physical equations renders them computationally intensive and inefficient. While deep learning methodologies have made significant progress in weather forecasting, they are still unstable for climate emulation tasks. Here, we propose PACER, a lightweight 684K parameter Physics Informed Uncertainty Aware Climate Emulator. PACER emulates temperature and precipitation stably for 86 years while only being trained on greenhouse gas emissions data. We incorporate a fundamental physical law of advection-diffusion in PACER accounting for boundary conditions and empirically estimating the diffusion co-efficient and flow velocities from emissions data. PACER has been trained on 15 climate models provided by ClimateSet outperforming baselines across most of the climate models and advancing a new state of the art in a climate diagnostic task.

In this work, we reveal a new side-channel whereby input-dependent patterns of correct and incorrect speculations can be inferred by monitoring per-iteration token counts or packet sizes.We demonstrate that an adversary observing these patterns can fingerprint user queries with >90% accuracy across four speculative-decoding schemes, REST (100\%), LADE (up to 92%), BiLD (up to 95%), and EAGLE (up to 77.6%) and leak confidential datastore contents used for prediction at rates exceeding 25 tokens/sec. We evaluate the side-channel attacks in both research prototypes as well as the production-grade vLLM serving framework. To defend against these, we propose and evaluate a suite of mitigations, including packet padding and iteration-wise token aggregation.

Abstract: Building a universal trajectory foundation model is a promising solution to address the limitations of existing trajectory modeling approaches, such as task specificity, regional dependency, and data sensitivity. Despite its potential, data preparation, pre-training strategy development, and architectural design present significant challenges in constructing this model. Therefore, we introduce UniTraj, a Universal Trajectory foundation model that aims to address these limitations through three key innovations. First, we construct WorldTrace, an unprecedented dataset of 2.45 million trajectories with billions of GPS points spanning 70 countries, providing the diverse geographic coverage essential for region-independent modeling. Second, we develop novel pre-training strategies--Adaptive Trajectory Resampling and Self-supervised Trajectory Masking--that enable robust learning from heterogeneous trajectory data with varying sampling rates and quality. Finally, we tailor a flexible model architecture to accommodate a variety of trajectory tasks, effectively capturing complex movement patterns to support broad applicability. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior scalability, adaptability, and generalization, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal yet non-exclusive training resource.

<title>UniHR: Hierarchical Representation Learning for Unified Knowledge Graph Link Prediction</title>

Abstract: Real-world knowledge graphs (KGs) contain not only standard triple-based facts, but also more complex, heterogeneous types of facts, such as hyper-relational facts with auxiliary key-value pairs, temporal facts with additional timestamps, and nested facts that imply relationships between facts. These richer forms of representation have attracted significant attention due to their enhanced expressiveness and capacity to model complex semantics in real-world scenarios. However, most existing studies suffer from two main limitations: (1) they typically focus on modeling only specific types of facts, thus making it difficult to generalize to real-world scenarios with multiple fact types; and (2) they struggle to achieve generalizable hierarchical (inter-fact and intra-fact) modeling due to the complexity of these representations. To overcome these limitations, we propose UniHR, a Unified Hierarchical Representation learning framework, which consists of a learning-optimized Hierarchical Data Representation (HiDR) module and a unified Hierarchical Structure Learning (HiSL) module. The HiDR module unifies hyper-relational KGs, temporal KGs, and nested factual KGs into triple-based representations. Then HiSL incorporates intra-fact and inter-fact message passing, focusing on enhancing both semantic information within individual facts and enriching the structural information between facts. To go beyond the unified method itself, we further explore the potential of unified representation in complex real-world scenarios, including joint modeling of multi-task, compositional and hybrid facts. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets across 5 types of KGs demonstrate the effectiveness of UniHR and highlight the strong potential of unified representations.

<title>Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair</title>

Abstract: LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa. The source code and experimental results of this work for replication are available at https://github.com/XYZboom/DEVLoRe.

<title>Adapting Chat Language Models Using Only Target Unlabeled Language Data</title>

Abstract: Vocabulary expansion (VE) is the de-facto approach to language adaptation of large language models (LLMs) by adding new tokens and continuing pre-training on target data. While this is effective for base models trained on unlabeled data, it poses challenges for chat models trained to follow instructions through labeled conversation data. Directly adapting the latter with VE on target unlabeled data may result in forgetting chat abilities. While ideal, target chat data is often unavailable or costly to create for low-resource languages, and machine-translated alternatives are not always effective. To address this issue, previous work proposed using a base and chat model from the same family. This method first adapts the base LLM with VE on target unlabeled data and then converts it to a chat model by adding a chat vector (CV) derived from the weight difference between the source base and chat models. We propose ElChat, a new language adaptation method for chat LLMs that adapts a chat model directly on target unlabeled data, without a base model. It elicits chat abilities by injecting information from the source chat model. ElChat offers more robust and competitive target language and safety performance while achieving superior English, chat, and instruction-following abilities compared to CV.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise in software engineering tasks like Fault Localization (FL) and Automatic Program Repair (APR). This study investigates the impact of input order and context size on LLM performance in FL, a crucial step for many downstream software engineering tasks. We test different orders for methods using Kendall Tau distances, including "perfect" (where ground truths come first) and "worst" (where ground truths come last), using two benchmarks that consist of both Java and Python projects. Our results indicate a significant bias in order; Top-1 FL accuracy in Java projects drops from 57% to 20%, while in Python projects, it decreases from 38% to approximately 3% when we reverse the code order. Breaking down inputs into smaller contexts helps reduce this bias, narrowing the performance gap in FL from 22% to 6% and then to just 1% on both benchmarks. We then investigated whether the bias in order was caused by data leakage by renaming the method names with more meaningful alternatives. Our findings indicated that the trend remained consistent, suggesting that the bias was not due to data leakage. We also look at ordering methods based on traditional FL techniques and metrics. Ordering using DepGraph's ranking achieves 48% Top-1 accuracy, which is better than more straightforward ordering approaches like CallGraphDFS. These findings underscore the importance of how we structure inputs, manage contexts, and choose ordering methods to improve LLM performance in FL and other software engineering tasks.

Abstract: Cross-modal (e.g. image-text, video-text) retrieval is an important task in information retrieval and multimodal vision-language understanding field. Temporal understanding makes video-text retrieval more challenging than image-text retrieval. However, we find that the widely used video-text benchmarks have shortcomings in comprehensively assessing abilities of models, especially in temporal understanding, causing large-scale image-text pre-trained models can already achieve comparable zero-shot performance with video-text pre-trained models. In this paper, we introduce RTime, a novel temporal-emphasized video-text retrieval dataset. We first obtain videos of actions or events with significant temporality, and then reverse these videos to create harder negative samples. We then recruit annotators to judge the significance and reversibility of candidate videos, and write captions for qualified videos. We further adopt GPT-4 to extend more captions based on human-written captions. Our RTime dataset currently consists of 21k videos with 10 captions per video, totalling about 122 hours. Based on RTime, we propose three retrieval benchmark tasks: RTime-Origin, RTime-Hard, and RTime-Binary. We further enhance the use of harder-negatives in model training, and benchmark a variety of video-text models on RTime. Extensive experiment analysis proves that RTime indeed poses new and higher challenges to video-text retrieval. We release our RTime dataset https://github.com/qyr0403/Reversed-in-Time to further advance video-text retrieval and multimodal understanding research.

Abstract: Tokenization is the process of encoding strings into tokens of a fixed vocabulary size, and is widely utilized in Natural Language Processing applications. The leading tokenization algorithm today is Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), which formulates the tokenization problem as a compression problem and tackles it by performing sequences of merges. In this work, we formulate tokenization as an optimization objective, show that it is NP-hard via a simple reduction from vertex cover, and propose a polynomial-time greedy algorithm GreedTok. Our formulation naturally relaxes to the well-studied weighted maximum coverage problem which has a simple $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation algorithm GreedWMC. Through empirical evaluations on real-world corpora, we show that GreedTok outperforms BPE and Unigram on compression and achieves a covering score comparable to GreedWMC. Finally, our extensive pre-training for two transformer-based language models with 1 billion parameters, comparing the choices of BPE and GreedTok as the tokenizer, shows that GreedTok achieves a lower bit per byte even when we control for either the total dataset proportion or total training tokens.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of tasks, yet their application to specialized domains remains challenging due to the need for deep expertise. Retrieval-Augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to customize LLMs for professional fields by seamlessly integrating external knowledge bases, enabling real-time access to domain-specific expertise during inference. Despite its potential, traditional RAG systems, based on flat text retrieval, face three critical challenges: (i) complex query understanding in professional contexts, (ii) difficulties in knowledge integration across distributed sources, and (iii) system efficiency bottlenecks at scale. This survey presents a systematic analysis of Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG), a new paradigm that revolutionizes domain-specific LLM applications. GraphRAG addresses traditional RAG limitations through three key innovations: (i) graph-structured knowledge representation that explicitly captures entity relationships and domain hierarchies, (ii) efficient graph-based retrieval techniques that enable context-preserving knowledge retrieval with multihop reasoning ability, and (iii) structure-aware knowledge integration algorithms that leverage retrieved knowledge for accurate and logical coherent generation of LLMs. In this survey, we systematically analyze the technical foundations of GraphRAG and examine current implementations across various professional domains, identifying key technical challenges and promising research directions. All the related resources of GraphRAG, including research papers, open-source data, and projects, are collected for the community in https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/Awesome-GraphRAG.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved remarkable performance recently, and thus model hubs have emerged. Existing model hubs typically assume basic text matching is sufficient to search for models. However, in reality, due to different abstractions and the large number of models in model hubs, it is not easy for users to review model descriptions and example images, choosing which model best meets their needs. Therefore, it is necessary to describe model functionality wisely so that future users can efficiently search for the most suitable model for their needs. Efforts to address this issue remain limited. In this paper, we propose Conditional Generative Model Identification (CGI), which aims to provide an effective way to identify the most suitable model using user-provided example images rather than requiring users to manually review a large number of models with example images. To address this problem, we propose the PromptBased Model Identification (PMI) , which can adequately describe model functionality and precisely match requirements with specifications. To evaluate PMI approach and promote related research, we provide a benchmark comprising 65 models and 9100 identification tasks. Extensive experimental and human evaluation results demonstrate that PMI is effective. For instance, 92% of models are correctly identified with significantly better FID scores when four example images are provided.

<title>Mind the Value-Action Gap: Do LLMs Act in Alignment with Their Values?</title>

Abstract: Existing research primarily evaluates the values of LLMs by examining their stated inclinations towards specific values. However, the "Value-Action Gap," a phenomenon rooted in environmental and social psychology, reveals discrepancies between individuals' stated values and their actions in real-world contexts. To what extent do LLMs exhibit a similar gap between their stated values and their actions informed by those values? This study introduces ValueActionLens, an evaluation framework to assess the alignment between LLMs' stated values and their value-informed actions. The framework encompasses the generation of a dataset comprising 14.8k value-informed actions across twelve cultures and eleven social topics, and two tasks to evaluate how well LLMs' stated value inclinations and value-informed actions align across three different alignment measures. Extensive experiments reveal that the alignment between LLMs' stated values and actions is sub-optimal, varying significantly across scenarios and models. Analysis of misaligned results identifies potential harms from certain value-action gaps. To predict the value-action gaps, we also uncover that leveraging reasoned explanations improves performance. These findings underscore the risks of relying solely on the LLMs' stated values to predict their behaviors and emphasize the importance of context-aware evaluations of LLM values and value-action gaps.

Abstract: Effective traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial in mitigating urban congestion and reducing emissions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several real-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor accuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data transmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions. (2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could be unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP) selection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on TSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting safety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust two-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing and RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It employs fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances the efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during training and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It works in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior performance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results indicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to expert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six real-world datasets with transmission noise. The code and deployment video are available at the URL1

Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a commonly used tool for dimension reduction and denoising. Therefore, it is also widely used on the data prior to training a neural network. However, this approach can complicate the explanation of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods for the decision of the model. In this work, we analyze the potential issues with this approach and propose Principal Components-based Initialization (PCsInit), a strategy to incorporate PCA into the first layer of a neural network via initialization of the first layer in the network with the principal components, and its two variants PCsInit-Act and PCsInit-Sub. We will show that explanations using these strategies are more simple, direct and straightforward than using PCA prior to training a neural network on the principal components. We also show that the proposed techniques possess desirable theoretical properties. Moreover, as will be illustrated in the experiments, such training strategies can also allow further improvement of training via backpropagation compared to training neural networks on principal components.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized text generation but also raised concerns about potential misuse, making detecting LLM-generated text (AI text) increasingly essential. While prior work has focused on identifying AI text and effectively checkmating it, our study investigates a less-explored territory: portraying the nuanced distinctions between human and AI texts across text segments (introduction, body, and conclusion). Whether LLMs excel or falter in incorporating linguistic ingenuity across text segments, the results will critically inform their viability and boundaries as effective creative assistants to humans. Through an analogy with the structure of chess games, comprising opening, middle, and end games, we analyze segment-specific patterns to reveal where the most striking differences lie. Although AI texts closely resemble human writing in the body segment due to its length, deeper analysis shows a higher divergence in features dependent on the continuous flow of language, making it the most informative segment for detection. Additionally, human texts exhibit greater stylistic variation across segments, offering a new lens for distinguishing them from AI. Overall, our findings provide fresh insights into human-AI text differences and pave the way for more effective and interpretable detection strategies.

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) represents a promising paradigm for developing generalist agents that learn at inference time through trial-and-error interactions, analogous to how large language models adapt contextually, but with a focus on reward maximization. However, the scalability of ICRL beyond toy tasks and single-domain settings remains an open challenge. In this work, we present the first steps toward scaling ICRL by introducing a fixed, cross-domain model capable of learning behaviors through in-context reinforcement learning. Our results demonstrate that Algorithm Distillation, a framework designed to facilitate ICRL, offers a compelling and competitive alternative to expert distillation to construct versatile action models. These findings highlight the potential of ICRL as a scalable approach for generalist decision-making systems. Code released at https://github.com/dunnolab/vintix

arXiv:2502.00639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The probabilistic diffusion model (DM), generating content by inferencing through a recursive chain structure, has emerged as a powerful framework for visual generation. After pre-training on enormous data, the model needs to be properly aligned to meet requirements for downstream applications. How to efficiently align the foundation DM is a crucial task. Contemporary methods are either based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) or truncated Backpropagation (BP). However, RL and truncated BP suffer from low sample efficiency and biased gradient estimation, respectively, resulting in limited improvement or, even worse, complete training failure. To overcome the challenges, we propose the Recursive Likelihood Ratio (RLR) optimizer, a Half-Order (HO) fine-tuning paradigm for DM. The HO gradient estimator enables the computation graph rearrangement within the recursive diffusive chain, making the RLR's gradient estimator an unbiased one with lower variance than other methods. We theoretically investigate the bias, variance, and convergence of our method. Extensive experiments are conducted on image and video generation to validate the superiority of the RLR. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt technique that is natural for the RLR to achieve a synergistic effect.

Abstract: Neural network-based optimal transport (OT) is a recent and fruitful direction in the generative modeling community. It finds its applications in various fields such as domain translation, image super-resolution, computational biology and others. Among the existing OT approaches, of considerable interest are adversarial minimax solvers based on semi-dual formulations of OT problems. While promising, these methods lack theoretical investigation from a statistical learning perspective. Our work fills this gap by establishing upper bounds on the generalization error of an approximate OT map recovered by the minimax quadratic OT solver. Importantly, the bounds we derive depend solely on some standard statistical and mathematical properties of the considered functional classes (neural nets). While our analysis focuses on the quadratic OT, we believe that similar bounds could be derived for general OT case, paving the promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive, highly accessible, and cost-effective approach for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, existing methods, whether based on handcrafted feature engineering or standard deep learning, face two major challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale EEG-AD datasets for robust representation learning, and 2) the absence of a dedicated deep learning pipeline for subject-level detection, which is more clinically meaningful than the commonly used sample-level detection. To address these gaps, we have curated the world's largest EEG-AD corpus to date, comprising 2,255 subjects. Leveraging this unique data corpus, we propose LEAD, the first large-scale foundation model for EEG analysis in dementia. Our approach provides an innovative framework for subject-level AD detection, including: 1) a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline such as artifact removal, resampling, and filtering, and a newly proposed multi-scale segmentation strategy, 2) a subject-regularized spatio-temporal transformer trained with a novel subject-level cross-entropy loss and an indices group-shuffling algorithm, and 3) AD-guided contrastive pre-training. We pre-train on 12 datasets (3 AD-related and 9 non-AD) and fine-tune/test on 4 AD datasets. Compared with 10 baselines, LEAD consistently obtains superior subject-level detection performance under the challenging subject-independent cross-validation protocol. On the benchmark ADFTD dataset, our model achieves an impressive subject-level Sensitivity of 90.91% under the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) setting. These results strongly validate the effectiveness of our method for real-world EEG-based AD detection. Source code: https://github.com/DL4mHealth/LEAD

Abstract: Mobility performance has been a key focus in cellular networks up to 5G. To enhance handover (HO) performance, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handover (CHO) and Layer 1/Layer 2 Triggered Mobility (LTM) mechanisms in 5G. While these reactive HO strategies address the trade-off between HO failures (HOF) and ping-pong effects, they often result in inefficient radio resource utilization due to additional HO preparations. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a proactive HO framework for mobility management in O-RAN, leveraging user-cell link predictions to identify the optimal target cell for HO. We explore various categories of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for link prediction and analyze the complexity of applying them to the mobility management domain. Two GNN models are compared using a real-world dataset, with experimental results demonstrating their ability to capture the dynamic and graph-structured nature of cellular networks. Finally, we present key insights from our study and outline future steps to enable the integration of GNN-based link prediction for mobility management in O-RAN networks.

Abstract: Head computed tomography (CT) imaging is a widely-used imaging modality with multitudes of medical indications, particularly in assessing pathology of the brain, skull, and cerebrovascular system. It is commonly the first-line imaging in neurologic emergencies given its rapidity of image acquisition, safety, cost, and ubiquity. Deep learning models may facilitate detection of a wide range of diseases. However, the scarcity of high-quality labels and annotations, particularly among less common conditions, significantly hinders the development of powerful models. To address this challenge, we introduce FM-CT: a Foundation Model for Head CT for generalizable disease detection, trained using self-supervised learning. Our approach pre-trains a deep learning model on a large, diverse dataset of 361,663 non-contrast 3D head CT scans without the need for manual annotations, enabling the model to learn robust, generalizable features. To investigate the potential of self-supervised learning in head CT, we employed both discrimination with self-distillation and masked image modeling, and we construct our model in 3D rather than at the slice level (2D) to exploit the structure of head CT scans more comprehensively and efficiently. The model's downstream classification performance is evaluated using internal and three external datasets, encompassing both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results demonstrate that the self-supervised foundation model significantly improves performance on downstream diagnostic tasks compared to models trained from scratch and previous 3D CT foundation models on scarce annotated datasets. This work highlights the effectiveness of self-supervised learning in medical imaging and sets a new benchmark for head CT image analysis in 3D, enabling broader use of artificial intelligence for head CT-based diagnosis.

<title>Towards Large-Scale In-Context Reinforcement Learning by Meta-Training in Randomized Worlds</title>

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) enables agents to learn automatically and on-the-fly from their interactive experiences. However, a major challenge in scaling up ICRL is the lack of scalable task collections. To address this, we propose the procedurally generated tabular Markov Decision Processes, named AnyMDP. Through a carefully designed randomization process, AnyMDP is capable of generating high-quality tasks on a large scale while maintaining relatively low structural biases. To facilitate efficient meta-training at scale, we further introduce decoupled policy distillation and induce prior information in the ICRL framework. Our results demonstrate that, with a sufficiently large scale of AnyMDP tasks, the proposed model can generalize to tasks that were not considered in the training set through versatile in-context learning paradigms. The scalable task set provided by AnyMDP also enables a more thorough empirical investigation of the relationship between data distribution and ICRL performance. We further show that the generalization of ICRL potentially comes at the cost of increased task diversity and longer adaptation periods. This finding carries critical implications for scaling robust ICRL capabilities, highlighting the necessity of diverse and extensive task design, and prioritizing asymptotic performance over few-shot adaptation.

<title>UltraIF: Advancing Instruction Following from the Wild</title>

Abstract: Instruction-following made modern large language models (LLMs) helpful assistants. However, the key to taming LLMs on complex instructions remains mysterious, for that there are huge gaps between models trained by open-source community and those trained by leading companies. To bridge the gap, we propose a simple and scalable approach UltraIF for building LLMs that can follow complex instructions with open-source data. UltraIF first decomposes real-world user prompts into simpler queries, constraints, and corresponding evaluation questions for the constraints. Then, we train an UltraComposer to compose constraint-associated prompts with evaluation questions. This prompt composer allows us to synthesize complicated instructions as well as filter responses with evaluation questions. In our experiment, for the first time, we successfully align LLaMA-3.1-8B-Base to catch up with its instruct version on 5 instruction-following benchmarks without any benchmark information, using only 8B model as response generator and evaluator. The aligned model also achieved competitive scores on other benchmarks. Moreover, we also show that UltraIF could further improve LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct through self-alignment, motivating broader use cases for the method. Our code is available at https://github.com/kkk-an/UltraIF.

<title>Confidence Improves Self-Consistency in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Self-consistency decoding enhances LLMs' performance on reasoning tasks by sampling diverse reasoning paths and selecting the most frequent answer. However, it is computationally expensive, as sampling many of these (lengthy) paths is required to increase the chances that the correct answer emerges as the most frequent one. To address this, we introduce Confidence-Informed Self-Consistency (CISC). CISC performs a weighted majority vote based on confidence scores obtained directly from the model. By prioritizing high-confidence paths, it can identify the correct answer with a significantly smaller sample size. When tested on nine models and four datasets, CISC outperforms self-consistency in nearly all configurations, reducing the required number of reasoning paths by over 40% on average. In addition, we introduce the notion of within-question confidence evaluation, after showing that standard evaluation methods are poor predictors of success in distinguishing correct and incorrect answers to the same question. In fact, the most calibrated confidence method proved to be the least effective for CISC. Lastly, beyond these practical implications, our results and analyses show that LLMs can effectively judge the correctness of their own outputs, contributing to the ongoing debate on this topic.

<title>OrderFusion: Encoding Orderbook for End-to-End Probabilistic Intraday Electricity Price Forecasting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06830</link>

arXiv:2502.06830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of intraday electricity prices is essential to manage market uncertainties. However, current methods rely heavily on domain feature extraction, which breaks the end-to-end training pipeline and limits the model's ability to learn expressive representations from the raw orderbook. Moreover, these methods often require training separate models for different quantiles, further violating the end-to-end principle and introducing the quantile crossing issue. Recent advances in time-series models have demonstrated promising performance in general forecasting tasks. However, these models lack inductive biases arising from buy-sell interactions and are thus overparameterized. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end probabilistic model called OrderFusion, which produces interaction-aware representations of buy-sell dynamics, hierarchically estimates multiple quantiles, and remains parameter-efficient with only 4,872 parameters. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on price indices (ID1, ID2, and ID3) using three years of orderbook in high-liquidity (German) and low-liquidity (Austrian) markets. The experimental results demonstrate that OrderFusion consistently outperforms multiple competitive baselines across markets, and ablation studies highlight the contribution of its individual components.

Abstract: Time series modeling and analysis have become critical in various domains. Conventional methods such as RNNs and Transformers, while effective for discrete-time and regularly sampled data, face significant challenges in capturing the continuous dynamics and irregular sampling patterns inherent in real-world scenarios. Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) represent a paradigm shift by combining the flexibility of neural networks with the mathematical rigor of differential equations. This paper presents a comprehensive review of NDE-based methods for time series analysis, including neural ordinary differential equations, neural controlled differential equations, and neural stochastic differential equations. We provide a detailed discussion of their mathematical formulations, numerical methods, and applications, highlighting their ability to model continuous-time dynamics. Furthermore, we address key challenges and future research directions. This survey serves as a foundation for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage NDEs for advanced time series analysis.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting is crucial for real-world spatiotemporal systems, such as climate, energy, and urban environments, where quantifying uncertainty is essential for informed, risk-aware decision-making. While diffusion models have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions, their application to spatiotemporal forecasting remains limited due to complex spatiotemporal dynamics and high computational demands. we propose CoST, a general forecasting framework that collaborates deterministic and diffusion models for diverse spatiotemporal systems. CoST formulates a mean-residual decomposition strategy: it leverages a powerful deterministic model to capture the conditional mean and a lightweight diffusion model to learn residual uncertainties. This collaborative formulation simplifies learning objectives, improves accuracy and efficiency, and generalizes across diverse spatiotemporal systems. To address spatial heterogeneity, we further design a scale-aware diffusion mechanism to guide the diffusion process. Extensive experiments across ten real-world datasets from climate, energy, communication, and urban systems show that CoST achieves 25\% performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly reducing computational cost.

<title>PAFT: Prompt-Agnostic Fine-Tuning</title>

arXiv:2502.12859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often causes overfitting to specific prompt wording, where minor phrasing variations drastically reduce performance. To address this, we propose Prompt-Agnostic Fine-Tuning (PAFT), a method that enhances robustness through dynamic prompt variation during training. PAFT first generates diverse synthetic prompts, then continuously samples from this set to construct training instances, forcing models to learn fundamental task principles rather than surface-level patterns. Across systematic evaluations using both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT), PAFT demonstrates substantially improved prompt robustness, achieving 7% higher generalization accuracy on unseen prompts than standard methods. In addition to enhanced robustness, PAFT consistently yields superior overall performance on established benchmarks for question answering, mathematical reasoning, and tool use. Notably, models trained with PAFT attain 3.2 faster inference speeds due to reduced prompt sensitivity. Ablation studies further validate effectiveness of PAFT, while theoretical analysis reveals that PAFT can effectively enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of LLM.

<title>B-cos LM: Efficiently Transforming Pre-trained Language Models for Improved Explainability</title>

arXiv:2502.12992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-hoc explanation methods for black-box models often struggle with faithfulness and human interpretability due to the lack of explainability in current neural architectures. Meanwhile, B-cos networks have been introduced to improve model explainability by proposing an architecture that removes bias terms and promotes input-weight alignment. Although B-cos networks have shown success in building explainable systems, their application has so far been limited to computer vision models and their associated training pipelines. In this work, we introduce B-cos LMs, i.e., B-cos language models (LMs) empowered for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Our approach directly transforms pre-trained language models into B-cos LMs by combining B-cos conversion and task fine-tuning, improving efficiency compared to previous methods. Our automatic and human evaluation results demonstrate that B-cos LMs produce more faithful and human interpretable explanations than post-hoc methods, while maintaining task performance comparable to conventional fine-tuning. Our in-depth analysis explores how B-cos LMs differ from conventionally fine-tuned models in their learning processes and explanation patterns. Finally, we present a first exploration of transforming decoder-only models to B-cos LMs for generation tasks.

<title>Mitigating Barren Plateaus in Quantum Neural Networks via an AI-Driven Submartingale-Based Framework</title>

arXiv:2502.13166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for various applications, yet their training is often hindered by barren plateaus (BPs), where gradient variance vanishes exponentially in terms of the qubit size. Most existing initialization-based mitigation strategies rely heavily on pre-designed static parameter distributions, thereby lacking adaptability to diverse model sizes or data conditions. To address these limitations, we propose AdaInit, a foundational framework that leverages generative models with the submartingale property to iteratively synthesize initial parameters for QNNs that yield non-negligible gradient variance, thereby mitigating BPs. Unlike conventional one-shot initialization methods, AdaInit adaptively explores the parameter space by incorporating dataset characteristics and gradient feedback, with theoretical guarantees of convergence to finding a set of effective initial parameters for QNNs. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses of the submartingale-based process and empirically validate that AdaInit consistently outperforms existing initialization methods in maintaining higher gradient variance across various QNN scales. We believe this work may initiate a new avenue to mitigate BPs.

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal content on social media presents significant challenges in understanding and moderating complex, context-dependent issues such as misinformation, hate speech, and propaganda. While efforts have been made to develop resources and propose new methods for automatic detection, limited attention has been given to jointly modeling label detection and the generation of explanation-based rationales, which often leads to degraded classification performance when trained simultaneously. To address this challenge, we introduce MemeXplain, an explanation-enhanced dataset for propagandistic memes in Arabic and hateful memes in English, making it the first large-scale resource for these tasks. To solve these tasks, we propose a multi-stage optimization approach and train Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our results show that this strategy significantly improves both label detection and explanation generation quality over the base model, outperforming the current state-of-the-art with an absolute improvement of ~1.4% (Acc) on ArMeme and ~2.2% (Acc) on Hateful Memes. For reproducibility and future research, we aim to make the MemeXplain dataset and scripts publicly available (https://github.com/MohamedBayan/MemeIntel).

Abstract: We consider multi-dimensional payoff functions in partially observable Markov decision processes. We study the structure of the set of expected payoff vectors of all strategies (policies) and study what kind are needed to achieve a given expected payoff vector. In general, pure strategies (i.e., not resorting to randomisation) do not suffice for this problem.
  We prove that for any payoff for which the expectation is well-defined under all strategies, it is sufficient to mix (i.e., randomly select a pure strategy at the start of a play and committing to it for the rest of the play) finitely many pure strategies to approximate any expected payoff vector up to any precision. Furthermore, for any payoff for which the expected payoff is finite under all strategies, any expected payoff can be obtained exactly by mixing finitely many strategies.

<title>SRA-CL: Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2503.04162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has shown effectiveness in improving sequential recommendation models. However, existing methods still face challenges in generating high-quality contrastive pairs: they either rely on random perturbations that corrupt user preference patterns or depend on sparse collaborative data that generates unreliable contrastive pairs. Furthermore, existing approaches typically require predefined selection rules that impose strong assumptions, limiting the model's ability to autonomously learn optimal contrastive pairs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning (SRA-CL). SRA-CL leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to generate expressive embeddings that capture both user preferences and item characteristics. These semantic embeddings enable the construction of candidate pools for inter-user and intra-user contrastive learning through semantic-based retrieval. To further enhance the quality of the contrastive samples, we introduce a learnable sample synthesizer that optimizes the contrastive sample generation process during model training. SRA-CL adopts a plug-and-play design, enabling seamless integration with existing sequential recommendation architectures. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and model-agnostic nature of our approach.

arXiv:2503.07338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Occupancy World Models (OWMs) aim to predict future scenes via 3D voxelized representations of the environment to support intelligent motion planning. Existing approaches typically generate full future occupancy states from VAE-style latent encodings, which can be computationally expensive and redundant. We propose Delta-Triplane Transformers (DTT), a novel 4D OWM for autonomous driving, that introduces two key innovations: (1) a triplane based representation that encodes 3D occupancy more compactly than previous approaches, and (2) an incremental prediction strategy for OWM that models {\em changes} in occupancy rather than dealing with full states. The core insight is that changes in the compact 3D latent space are naturally sparser and easier to model, enabling higher accuracy with a lighter-weight architecture. Building on this representation, DTT extracts multi-scale motion features from historical data and iteratively predict future triplane deltas. These deltas are combined with past states to decode future occupancy and ego-motion trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTT delivers a 1.44$\times$ speedup (26 FPS) over the state of the art, improves mean IoU to 30.85, and reduces the mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters. Demo videos are provided in the supplementary material.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in fundamental cross-modality research, demonstrating significant potential in both image understanding and generation. However, existing research in the face domain primarily faces two challenges: $\textbf{(1)}$ $\textbf{fragmentation development}$, with existing methods failing to unify understanding and generation into a single one, hindering the way to artificial general intelligence. $\textbf{(2) lack of fine-grained facial attributes}$, which are crucial for high-fidelity applications. To handle those issues, we propose $\textbf{UniF$^2$ace}$, $\textit{the first UMM specifically tailored for fine-grained face understanding and generation}$. $\textbf{First}$, we introduce a novel theoretical framework with a Dual Discrete Diffusion (D3Diff) loss, unifying masked generative models with discrete score matching diffusion and leading to a more precise approximation of the negative log-likelihood. Moreover, this D3Diff significantly enhances the model's ability to synthesize high-fidelity facial details aligned with text input. $\textbf{Second}$, we propose a multi-level grouped Mixture-of-Experts architecture, adaptively incorporating the semantic and identity facial embeddings to complement the attribute forgotten phenomenon in representation evolvement. $\textbf{Finally}$, to this end, we construct UniF$^2$aceD-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 130K fine-grained image-caption pairs and 1M visual question-answering pairs, spanning a much wider range of facial attributes than existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniF$^2$ace outperforms existing models with a similar scale in both understanding and generation tasks, with 7.1\% higher Desc-GPT and 6.6\% higher VQA-score, respectively.

arXiv:2503.09598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in diverse scenarios, the extent to which they could tacitly spread misinformation emerges as a critical safety concern. Current research primarily evaluates LLMs on explicit false statements, overlooking how misinformation often manifests subtly as unchallenged premises in real-world interactions. We curated EchoMist, the first comprehensive benchmark for implicit misinformation, where false assumptions are embedded in the query to LLMs. EchoMist targets circulated, harmful, and ever-evolving implicit misinformation from diverse sources, including realistic human-AI conversations and social media interactions. Through extensive empirical studies on 15 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that current models perform alarmingly poorly on this task, often failing to detect false premises and generating counterfactual explanations. We also investigate two mitigation methods, i.e., Self-Alert and RAG, to enhance LLMs' capability to counter implicit misinformation. Our findings indicate that EchoMist remains a persistent challenge and underscore the critical need to safeguard against the risk of implicit misinformation.

Abstract: Implicit biases refer to automatic mental processes that shape perceptions, judgments, and behaviors. Previous research on "implicit bias'' in LLMs focused primarily on outputs rather than the processes underlying the outputs. We present the Reasoning Model Implicit Association Test (RM-IAT) to study implicit bias-like processing in reasoning models, which are LLMs that use step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks. Using RM-IAT, we find that reasoning models like o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, gpt-oss-20b, and Qwen-3 8B consistently expend more reasoning tokens on association-incompatible tasks than association-compatible tasks, suggesting greater computational effort when processing counter-stereotypical information. In contrast, Claude 3.7 Sonnet exhibited reversed or inconsistent patterns, likely due to embedded safety mechanisms that flagged or rejected socially sensitive associations. These divergent behaviors highlight important differences in how alignment and safety processes shape model reasoning. As reasoning models become increasingly integrated into real-world decision-making, understanding their implicit bias-like patterns and how alignment methods influence them is crucial for ensuring fair and trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in robotic systems remains a fundamental challenge, especially when deploying offline policy-learning methods such as imitation learning in dynamic environments. Traditional behavior cloning (BC) often fails to generalize when deployed without fine-tuning as it does not account for disturbances in observations that arises in real-world, changing environments. To address this limitation, we propose RISE (Robust Imitation through Stochastic Encodings), a novel imitation-learning framework that explicitly addresses erroneous measurements of environment parameters into policy learning via a variational latent representation. Our framework encodes parameters such as obstacle state, orientation, and velocity into a smooth variational latent space to improve test time generalization. This enables an offline-trained policy to produce actions that are more robust to perceptual noise and environment uncertainty. We validate our approach on two robotic platforms, an autonomous ground vehicle and a Franka Emika Panda manipulator and demonstrate improved safety robustness while maintaining goal-reaching performance compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: The success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) critically depends on the quality of the reward model. However, while this quality is primarily evaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures what makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from an optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a reward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective suffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward model can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate models that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward model that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance, and thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a fundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or independently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up to 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between reward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate. Overall, our findings highlight that beyond accuracy, a reward model needs to induce sufficient variance for efficient~optimization.

Abstract: Bilevel reinforcement learning (BRL) has emerged as a powerful framework for aligning generative models, yet its theoretical foundations, especially sample complexity bounds, remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first sample complexity bound for BRL, establishing a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ in continuous state-action spaces. Traditional MDP analysis techniques do not extend to BRL due to its nested structure and non-convex lower-level problems. We overcome these challenges by leveraging the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition and the MDP structure to obtain closed-form gradients, enabling tight sample complexity analysis. Our analysis also extends to general bi-level optimization settings with non-convex lower levels, where we achieve state-of-the-art sample complexity results of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ improving upon existing bounds of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-6})$. Additionally, we address the computational bottleneck of hypergradient estimation by proposing a fully first-order, Hessian-free algorithm suitable for large-scale problems.

Abstract: Compute scaling for language model (LM) pretraining has outpaced the growth of human-written texts, leading to concerns that data will become the bottleneck to LM scaling. To continue scaling pretraining in this data-constrained regime, we propose that explicitly modeling and inferring the \emph{latent thoughts} that underlie the text generation process can significantly improve pretraining data efficiency. Intuitively, our approach views web text as the compressed final outcome of a verbose human thought process and that the latent thoughts contain important contextual knowledge and reasoning steps that are critical to data-efficient learning. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through data-constrained continued pretraining for math. We first show that synthetic data approaches to inferring latent thoughts significantly improve data efficiency over training on the same amount of raw data. Furthermore, we demonstrate latent thought inference without a strong teacher, where an LM \emph{bootstraps its own performance} by using an EM algorithm to iteratively improve the capability of the trained LM and the quality of thought-augmented pretraining data. We show that a 1B LM can bootstrap its performance across at least three iterations and significantly outperform baselines trained on raw data, with increasing gains from additional inference compute when performing the E-step. The gains from inference scaling and EM iterations suggest new opportunities for scaling data-constrained pretraining.

Abstract: Audio often serves as an auxiliary modality in video understanding tasks of audio-visual large language models (LLMs), merely assisting in the comprehension of visual information. However, a thorough understanding of videos significantly depends on auditory information, as audio offers critical context, emotional cues, and semantic meaning that visual data alone often lacks. This paper proposes an audio-centric video understanding benchmark (AVUT) to evaluate the video comprehension capabilities of multimodal LLMs with a particular focus on auditory information. AVUT introduces a suite of carefully designed audio-centric tasks, holistically testing the understanding of both audio content and audio-visual interactions in videos. Moreover, this work points out the text shortcut problem that largely exists in other benchmarks where the correct answer can be found from question text alone without needing videos. AVUT addresses this problem by proposing a answer permutation-based filtering mechanism. A thorough evaluation across a diverse range of open-source and proprietary multimodal LLMs is performed, followed by the analyses of deficiencies in audio-visual LLMs. Demos and data are available at https://github.com/lark-png/AVUT.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising approach for unifying independently fine-tuned models into an integrated framework, significantly enhancing computational efficiency in multi-task learning. Recently, several SVD-based techniques have been introduced to exploit low-rank structures for enhanced merging, but their reliance on such manually designed rank selection often leads to cross-task interference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose AdaRank, a novel model merging framework that adaptively selects the most beneficial singular directions of task vectors to merge multiple models. We empirically show that the dominant singular components of task vectors can cause critical interference with other tasks, and that naive truncation across tasks and layers degrades performance. In contrast, AdaRank dynamically prunes the singular components that cause interference and offers an optimal amount of information to each task vector by learning to prune ranks during test-time via entropy minimization. Our analysis demonstrates that such method mitigates detrimental overlaps among tasks, while empirical results show that AdaRank consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with various backbones and number of tasks, reducing the performance gap between fine-tuned models to nearly 1%.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing by learning from massive datasets, yet this rapid progress has also drawn legal scrutiny, as the ability to unintentionally generate copyrighted content has already prompted several prominent lawsuits. In this work, we introduce SUV (Selective Unlearning for Verbatim data), a selective unlearning framework designed to prevent LLM from memorizing copyrighted content while preserving its overall utility. In detail, the proposed method constructs a dataset that captures instances of copyrighted infringement cases by the targeted LLM. With the dataset, we unlearn the content from the LLM by means of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which replaces the verbatim copyrighted content with plausible and coherent alternatives. Since DPO may hinder the LLM's performance in other unrelated tasks, we integrate gradient projection and Fisher information regularization to mitigate the degradation. We validate our approach using a large-scale dataset of 500 famous books (predominantly copyrighted works) and demonstrate that SUV significantly reduces verbatim memorization with negligible impact on the performance on unrelated tasks. Extensive experiments on both our dataset and public benchmarks confirm the scalability and efficacy of our approach, offering a promising solution for mitigating copyright risks in real-world LLM applications.

Abstract: Cross-lingual open-ended generation - responding in a language different from that of the query - is an important yet understudied problem. This work proposes XL-Instruct, a novel technique for generating high-quality synthetic data, and introduces XL-AlpacaEval, a new benchmark for evaluating cross-lingual generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Our experiments show that fine-tuning with just 8K instructions generated using XL-Instruct significantly improves model performance, increasing the win rate against GPT-4o-Mini from 7.4% to 21.5% and improving on several fine-grained quality metrics. Moreover, base LLMs fine-tuned on XL-Instruct exhibit strong zero-shot improvements to question answering in the same language, as shown on our machine-translated m-AlpacaEval. These consistent gains highlight the promising role of XL-Instruct in the post-training of multilingual LLMs. Finally, we publicly release XL-Suite, a collection of training and evaluation data to facilitate research in cross-lingual open-ended generation.

<title>Beyond Synthetic Replays: Turning Diffusion Features into Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning Knowledge</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2503.23402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely limited training data while requiring models to acquire new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. Recent works have explored generative models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), to address these challenges. However, existing approaches use SD mainly as a replay generator, whereas we demonstrate that SD's rich multi-scale representations can serve as a unified backbone. Motivated by this observation, we introduce Diffusion-FSCIL, which extracts four synergistic feature types from SD by capturing real image characteristics through inversion, providing semantic diversity via class-conditioned synthesis, enhancing generalization through controlled noise injection, and enabling replay without image storage through generative features. Unlike conventional approaches requiring synthetic buffers and separate classification backbones, our unified framework operates entirely in the latent space with only lightweight networks ($\approx$6M parameters). Extensive experiments on CUB-200, miniImageNet, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with comprehensive ablations confirming the necessity of each feature type. Furthermore, we confirm that our streamlined variant maintains competitive accuracy while substantially improving efficiency, establishing the viability of generative models as practical and effective backbones for FSCIL.

<title>SentenceKV: Efficient LLM Inference via Sentence-Level Semantic KV Caching</title>

arXiv:2504.00970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models face significant computational and memory challenges when processing long contexts. During inference, efficient management of the key-value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate activations for autoregressive generation, is critical to reducing memory overhead and improving computational efficiency. Traditional token-level efficient KV caching methods overlook semantic information, treating tokens independently without considering their semantic relationships. Meanwhile, existing semantic-preserving KV cache management approaches often suffer from substantial memory usage and high time-to-first-token. To address these limitations, we propose SentenceKV, a novel sentence-level semantic KV caching approach designed to enhance inference efficiency while preserving semantic coherence. During prefilling, SentenceKV groups tokens based on sentence-level semantic similarity, compressing sentence representations into concise semantic vectors stored directly on the GPU, while individual KV pairs are offloaded to CPU. During decoding, SentenceKV generates tokens by selectively retrieving semantically relevant sentence-level KV entries, leveraging the semantic similarity between the prefilling-stage semantic vectors and decoding-stage queries. This ensures efficient and contextually accurate predictions, minimizing the loading of redundant or irrelevant data into GPU memory and significantly reducing memory overhead while maintaining stable inference latency, even for extremely long contexts. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including PG-19, LongBench, and Needle-In-A-Haystack demonstrate that SentenceKV significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and memory usage, without compromising model accuracy.

<title>SCRAMBLe : Enhancing Multimodal LLM Compositionality with Synthetic Preference Data</title>

Abstract: Compositionality, or correctly recognizing scenes as compositions of atomic visual concepts, remains difficult for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Even state of the art MLLMs such as GPT-4o can make mistakes in distinguishing compositions like "dog chasing cat" vs "cat chasing dog". While on Winoground, a benchmark for measuring such reasoning, MLLMs have made significant progress, they are still far from a human's performance. We show that compositional reasoning in these models can be improved by elucidating such concepts via data, where a model is trained to prefer the correct caption for an image over a close but incorrect one. We introduce SCRAMBLe: Synthetic Compositional Reasoning Augmentation of MLLMs with Binary preference Learning, an approach for preference tuning open-weight MLLMs on synthetic preference data generated in a fully automated manner from existing image-caption data. SCRAMBLe holistically improves these MLLMs' compositional reasoning capabilities which we can see through significant improvements across multiple vision language compositionality benchmarks, as well as smaller but significant improvements on general question answering tasks. As a sneak peek, SCRAMBLe tuned Molmo-7B model improves on Winoground from 49.5% to 54.8% (best reported to date), while improving by ~1% on more general visual question answering tasks. Code for SCRAMBLe along with tuned models and our synthetic training dataset is available at https://github.com/samarth4149/SCRAMBLe.

<title>From Specificity to Generality: Revisiting Generalizable Artifacts in Detecting Face Deepfakes</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04827</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.04827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting deepfakes has been an increasingly important topic, especially given the rapid development of AI generation techniques. In this paper, we ask: How can we build a universal detection framework that is effective for most facial deepfakes? One significant challenge is the wide variety of deepfake generators available, resulting in varying forgery artifacts (e.g., lighting inconsistency, color mismatch, etc). But should we ``teach" the detector to learn all these artifacts separately? It is impossible and impractical to elaborate on them all. So the core idea is to pinpoint the more common and general artifacts across different deepfakes. Accordingly, we categorize deepfake artifacts into two distinct yet complementary types: Face Inconsistency Artifacts (FIA) and Up-Sampling Artifacts (USA). FIA arise from the challenge of generating all intricate details, inevitably causing inconsistencies between the complex facial features and relatively uniform surrounding areas. USA, on the other hand, are the inevitable traces left by the generator's decoder during the up-sampling process. This categorization stems from the observation that all existing deepfakes typically exhibit one or both of these artifacts. To achieve this, we propose a new data-level pseudo-fake creation framework that constructs fake samples with only the FIA and USA, without introducing extra less-general artifacts. Specifically, we employ a super-resolution to simulate the USA, while design a Blender module that uses image-level self-blending on diverse facial regions to create the FIA. We surprisingly found that, with this intuitive design, a standard image classifier trained only with our pseudo-fake data can non-trivially generalize well to unseen deepfakes.

Abstract: Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing the performance of neural networks in computer vision, particularly as architectures become more complex. This work explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning a parameter-efficient version of Code Llama using LoRA. The resulting model produces accurate and computationally efficient hyperparameter recommendations across a wide range of vision architectures. Unlike traditional methods such as Optuna, which rely on resource-intensive trial-and-error procedures, our approach achieves competitive or superior Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while substantially reducing computational overhead. Importantly, the models evaluated span image-centric tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation, fundamental components in many image manipulation pipelines including enhancement, restoration, and style transfer. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based optimization not only rivals established Bayesian methods like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE), but also accelerates tuning for real-world applications requiring perceptual quality and low-latency processing. All generated configurations are publicly available in the LEMUR Neural Network Dataset (https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-dataset), which serves as an open source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research and provides a practical resource to improve training efficiency in image manipulation systems.

Abstract: This study explores the performance of the random Gaussian smoothing Zeroth-Order ExtraGradient (ZO-EG) scheme considering \Af{deterministic} min-max optimisation problems with possibly NonConvex-NonConcave (NC-NC) objective functions. We consider both unconstrained and constrained, differentiable and non-differentiable settings. We discuss the min-max problem from the point of view of variational inequalities. For the unconstrained problem, we establish the convergence of the ZO-EG algorithm to the neighbourhood of an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the NC-NC objective function, whose radius can be controlled under a variance reduction scheme, along with its complexity. For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of proximal variational inequalities and give examples of functions satisfying this property. Moreover, we prove analogous results to the unconstrained case for the constrained problem. For the non-differentiable case, we prove the convergence of the ZO-EG algorithm to a neighbourhood of an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the smoothed version of the objective function, where the radius of the neighbourhood can be controlled, which can be related to the ($\delta,\epsilon$)-Goldstein stationary point of the original objective function.

arXiv:2504.10188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models face a fundamental challenge: they must simultaneously learn high-level semantic concepts (what to generate) and low-level synthesis details (how to generate it). Conventional end-to-end training entangles these distinct, and often conflicting objectives, leading to a complex and inefficient optimization process. We argue that explicitly decoupling these tasks is key to unlocking more effective and efficient generative modeling. To this end, we propose Embedded Representation Warmup (ERW), a principled two-phase training framework. The first phase is dedicated to building a robust semantic foundation by aligning the early layers of a diffusion model with a powerful pretrained encoder. This provides a strong representational prior, allowing the second phase -- generative full training with alignment loss to refine the representation -- to focus its resources on high-fidelity synthesis. Our analysis confirms that this efficacy stems from functionally specializing the model's early layers for representation. Empirically, our framework achieves a 11.5$\times$ speedup in 350 epochs to reach FID=1.41 compared to single-phase methods like REPA. Code is available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/ERW.

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable progress in solving complex and logic-intensive tasks by generating extended Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) prior to arriving at a final answer. Yet, the emergence of this "slow-thinking" paradigm, with numerous tokens generated in sequence, inevitably introduces substantial computational overhead. To this end, it highlights an urgent need for effective acceleration. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in efficient reasoning. It categorizes existing works into three key directions: (1) shorter - compressing lengthy CoTs into concise yet effective reasoning chains; (2) smaller - developing compact language models with strong reasoning capabilities through techniques such as knowledge distillation, other model compression techniques, and reinforcement learning; and (3) faster - designing efficient decoding strategies to accelerate inference of reasoning models. A curated collection of papers discussed in this survey is available in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/fscdc/Awesome-Efficient-Reasoning-Models.

Abstract: Intellectual Property (IP) is a highly specialized domain that integrates technical and legal knowledge, making it inherently complex and knowledge-intensive. Recent advancements in LLMs have demonstrated their potential to handle IP-related tasks, enabling more efficient analysis, understanding, and generation of IP-related content. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus narrowly on patents or cover limited aspects of the IP field, lacking alignment with real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce IPBench, the first comprehensive IP task taxonomy and a large-scale bilingual benchmark encompassing 8 IP mechanisms and 20 distinct tasks, designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world IP scenarios. We benchmark 17 main LLMs, ranging from general purpose to domain-specific, including chat-oriented and reasoning-focused models, under zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought settings. Our results show that even the top-performing model, DeepSeek-V3, achieves only 75.8% accuracy, indicating significant room for improvement. Notably, open-source IP and law-oriented models lag behind closed-source general-purpose models. To foster future research, we publicly release IPBench, and will expand it with additional tasks to better reflect real-world complexities and support model advancements in the IP domain. We provide the data and code in the supplementary URLs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning language models (LRLMs) rely on test-time scaling, which extends long chain-of-thought (CoT) generation to solve complex tasks. However, overthinking in long CoT not only slows down the efficiency of problem solving, but also risks accuracy loss due to the extremely detailed or redundant reasoning steps. We propose a simple yet effective method that allows LLMs to self-truncate CoT sequences by early exit during generation. Instead of relying on fixed heuristics, the proposed method monitors model behavior at potential reasoning transition points and dynamically terminates the next reasoning chain's generation when the model exhibits high confidence in a trial answer. Our method requires no additional training and can be seamlessly integrated into existing o1-like reasoning LLMs. Experiments on 10 reasoning benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K, MATH-500, AMC, GPQA, AIME and LiveCodeBench) show that the proposed method is consistently effective on 11 cutting-edge reasoning LLMs of varying series and sizes, reducing the length of CoT sequences by an average of 19.1% to 80.1% while improving accuracy by 0.3% to 5.0%.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs. Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation. EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50 times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks, yet they struggle to produce truly creative, diverse ideas. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that enhances LLM creativity. We apply LLMs for translating between natural language and structured representations, and perform the core creative leap via cognitively inspired manipulations on these representations. Our notion of creativity goes beyond superficial token-level variations; rather, we recombine structured representations of existing ideas, enabling our system to effectively explore a more abstract landscape of ideas. We demonstrate our approach in the culinary domain with DishCOVER, a model that generates creative recipes. Experiments and domain-expert evaluations reveal that our outputs, which are mostly coherent and feasible, significantly surpass GPT-4o in terms of novelty and diversity, thus outperforming it in creative generation. We hope our work inspires further research into structured creativity in AI.

Abstract: Humans and intelligent animals can internalize new information and accurately internalize their implications to perform downstream tasks. While large language models (LLMs) can achieve this through in-context learning (ICL) when the information (news) is explicitly given as context, adequately integrating the information into model weights via fine-tuning remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce New News, a dataset composed of hypothetical yet plausible news spanning multiple domains (mathematics, coding, discoveries, leaderboards, events), accompanied by downstream evaluation questions whose correct answers critically depend on understanding and internalizing the news. First, we demonstrate a substantial gap between naive fine-tuning and in-context learning (FT-ICL gap) on our dataset. To address this gap, we explore a suite of self-play data generation protocols -- paraphrases, implications, and Self-QA -- designed to distill the knowledge processed by the model with context into the weights of the model, which we term System-2 Fine-tuning (Sys2-FT). We systematically evaluate ICL and Sys2-FT performance across data domains and model scales with the Qwen 2.5 family of models. Our results demonstrate that the Self-QA protocol of Sys2-FT significantly improves models' in-weight learning of the news while preserving general capabilities. Furthermore, we discover the contextual shadowing effect, where training with the news in context followed by its rephrases or QAs catastrophically degrades learning of the news. Finally, we show preliminary evidence of an emerging scaling law of Sys2-FT.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve high performance across many domains but can still face challenges in generalization when optimization is influenced by small or noisy gradient components. Sharpness-Aware Minimization improves generalization by perturbing parameters toward directions of high curvature, but it uses the entire gradient vector, which means that small or noisy components may affect the ascent step and cause the optimizer to miss optimal solutions. We propose Z-Score Filtered Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which applies Z-score based filtering to gradients in each layer. Instead of using all gradient components, a mask is constructed to retain only the top percentile with the largest absolute Z-scores. The percentile threshold $Q_p$ determines how many components are kept, so that the ascent step focuses on directions that stand out most compared to the average of the layer. This selective perturbation refines the search toward flatter minima while reducing the influence of less significant gradients. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with architectures including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that the proposed method consistently improves test accuracy compared to Sharpness-Aware Minimization and its variants.

Abstract: Reactive dance generation (RDG), the task of generating a dance conditioned on a lead dancer's motion, holds significant promise for enhancing human-robot interaction and immersive digital entertainment. Despite progress in duet synchronization and motion-music alignment, two key challenges remain: generating fine-grained spatial interactions and ensuring long-term temporal coherence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{ReactDance}, a diffusion framework that operates on a novel hierarchical latent space to address these spatiotemporal challenges in RDG. First, for high-fidelity spatial expression and fine-grained control, we propose Hierarchical Finite Scalar Quantization (\textbf{HFSQ}). This multi-scale motion representation effectively disentangles coarse body posture from subtle limb dynamics, enabling independent and detailed control over both aspects through a layered guidance mechanism. Second, to efficiently generate long sequences with high temporal coherence, we propose Blockwise Local Context (\textbf{BLC}), a non-autoregressive sampling strategy. Departing from slow, frame-by-frame generation, BLC partitions the sequence into blocks and synthesizes them in parallel via periodic causal masking and positional encodings. Coherence across these blocks is ensured by a dense sliding-window training approach that enriches the representation with local temporal context. Extensive experiments show that ReactDance substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in motion quality, long-term coherence, and sampling efficiency.

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to agent-based modeling (ABM) of social systems have traditionally emphasized rule-based behaviors, limiting their ability to capture nuanced dynamics by moving beyond predefined rules and leveraging contextual understanding from LMs of human social interaction. This paper presents SALM (Social Agent LM Framework), a novel approach for integrating language models (LMs) into social network simulation that achieves unprecedented temporal stability in multi-agent scenarios. Our primary contributions include: (1) a hierarchical prompting architecture enabling stable simulation beyond 4,000 timesteps while reducing token usage by 73%, (2) an attention-based memory system achieving 80% cache hit rates (95% CI [78%, 82%]) with sub-linear memory growth of 9.5%, and (3) formal bounds on personality stability. Through extensive validation against SNAP ego networks, we demonstrate the first LLM-based framework capable of modeling long-term social phenomena while maintaining empirically validated behavioral fidelity.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel infrastructure-aware benchmarking framework for quantifying the environmental footprint of LLM inference across 30 state-of-the-art models as deployed in commercial data centers. Our framework combines public API performance data with region-specific environmental multipliers and statistical inference of hardware configurations. We additionally utilize cross-efficiency Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank models by performance relative to environmental cost. Our results show that o3 and DeepSeek-R1 emerge as the most energy-intensive models, consuming over 33 Wh per long prompt, more than 70 times the consumption of GPT-4.1 nano, and that Claude-3.7 Sonnet ranks highest in eco-efficiency. While a single short GPT-4o query consumes 0.42 Wh, scaling this to 700 million queries/day results in substantial annual environmental impacts. These include electricity use comparable to 35,000 U.S. homes, freshwater evaporation matching the annual drinking needs of 1.2 million people, and carbon emissions requiring a Chicago-sized forest to offset. These findings illustrate a growing paradox: Although AI is becoming cheaper and faster, its global adoption drives disproportionate resource consumption. Our study provides a standardized, empirically grounded methodology for benchmarking the sustainability of LLM deployments, laying a foundation for future environmental accountability in AI development and sustainability standards.

<title>Fine-tuning Diffusion Policies with Backpropagation Through Diffusion Timesteps</title>

Abstract: Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.

<title>Learning When to Think: Shaping Adaptive Reasoning in R1-Style Models via Multi-Stage RL</title>

arXiv:2505.10832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) are proficient at generating explicit, step-by-step reasoning sequences before producing final answers. However, such detailed reasoning can introduce substantial computational overhead and latency, particularly for simple problems. To address this over-thinking problem, we explore how to equip LRMs with adaptive thinking capabilities: enabling them to dynamically decide whether or not to engage in explicit reasoning based on problem complexity. Building on R1-style distilled models, we observe that inserting a simple ellipsis ("...") into the prompt can stochastically trigger either a thinking or no-thinking mode, revealing a latent controllability in the reasoning behavior. Leveraging this property, we propose AutoThink, a multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) framework that progressively optimizes reasoning policies via stage-wise reward shaping. AutoThink learns to invoke explicit reasoning only when necessary, while defaulting to succinct responses for simpler tasks. Experiments on five mainstream mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoThink achieves favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to recent prompting and RL-based pruning methods. It can be seamlessly integrated into any R1-style model, including both distilled and further fine-tuned variants. Notably, AutoThink improves relative accuracy by 6.4 percent while reducing token usage by 52 percent on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, establishing a scalable and adaptive reasoning paradigm for LRMs. Project Page: https://github.com/ScienceOne-AI/AutoThink.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have substantially enhanced machine reasoning across diverse tasks. However, these models predominantly rely on pure text as the medium for both expressing and structuring reasoning, even when visual information is present. In this work, we argue that language may not always be the most natural or effective modality for reasoning, particularly in tasks involving spatial and geometrical information. Motivated by this, we propose a new paradigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual representations for these "vision-first" tasks, as a supplementary channel to language-based reasoning. In this paradigm, planning is executed via sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual domain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement Learning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models, leading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of representative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our visual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct reasoning in the text-only space. Our results establish Visual Planning as a viable and promising supplement to language-based reasoning, opening new avenues for tasks that benefit from intuitive, image-based inference.

<title>Continuous Optimization for Feature Selection with Permutation-Invariant Embedding and Policy-Guided Search</title>

Abstract: Feature selection removes redundant features to enhanc performance and computational efficiency in downstream tasks. Existing works often struggle to capture complex feature interactions and adapt to diverse scenarios. Recent advances in this domain have incorporated generative intelligence to address these drawbacks by uncovering intricate relationships between features. However, two key limitations remain: 1) embedding feature subsets in a continuous space is challenging due to permutation sensitivity, as changes in feature order can introduce biases and weaken the embedding learning process; 2) gradient-based search in the embedding space assumes convexity, which is rarely guaranteed, leading to reduced search effectiveness and suboptimal subsets. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework that can: 1) preserve feature subset knowledge in a continuous embedding space while ensuring permutation invariance; 2) effectively explore the embedding space without relying on strong convex assumptions. For the first objective, we develop an encoder-decoder paradigm to preserve feature selection knowledge into a continuous embedding space. This paradigm captures feature interactions through pairwise relationships within the subset, removing the influence of feature order on the embedding. Moreover, an inducing point mechanism is introduced to accelerate pairwise relationship computations. For the second objective, we employ a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) approach to guide the exploration of the embedding space. The RL agent effectively navigates the space by balancing multiple objectives. By prioritizing high-potential regions adaptively and eliminating the reliance on convexity assumptions, the RL agent effectively reduces the risk of converging to local optima. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, robustness and explicitness of our model.

<title>Fine-grained Contrastive Learning for ECG-Report Alignment with Waveform Enhancement</title>

arXiv:2505.11939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are essential for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. However, existing ECG-Report contrastive learning methods focus on whole-ECG and report alignment, missing the link between local ECG features and individual report tags. In this paper, we propose FG-CLEP (Fine-Grained Contrastive Language ECG Pre-training), which achieves fine-grained alignment between specific ECG segments and each tag in the report via tag-specific ECG representations. Furthermore, we found that nearly 55\% of ECG reports in the MIMIC-ECG training dataset lack detailed waveform features, which hinders fine-grained alignment. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine training process that leverages large language models (LLMs) to recover these missing waveform features and validate the LLM outputs using a coarse model. Additionally, fine-grained alignment at the tag level, rather than at the report level, exacerbates the false negative problem, as different reports may share common tags. To mitigate this, we introduce a semantic similarity matrix to guide the model in identifying and correcting false negatives. Experiments on six datasets demonstrate that FG-CLEP significantly improves fine-grained alignment, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot prediction and linear probing. Meanwhile, the fine-grained reports we generate also enhance the performance of other methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time alignment methods, such as Best-of-N sampling, offer a simple and effective way to steer language models (LMs) toward preferred behaviors using reward models (RM). However, these approaches can be computationally expensive, especially when applied uniformly across prompts without accounting for differences in alignment difficulty. In this work, we propose a prompt-adaptive strategy for Best-of-N alignment that allocates inference-time compute more efficiently. Motivated by latency concerns, we develop a two-stage algorithm: an initial exploratory phase estimates the reward distribution for each prompt using a small exploration budget, and a second stage adaptively allocates the remaining budget using these estimates. Our method is simple, practical, and compatible with any LM-RM combination. Empirical results on prompts from the AlpacaEval, HH-RLHF, and PKU-SafeRLHF datasets for 12 LM/RM pairs and 50 different batches of prompts show that our adaptive strategy outperforms the uniform allocation with the same inference budget. Moreover, we show that our adaptive strategy remains competitive against uniform allocations with 20 percent larger inference budgets and improves in performance as the batch size grows.

arXiv:2505.12053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern video generation frameworks based on Latent Diffusion Models suffer from inefficiencies in tokenization due to the Frame-Proportional Information Assumption. Existing tokenizers provide fixed temporal compression rates, causing the computational cost of the diffusion model to scale linearly with the frame rate. The paper proposes the Duration-Proportional Information Assumption: the upper bound on the information capacity of a video is proportional to the duration rather than the number of frames. Based on this insight, the paper introduces VFRTok, a Transformer-based video tokenizer, that enables variable frame rate encoding and decoding through asymmetric frame rate training between the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, the paper proposes Partial Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to decouple position and content modeling, which groups correlated patches into unified tokens. The Partial RoPE effectively improves content-awareness, enhancing the video generation capability. Benefiting from the compact and continuous spatio-temporal representation, VFRTok achieves competitive reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art generation fidelity while using only 1/8 tokens compared to existing tokenizers. The code and weights are released at: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/VFRTok.

arXiv:2505.12299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chain of Action-Planning Thoughts (CoaT) paradigm has been shown to improve the reasoning performance of VLM-based mobile agents in GUI tasks. However, the scarcity of diverse CoaT trajectories limits the expressiveness and generalization ability of such agents. While self-training is commonly employed to address data scarcity, existing approaches either overlook the correctness of intermediate reasoning steps or depend on expensive process-level annotations to construct process reward models (PRM). To address the above problems, we propose an Iterative Preference Learning (IPL) that constructs a CoaT-tree through interative sampling, scores leaf nodes using rule-based reward, and backpropagates feedback to derive Thinking-level Direct Preference Optimization (T-DPO) pairs. To prevent overfitting during warm-up supervised fine-tuning, we further introduce a three-stage instruction evolution, which leverages GPT-4o to generate diverse Q\&amp;A pairs based on real mobile UI screenshots, enhancing both generality and layout understanding. Experiments on three standard Mobile GUI-agent benchmarks demonstrate that our agent MobileIPL outperforms strong baselines, including continual pretraining models such as OS-ATLAS and UI-TARS. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across three standard Mobile GUI-Agents benchmarks and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain scenarios.

arXiv:2505.13257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A prominent issue in aligning language models (LMs) to personalized preferences is underspecification-- the lack of information from users about their preferences. A popular trend of injecting such specification is adding a prefix (e.g. prior relevant conversations) to the current user's conversation to steer preference distribution. Most methods passively model personal preferences with prior example preferences pairs. We ask whether models benefit from actively inferring preference descriptions, and address this question by creating a synthetic personalized alignment dataset based on famous people with known public preferences. We then test how effective finetuned 1-8B size models are at inferring and aligning to personal preferences. Results show that higher-quality active prefixes lead to better generalization, more contextually faithful models, and less systematic biases across different protected attributes. All our results suggest active alignment can lead to a more controllable and efficient path for personalized alignment.

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) utilizes structured demonstration-query inputs to induce few-shot learning on Language Models (LMs), which are not originally pre-trained on ICL-style data. To bridge the gap between ICL and pre-training, some approaches fine-tune LMs on large ICL-style datasets by an end-to-end paradigm with massive computational costs. To reduce such costs, in this paper, we propose Attention Behavior Fine-Tuning (ABFT), utilizing the previous findings on the inner mechanism of ICL, building training objectives on the attention scores instead of the final outputs, to force the attention scores to focus on the correct label tokens presented in the context and mitigate attention scores from the wrong label tokens. Our experiments on 9 modern LMs and 8 datasets empirically find that ABFT outperforms in performance, robustness, unbiasedness, and efficiency, with only around 0.01% data cost compared to the previous methods. Moreover, our subsequent analysis finds that the end-to-end training objective contains the ABFT objective, suggesting the implicit bias of ICL-style data to the emergence of induction heads. Our work demonstrates the possibility of controlling specific module sequences within LMs to improve their behavior, opening up the future application of mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: Despite considerable progress in the development of machine-text detectors, it has been suggested that the problem is inherently hard, and therefore, that stakeholders should proceed under the assumption that machine-generated text cannot be reliably detected as such. We examine a recent such claim by Nicks et al. (2024) regarding the ease with which language models can be optimized to degrade the performance of machine-text detectors, including detectors not specifically optimized against. We identify a feature space -- the stylistic feature space -- that is robust to such optimization, and show that it may be used to reliably detect samples from language models optimized to prevent detection. Furthermore, we show that even when models are explicitly optimized against stylistic detectors, detection performance remains surprisingly unaffected. We then seek to understand if stylistic detectors are inherently more robust. To study this question, we explore a new paraphrasing approach that simultaneously aims to close the gap between human writing and machine writing in stylistic feature space while avoiding detection using traditional features. We show that when only a single sample is available for detection, this attack is universally effective across all detectors considered, including those that use writing style. However, as the number of samples available for detection grows, the human and machine distributions become distinguishable. Overall, our findings underscore previous recommendations to avoid reliance on machine-text detection.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific discovery. Existing approaches, however, often automate scientific discovery using predefined workflows that lack rationality constraints. This often leads to aimless hypothesizing and a failure to consistently link hypotheses with evidence, thereby hindering the systematic reduction of uncertainty. Overcoming these limitations fundamentally requires a principled approach to exploration. We introduce PiFlow, an information-theoretical framework, treating automated scientific discovery as a structured uncertainty reduction problem guided by principles (e.g., scientific laws). In evaluations across three distinct scientific domains -- discovering nanomaterial structures, bio-molecules, and superconductor candidates with targeted properties -- our method significantly improves discovery efficiency, reflected by a 73.55\% increase in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of property values versus exploration steps, and enhances solution quality by 94.06\% compared to a vanilla agent system. Overall, PiFlow serves as a Plug-and-Play method, establishing a novel paradigm shift in highly efficient automated scientific discovery, paving the way for more robust and accelerated AI-driven research. Code is publicly available at our \href{https://github.com/amair-lab/PiFlow}{GitHub}.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM agents have largely built on reasoning backbones like ReAct, which interleave thought and action in complex environments. However, ReAct often produces ungrounded or incoherent reasoning steps, leading to misalignment between the agent's actual state and goal. Our analysis finds that this stems from ReAct's inability to maintain consistent internal beliefs and goal alignment, causing compounding errors and hallucinations. To address this, we introduce ReflAct, a novel backbone that shifts reasoning from merely planning next actions to continuously reflecting on the agent's state relative to its goal. By explicitly grounding decisions in states and enforcing ongoing goal alignment, ReflAct dramatically improves strategic reliability. This design delivers substantial empirical gains: ReflAct surpasses ReAct by 27.7% on average, achieving a 93.3% success rate in ALFWorld. Notably, ReflAct even outperforms ReAct with added enhancement modules (e.g., Reflexion, WKM), showing that strengthening the core reasoning backbone is key to reliable agent performance.

<title>Scaling Diffusion Transformers Efficiently via $\mu$P</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the foundation for vision generative models, but their scalability is limited by the high cost of hyperparameter (HP) tuning at large scales. Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However, it remains unclear whether $\mu$P of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we generalize standard $\mu$P to diffusion Transformers and validate its effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that $\mu$P of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including DiT, U-ViT, PixArt-$\alpha$, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer, enabling the direct application of existing $\mu$P methodologies. Leveraging this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-$\mu$P enjoys robust HP transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-$\mu$P with transferred learning rate achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of $\mu$P on text-to-image generation by scaling PixArt-$\alpha$ from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases, models under $\mu$P outperform their respective baselines while requiring small tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-$\alpha$ and 3% of consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish $\mu$P as a principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers.

<title>Better Safe Than Sorry? Overreaction Problem of Vision Language Models in Visual Emergency Recognition</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown capabilities in interpreting visual content, but their reliability in safety-critical scenarios remains insufficiently explored. We introduce VERI, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 200 synthetic images (100 contrastive pairs) and an additional 50 real-world images (25 pairs) for validation. Each emergency scene is paired with a visually similar but safe counterpart through human verification. Using a two-stage evaluation protocol (risk identification and emergency response), we assess 17 VLMs across medical emergencies, accidents, and natural disasters. Our analysis reveals an "overreaction problem": models achieve high recall (70-100%) but suffer from low precision, misclassifying 31-96% of safe situations as dangerous. Seven safe scenarios were universally misclassified by all models. This "better-safe-than-sorry" bias stems from contextual overinterpretation (88-98% of errors). Both synthetic and real-world datasets confirm these systematic patterns, challenging VLM reliability in safety-critical applications. Addressing this requires enhanced contextual reasoning in ambiguous visual situations.

Abstract: With recent breakthroughs in large-scale modeling, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in a variety of visual applications. However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts, thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets. Datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/LiamLian0727/UIIS10K.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of language models has demonstrated the potential of artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry. However, small language models struggle with specialized domains in low-resource languages like Persian. While numerous medical-domain websites exist in Persian, no curated dataset or corpus has been available making ours the first of its kind. This study explores the enhancement of medical knowledge in a small language model by leveraging accessible online data, including a crawled corpus from medical magazines and a dataset of real doctor-patient Q&amp;A pairs.
  We fine-tuned a baseline model using our curated data to improve its medical knowledge. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves improved accuracy in medical question answering and provides better responses compared to its baseline. Notably, the trained model successfully passed the Iranian Basic Medical Science Entrance Exam, taken in September 2023, and improved Persian-translated MMLU accuracy by an average of 2.67%. This work highlights the potential of leveraging open-access online data to enrich small language models in medical fields, providing a novel solution for Persian medical AI applications suitable for resource-constrained environments.

<title>Not All Models Suit Expert Offloading: On Local Routing Consistency of Mixture-of-Expert Models</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enables efficient scaling of large language models (LLMs) with sparsely activated experts during inference. To effectively deploy large MoE models on memory-constrained devices, many systems introduce *expert offloading* that caches a subset of experts in fast memory, leaving others on slow memory to run on CPU or load on demand. While some research has exploited the locality of expert activations, where consecutive tokens activate similar experts, the degree of this **local routing consistency** varies across models and remains understudied. In this paper, we propose two metrics to measure local routing consistency of MoE models: (1) **Segment Routing Best Performance (SRP)**, which evaluates how well a fixed group of experts can cover the needs of a segment of tokens, and (2) **Segment Cache Best Hit Rate (SCH)**, which measures the optimal segment-level cache hit rate under a given cache size limit. We analyzed 20 MoE LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures and found that models that apply MoE on every layer and do not use shared experts exhibit the highest local routing consistency. We further showed that domain-specialized experts contribute more to routing consistency than vocabulary-specialized ones, and that most models can balance between cache effectiveness and efficiency with cache sizes approximately 2x the active experts. These findings pave the way for memory-efficient MoE design and deployment without compromising inference speed. We publish the code for replicating experiments at https://github.com/ljcleo/moe-lrc .

<title>Scalable Graph Generative Modeling via Substructure Sequences</title>

arXiv:2505.16130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been predominantly driven by message-passing, where node representations are iteratively updated via local neighborhood aggregation. Despite their success, message-passing suffers from fundamental limitations -- including constrained expressiveness, over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited capacity to model long-range dependencies. These issues hinder scalability: increasing data size or model size often fails to yield improved performance. To this end, we explore pathways beyond message-passing and introduce Generative Graph Pattern Machine (G$^2$PM), a generative Transformer pre-training framework for graphs. G$^2$PM represents graph instances (nodes, edges, or entire graphs) as sequences of substructures, and employs generative pre-training over the sequences to learn generalizable and transferable representations. Empirically, G$^2$PM demonstrates strong scalability: on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark, it continues to improve with model sizes up to 60M parameters, outperforming prior generative approaches that plateau at significantly smaller scales (e.g., 3M). In addition, we systematically analyze the model design space, highlighting key architectural choices that contribute to its scalability and generalization. Across diverse tasks -- including node/link/graph classification, transfer learning, and cross-graph pretraining -- G$^2$PM consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing a compelling foundation for scalable graph learning. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/G2PM.

arXiv:2505.16322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-Taught Reasoners (STaR), synonymously known as Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT), is an integral part of the training pipeline of self-improving reasoning Language Models (LMs). The self-improving mechanism often employs random observation (data) sampling. However, this results in trained observation imbalance; inefficiently over-training on solved examples while under-training on challenging ones. In response, we introduce Adaptive STaR (AdaSTaR), a novel algorithm that rectifies this by integrating two adaptive sampling principles: (1) Adaptive Sampling for Diversity: promoting balanced training across observations, and (2) Adaptive Sampling for Curriculum: dynamically adjusting data difficulty to match the model's evolving strength. Across six benchmarks, AdaSTaR achieves best test accuracy in all instances (6/6) and reduces training FLOPs by an average of 58.6% against an extensive list of baselines. These improvements in performance and efficiency generalize to different pre-trained LMs and larger models, paving the way for more efficient and effective self-improving LMs.

<title>BitHydra: Towards Bit-flip Inference Cost Attack against Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed, but their growing compute demands expose them to inference cost attacks that maximize output length. We reveal that prior attacks are fundamentally self-targeting because they rely on crafted inputs, so the added cost accrues to the attacker's own queries and scales poorly in practice. In this work, we introduce the first bit-flip inference cost attack that directly modifies model weights to induce persistent overhead for all users of a compromised LLM. Such attacks are stealthy yet realistic in practice: for instance, in shared MLaaS environments, co-located tenants can exploit hardware-level faults (e.g., Rowhammer) to flip memory bits storing model parameters. We instantiate this attack paradigm with BitHydra, which (1) minimizes a loss that suppresses the end-of-sequence token (i.e., EOS) and (2) employs an efficient yet effective critical-bit search focused on the EOS embedding vector, sharply reducing the search space while preserving benign-looking outputs. We evaluate across 11 LLMs (1.5B-14B) under int8 and float16, demonstrating that our method efficiently achieves scalable cost inflation with only a few bit flips, while remaining effective even against potential defenses.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding and generation, but their enormous computational and memory requirements hinder deployment. Compression offers a potential solution to mitigate these constraints. However, most existing methods rely on fixed heuristics and thus fail to adapt to runtime memory variations or heterogeneous KV-cache demands arising from diverse user requests. To address these limitations, we propose RAP, an elastic pruning framework driven by reinforcement learning (RL) that dynamically adjusts compression strategies in a runtime-aware manner. Specifically, RAP dynamically tracks the evolving ratio between model parameters and KV-cache across practical execution. Recognizing that FFNs house most parameters, whereas parameter -light attention layers dominate KV-cache formation, the RL agent retains only those components that maximize utility within the current memory budget, conditioned on instantaneous workload and device state. Extensive experiments results demonstrate that RAP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, marking the first time to jointly consider model weights and KV-cache on the fly.

Abstract: Given the central role of charts in scientific, business, and communication contexts, enhancing the chart understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) has become increasingly critical. A key limitation of existing VLMs lies in their inaccurate visual grounding of infographic elements, including charts and human-recognizable objects (HROs) such as icons and images. However, chart understanding often requires identifying relevant elements and reasoning over them. To address this limitation, we introduce InfoDet, a dataset designed to support the development of accurate object detection models for charts and HROs in infographics. It contains 11,264 real and 90,000 synthetic infographics, with over 14 million bounding box annotations. These annotations are created by combining the model-in-the-loop and programmatic methods. We demonstrate the usefulness of InfoDet through three applications: 1) constructing a Thinking-with-Boxes scheme to boost the chart understanding performance of VLMs, 2) comparing existing object detection models, and 3) applying the developed detection model to document layout and UI element detection.

<title>On the Design of KL-Regularized Policy Gradient Algorithms for LLM Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2505.17508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy gradient algorithms have been successfully applied to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). KL regularization is ubiquitous, yet the design surface, choice of KL direction (forward vs. reverse), normalization (normalized vs. unnormalized), and estimator ($k_1/k_2/k_3$), is scattered across the literature and often intertwined with off-policy estimation. We ask a focused question: under the off-policy setting, what weighting is required for each KL variant so that the surrogate we optimize yields the exact gradient of the intended KL-regularized objective?
  We answer this with a compact, unified derivation we call the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) view. RPG (i) unifies normalized and unnormalized KL variants and shows that the widely-used $k_3$ penalty is exactly the unnormalized KL; (ii) specifies conditions under which REINFORCE-style losses with stop-gradient are gradient-equivalent to fully differentiable surrogates; (iii) identifies and corrects an off-policy importance-weighting mismatch in GRPO's KL term; and (iv) introduces RPG-Style Clip, a truncated-importance-sampling step within RPG-REINFORCE that enables stable, off-policy policy-gradient training at scale.
  On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25), RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip improves accuracy by up to $+6$ absolute percentage points over DAPO. Notably, RPG is a stable and scalable RL algorithm for LLM reasoning, realized via (a) a KL-correct objective, (b) truncated importance sampling, and (c) an iterative reference-policy update scheme.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a widely used method for aligning large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often suffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the reward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the idiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is iterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated human feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption, the dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in iterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model training data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used for optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled AlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over successive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth preferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while reinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation flexibility. Other initialisation strategies often fail to recover from early overoptimisation. These findings offer actionable insights for building more stable and generalisable RLHF pipelines.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models, essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial structures, they remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint. In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume access to an empirical risk minimizer. In this work, we present a principled theoretical framework analyzing diffusion models, providing a state-of-the-art sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$. Our structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical and optimization components offers critical insights into how diffusion models can be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance of diffusion models.

<title>ThanoRA: Task Heterogeneity-Aware Multi-Task Low-Rank Adaptation</title>

arXiv:2505.18640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely adopted for downstream fine-tuning of foundation models due to its efficiency and zero additional inference cost. Many real-world applications require foundation models to specialize in several specific tasks simultaneously, motivating the need for efficient multi-task downstream adaptation. To address this need, existing studies have primarily explored two directions: Model Merging with LoRA, which shows advantages in training-free scenarios but still lags behind multi-task training in overall performance; and MoE-based LoRA approaches, which improve multi-task learning performance but introduce routers that hinder the mergeability of LoRA parameters and incur considerable inference overhead, thereby limiting real-world deployment practicality. To this end, we propose ThanoRA, a Task Heterogeneity-Aware Multi-Task Low-Rank Adaptation framework that enables effective, efficient and unified multi-task downstream adaptation without introducing additional structure. ThanoRA performs multi-task learning by tailoring subspace allocation at initialization and enforcing diversity preservation throughout training: it allocates varying dimensions to construct task-specific low-rank subspaces driven by inter-task heterogeneity, enabling fine-grained knowledge injection, while diversity-preserving regularization mitigates task interference and subspace collapse, thereby fully exploiting the low-rank capacity. Extensive experiments across multimodal and text-only benchmarks under varying multi-task mixtures demonstrate that ThanoRA consistently outperforms strong baselines, surpassing even separate task-specific fine-tuning, while introducing no additional structures or inference overhead. Our code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/LiangJian24/ThanoRA.

Abstract: Quantization and fine-tuning are crucial for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices. However, fine-tuning quantized models presents significant challenges, primarily stemming from: First, the mismatch in data types between the low-precision quantized weights (e.g., 4-bit) and the high-precision adaptation weights (e.g., 16-bit). This mismatch limits the computational efficiency advantage offered by quantized weights during inference. Second, potential accuracy degradation when merging these high-precision adaptation weights into the low-precision quantized weights, as the adaptation weights often necessitate approximation or truncation. Third, as far as we know, no existing methods support the lossless merging of adaptation while adjusting all quantized weights. To address these challenges, we introduce lossless ternary adaptation for quantization-aware fine-tuning (LoTA-QAF). This is a novel fine-tuning method specifically designed for quantized LLMs, enabling the lossless merging of ternary adaptation weights into quantized weights and the adjustment of all quantized weights. LoTA-QAF operates through a combination of: i) A custom-designed ternary adaptation (TA) that aligns ternary weights with the quantization grid and uses these ternary weights to adjust quantized weights. ii) A TA-based mechanism that enables the lossless merging of adaptation weights. iii) Ternary signed gradient descent (t-SignSGD) for updating the TA weights. We apply LoTA-QAF to Llama-3.1/3.3 and Qwen-2.5 model families and validate its effectiveness on several downstream tasks. On the MMLU benchmark, our method effectively recovers performance for quantized models, surpassing 16-bit LoRA by up to 5.14\%. For task-specific fine-tuning, 16-bit LoRA achieves superior results, but LoTA-QAF still outperforms other methods. Code: github.com/KingdalfGoodman/LoTA-QAF.

Abstract: Audio generation systems now create very realistic soundscapes that can enhance media production, but also pose potential risks. Several studies have examined deepfakes in speech or singing voice. However, environmental sounds have different characteristics, which may make methods for detecting speech and singing deepfakes less effective for real-world sounds. In addition, existing datasets for environmental sound deepfake detection are limited in scale and audio types. To address this gap, we introduce EnvSDD, the first large-scale curated dataset designed for this task, consisting of 45.25 hours of real and 316.74 hours of fake audio. The test set includes diverse conditions to evaluate the generalizability, such as unseen generation models and unseen datasets. We also propose an audio deepfake detection system, based on a pre-trained audio foundation model. Results on EnvSDD show that our proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art systems from speech and singing domains.

Abstract: Faithful free-text explanations are important to ensure transparency in high-stakes AI decision-making contexts, but they are challenging to generate by language models and assess by humans. In this paper, we present a measure for Prediction-EXplanation (PEX) consistency, by extending the concept of weight of evidence. This measure quantifies how much a free-text explanation supports or opposes a prediction, serving as an important aspect of explanation faithfulness. Our analysis reveals that more than 62% explanations generated by large language models lack this consistency. We show that applying direct preference optimization improves the consistency of generated explanations across three model families, with improvement ranging from 43.1% to 292.3%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizing this consistency measure can improve explanation faithfulness by up to 9.7%.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks, yet they often exhibit difficulty in distinguishing task-relevant from irrelevant signals -- particularly in tasks like Visual Question Answering -- which can lead to susceptibility to misleading or spurious inputs. We refer to this broader limitation as the Cross-Modality Competency Problem -- the model's inability to fairly evaluate all modalities. This vulnerability becomes more evident in modality-specific tasks -- such as image classification or pure text question answering -- where models are expected to rely solely on one modality. In such tasks, spurious information from irrelevant modalities often leads to significant performance degradation. We refer to this failure as Modality Interference, which serves as a concrete and measurable instance of the cross-modality competency problem, and we further design a perturbation-based causal diagnostic experiment to verify and quantify this problem. To mitigate modality interference, we propose a novel framework to finetune MLLMs, including perturbation-based data augmentations with both heuristic perturbations and adversarial perturbations, and a consistency regularization strategy applying on model outputs with original and perturbed inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets (image-heavy, text-heavy and multimodal tasks) and multiple model families with different scales demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and cross-modality competency, indicating our method's effectiveness in boosting unimodal reasoning ability while enhancing performance on multimodal tasks.

<title>ePC: Overcoming Exponential Signal Decay in Deep Predictive Coding Networks</title>

Abstract: Predictive Coding (PC) offers a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation for neural network training, yet struggles with deeper architectures. This paper identifies the root cause and provides a principled solution. We uncover that the canonical state-based formulation of PC (sPC) is, by design, deeply inefficient on digital hardware, due to an inherent signal decay problem that scales exponentially with depth. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel reparameterization of PC, named error-based PC (ePC), which does not suffer from signal decay. By optimizing over prediction errors rather than states, ePC enables signals to reach all layers simultaneously and unattenuated, converging orders of magnitude faster than sPC. Experiments across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate that ePC matches backpropagation's performance even for deeper models where sPC struggles. Besides practical improvements, our work provides theoretical insight into PC dynamics and establishes a foundation for scaling bio-inspired learning to deeper architectures on digital hardware and beyond.

<title>Variational Deep Learning via Implicit Regularization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20235</link>

arXiv:2505.20235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern deep learning models generalize remarkably well in-distribution, despite being overparametrized and trained with little to no explicit regularization. Instead, current theory credits implicit regularization imposed by the choice of architecture, hyperparameters and optimization procedure. However, deep neural networks can be surprisingly non-robust, resulting in overconfident predictions and poor out-of-distribution generalization. Bayesian deep learning addresses this via model averaging, but typically requires significant computational resources as well as carefully elicited priors to avoid overriding the benefits of implicit regularization. Instead, in this work, we propose to regularize variational neural networks solely by relying on the implicit bias of (stochastic) gradient descent. We theoretically characterize this inductive bias in overparametrized linear models as generalized variational inference and demonstrate the importance of the choice of parametrization. Empirically, our approach demonstrates strong in- and out-of-distribution performance without additional hyperparameter tuning and with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Generalizable active mapping in complex unknown environments remains a critical challenge for mobile robots. Existing methods, constrained by insufficient training data and conservative exploration strategies, exhibit limited generalizability across scenes with diverse layouts and complex connectivity. To enable scalable training and reliable evaluation, we introduce GLEAM-Bench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for generalizable active mapping with 1,152 diverse 3D scenes from synthetic and real-scan datasets. Building upon this foundation, we propose GLEAM, a unified generalizable exploration policy for active mapping. Its superior generalizability comes mainly from our semantic representations, long-term navigable goals, and randomized strategies. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 66.50% coverage (+9.49%) with efficient trajectories and improved mapping accuracy on 128 unseen complex scenes.

arXiv:2505.20346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Function-guided protein design is a crucial task with significant applications in drug discovery and enzyme engineering. However, the field lacks a unified and comprehensive evaluation framework. Current models are assessed using inconsistent and limited subsets of metrics, which prevents fair comparison and a clear understanding of the relationships between different evaluation criteria. To address this gap, we introduce PDFBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for function-guided denovo protein design. Our benchmark systematically evaluates eight state-of-the-art models on 16 metrics across two key settings: description-guided design, for which we repurpose the Mol-Instructions dataset, originally lacking quantitative benchmarking, and keyword-guided design, for which we introduce a new test set, SwissTest, created with a strict datetime cutoff to ensure data integrity. By benchmarking across a wide array of metrics and analyzing their correlations, PDFBench enables more reliable model comparisons and provides key insights to guide future research.

<title>SpecExtend: A Drop-in Enhancement for Speculative Decoding of Long Sequences</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20776</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.20776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely used technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), but its performance degrades as input length grows, with significant drops even at moderate lengths. Yet, this early degradation has remained largely underexplored. We introduce SpecExtend, a drop-in enhancement that improves speculative decoding on long sequences without additional training. SpecExtend integrates efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Hybrid Tree Attention to accelerate prefill and verification steps. To improve both draft accuracy and speed on long inputs without retraining, we propose Cross-model Retrieval, a novel KV cache eviction strategy that leverages the target model's attention scores to dynamically select relevant context for the smaller draft model. Extensive evaluations show that SpecExtend accelerates speculative decoding by up to 2.84x on 16K-token long summarization and up to 3.86x on long reasoning, while preserving the short-input performance of state-of-the-art frameworks. Our code is available at https://github.com/jycha98/SpecExtend .

<title>Any-to-Bokeh: Arbitrary-Subject Video Refocusing with Video Diffusion Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21593</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for camera simulation, enabling both geometric transformations and realistic optical effects. Among these, image-based bokeh rendering has shown promising results, but diffusion for video bokeh remains unexplored. Existing image-based methods are plagued by temporal flickering and inconsistent blur transitions, while current video editing methods lack explicit control over the focus plane and bokeh intensity. These issues limit their applicability for controllable video bokeh. In this work, we propose a one-step diffusion framework for generating temporally coherent, depth-aware video bokeh rendering. The framework employs a multi-plane image (MPI) representation adapted to the focal plane to condition the video diffusion model, thereby enabling it to exploit strong 3D priors from pretrained backbones. To further enhance temporal stability, depth robustness, and detail preservation, we introduce a progressive training strategy. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate superior temporal coherence, spatial accuracy, and controllability, outperforming prior baselines. This work represents the first dedicated diffusion framework for video bokeh generation, establishing a new baseline for temporally coherent and controllable depth-of-field effects. Code will be made publicly available.

<title>Cross-modal RAG: Sub-dimensional Text-to-Image Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21956</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image generation increasingly demands access to domain-specific, fine-grained, and rapidly evolving knowledge that pretrained models cannot fully capture, necessitating the integration of retrieval methods. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods attempt to address this by retrieving globally relevant images, but they fail when no single image contains all desired elements from a complex user query. We propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in the retrieval and further contributes to generation quality, while maintaining high efficiency.

<title>Communication-Efficient Desire Alignment for Embodied Agent-Human Adaptation</title>

arXiv:2505.22503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While embodied agents have made significant progress in performing complex physical tasks, real-world applications demand more than pure task execution. The agents must collaborate with unfamiliar agents and human users, whose goals are often vague and implicit. In such settings, interpreting ambiguous instructions and uncovering underlying desires is essential for effective assistance. Therefore, fast and accurate desire alignment becomes a critical capability for embodied agents. In this work, we first develop a home assistance simulation environment HA-Desire that integrates an LLM-driven proxy human user exhibiting realistic value-driven goal selection and communication. The ego agent must interact with this proxy user to infer and adapt to the user's latent desires. To achieve this, we present a novel framework FAMER for fast desire alignment, which introduces a desire-based mental reasoning mechanism to identify user intent and filter desire-irrelevant actions. We further design a reflection-based communication module that reduces redundant inquiries, and incorporate goal-relevant information extraction with memory persistence to improve information reuse and reduce unnecessary exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances both task execution and communication efficiency, enabling embodied agents to quickly adapt to user-specific desires in complex embodied environments.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced the modeling of 3D molecular structure by leveraging group representations. However, their message passing, heavily relying on Clebsch-Gordan tensor product convolutions, suffers from restricted expressiveness due to the limited non-linearity and low degree of group representations. To overcome this, we introduce the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel plug-and-play framework that applies a Transformer-like architecture to the Fourier spatial domain of group representations. EST achieves higher expressiveness than conventional models while preserving the crucial equivariant inductive bias through a uniform sampling strategy of spherical Fourier transforms. As demonstrated by our experiments on challenging benchmarks like OC20 and QM9, EST-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance. For the complex molecular systems within OC20, small models empowered by EST can outperform some larger models and those using additional data. In addition to demonstrating such strong expressiveness,we provide both theoretical and experimental validation of EST's equivariance as well, paving the way for new research in this area.

Abstract: Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a cornerstone of structural biology, enabling near-atomic resolution analysis of macromolecules through advanced computational methods. However, the development of cryo-EM processing tools is constrained by the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets. Synthetic data generation offers a promising alternative, but existing approaches lack thorough biophysical modeling of heterogeneity and fail to reproduce the complex noise observed in real imaging. To address these limitations, we present CryoCCD, a synthesis framework that unifies versatile biophysical modeling with the first conditional cycle-consistent diffusion model tailored for cryo-EM. The biophysical engine provides multi-functional generation capabilities to capture authentic biological organization, and the diffusion model is enhanced with cycle consistency and mask-guided contrastive learning to ensure realistic noise while preserving structural fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CryoCCD generates structurally faithful micrographs, enhances particle picking and pose estimation, as well as achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, while also generalizing effectively to held-out protein families.

<title>ReCalKV: Low-Rank KV Cache Compression via Head Reordering and Offline Calibration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, but their long-context reasoning remains constrained by the excessive memory required for the Key-Value (KV) cache. This makes KV cache compression a critical step toward efficient long-context inference. Recent methods have explored low-rank techniques to reduce the hidden size of the KV cache. However, they neglect the distinct roles and varying importance of Keys and Values, leading to significant performance drops under high compression. To address this, we propose ReCalKV, a post-training low-rank KV cache compression approach with tailored strategies for Keys and Values. For Keys, we propose Head-wise Similarity aware Reordering (HSR), which clusters structurally similar heads into groups, enabling more accurate low-rank approximation via grouped SVD. For Values, we propose Offline Value Calibration (OVC), which efficiently calibrates the value projection matrix using calibration data without training, ensuring an accurate representation of contextual information. Extensive experiments show that ReCalKV consistently outperforms existing low-rank compression methods, achieving high compression ratios with minimal performance loss. The code and models will be available at:https://github.com/XIANGLONGYAN/ReCalKV.

<title>Improving Reliability and Explainability of Medical Question Answering through Atomic Fact Checking in Retrieval-Augmented LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit extensive medical knowledge but are prone to hallucinations and inaccurate citations, which pose a challenge to their clinical adoption and regulatory compliance. Current methods, such as Retrieval Augmented Generation, partially address these issues by grounding answers in source documents, but hallucinations and low fact-level explainability persist. In this work, we introduce a novel atomic fact-checking framework designed to enhance the reliability and explainability of LLMs used in medical long-form question answering. This method decomposes LLM-generated responses into discrete, verifiable units called atomic facts, each of which is independently verified against an authoritative knowledge base of medical guidelines. This approach enables targeted correction of errors and direct tracing to source literature, thereby improving the factual accuracy and explainability of medical Q&amp;A. Extensive evaluation using multi-reader assessments by medical experts and an automated open Q&amp;A benchmark demonstrated significant improvements in factual accuracy and explainability. Our framework achieved up to a 40% overall answer improvement and a 50% hallucination detection rate. The ability to trace each atomic fact back to the most relevant chunks from the database provides a granular, transparent explanation of the generated responses, addressing a major gap in current medical AI applications. This work represents a crucial step towards more trustworthy and reliable clinical applications of LLMs, addressing key prerequisites for clinical application and fostering greater confidence in AI-assisted healthcare.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have pushed the boundaries of the visual reasoning capabilities in large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, training LVLMs with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is computationally expensive, posing a significant challenge to scaling model size. In this work, we propose ProxyThinker, an inference-time technique that enables large models to inherit the visual reasoning capabilities from small, slow-thinking visual reasoners without any training. By subtracting the output distributions of base models from those of RFT reasoners, ProxyThinker modifies the decoding dynamics and successfully elicits the slow-thinking reasoning demonstrated by the emerged sophisticated behaviors such as self-verification and self-correction. ProxyThinker consistently boosts performance on challenging visual benchmarks on spatial, mathematical, and multi-disciplinary reasoning, enabling untuned base models to compete with the performance of their full-scale RFT counterparts. Furthermore, our implementation efficiently coordinates multiple language models with parallelism techniques and achieves up to 38 $\times$ faster inference compared to previous decoding-time methods, paving the way for the practical deployment of ProxyThinker. Code is available at https://github.com/MrZilinXiao/ProxyThinker.

Abstract: The reasoning, writing, text-editing, and retrieval capabilities of proprietary large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly, providing users with an ever-expanding set of functionalities. However, this growing utility has also led to a serious societal concern: the over-reliance on LLMs. In particular, users increasingly delegate tasks such as homework, assignments, or the processing of sensitive documents to LLMs without meaningful engagement. This form of over-reliance and misuse is emerging as a significant social issue. In order to mitigate these issues, we propose a method injecting imperceptible phantom tokens into documents, which causes LLMs to generate outputs that appear plausible to users but are in fact incorrect. Based on this technique, we introduce TRAPDOC, a framework designed to deceive over-reliant LLM users. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on proprietary LLMs, comparing its impact against several baselines. TRAPDOC serves as a strong foundation for promoting more responsible and thoughtful engagement with language models. Our code is available at https://github.com/jindong22/TrapDoc.

arXiv:2506.00613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating robot control policies is difficult: real-world testing is costly, and handcrafted simulators require manual effort to improve in realism and generality. We propose a world-model-based policy evaluation environment (WorldGym), an autoregressive, action-conditioned video generation model which serves as a proxy to real world environments. Policies are evaluated via Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model, with a vision-language model providing rewards. We evaluate a set of VLA-based real-robot policies in the world model using only initial frames from real robots, and show that policy success rates within the world model highly correlate with real-world success rates. Moreoever, we show that WorldGym is able to preserve relative policy rankings across different policy versions, sizes, and training checkpoints. Due to requiring only a single start frame as input, the world model further enables efficient evaluation of robot policies' generalization ability on novel tasks and environments. We find that modern VLA-based robot policies still struggle to distinguish object shapes and can become distracted by adversarial facades of objects. While generating highly realistic object interaction remains challenging, WorldGym faithfully emulates robot motions and offers a practical starting point for safe and reproducible policy evaluation before deployment.

Abstract: Although audio foundations models have seen great progress on a wide variety of tasks, their application in real-world acoustic environments with reverberation and noise has been less successful. Moreover, as audio foundation models are typically trained on dry, single-channel audio clips, the inherent spatial nature of real-world sound scenes is overlooked and tasks involving sound localization ruled out. To address these limitations, we propose GRAM: a General-purpose Real-world Audio Model utilizing a multi-channel masked auto-encoder approach to efficiently learn spatial audio representations from high-quality simulated real-world scenes. To evaluate the performance of GRAM and other audio foundation models in real-world sound scenes, we release Nat-HEAR: A naturalistic version of the HEAR benchmark suite comprising a simulated real-world version, as well as two new sound localization tasks. We show that the performance of GRAM surpasses all state-of-the-art self-supervised audio foundation models and speech models on both HEAR and Nat-HEAR, while using only a fraction of the training data. GRAM also showcases state-of-the-art localization performance, surpassing even supervised sound localization approaches, and can be flexibly applied either to a two-channel, binaural sound format or a four-channel, Ambisonics format. Validating GRAM's performance on real-world sound recordings demonstrates robust transfer to real-world scenes. Taken together, GRAM presents a significant advancement towards robust, spatial audio foundation models for real-world applications.

Abstract: Current Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT) paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from sample inefficiency due to the redundant exposure of identical queries under uniform data sampling. While previous work has explored curriculum learning via heuristic difficulty metrics, these strategies exhibit limitations by neglecting the intrinsic learning signals generated by the model itself, thus leading to suboptimal training regimes. In this paper, we identify a model-inherent signal termed angle concentration that effectively reflects an LLM's capacity to learn from specific data. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate a correlation between the angular distribution of token hidden state vectors and the resulting gradient, revealing a learning preference for data exhibiting higher angle concentration. Inspired by this finding, we propose GAIN-RL, a Gradient-driven Angle-Informed Navigated RL framework. By leveraging the model's intrinsic angle concentration signal, GAIN-RL dynamically selects training data in each epoch, ensuring consistently impactful gradient updates and thus significantly enhancing overall training efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that GAIN-RL (GRPO) achieves over a 2.5x acceleration in training efficiency across diverse mathematical and coding tasks and varying model scales. Furthermore, GAIN-RL (GRPO)'s efficient sampling yields data-efficient training, achieving better performance with half the original data compared to vanilla GRPO with full training data.

Abstract: Electrostatic field matching (EFM) has recently appeared as a novel physics-inspired paradigm for data generation and transfer using the idea of an electric capacitor. However, it requires modeling electrostatic fields using neural networks, which is non-trivial because of the necessity to take into account the complex field outside the capacitor plates. In this paper, we propose Interaction Field Matching (IFM), a generalization of EFM which allows using general interaction fields beyond the electrostatic one. Furthermore, inspired by strong interactions between quarks and antiquarks in physics, we design a particular interaction field realization which solves the problems which arise when modeling electrostatic fields in EFM. We show the performance on a series of toy and image data transfer problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.

Abstract: The use of target networks in deep reinforcement learning is a widely popular solution to mitigate the brittleness of semi-gradient approaches and stabilize learning. However, target networks notoriously require additional memory and delay the propagation of Bellman updates compared to an ideal target-free approach. In this work, we step out of the binary choice between target-free and target-based algorithms. We introduce a new method that uses a copy of the last linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network. This simple modification enables us to keep the target-free's low-memory footprint while leveraging the target-based literature. We find that combining our approach with the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning consecutive Bellman updates in parallel, helps improve the sample-efficiency of target-free approaches. Our proposed method, iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), bridges the performance gap between target-free and target-based approaches across various problems, while using a single Q-network, thus being a step forward towards resource-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this, we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance. Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

<title>Reshaping Reasoning in LLMs: A Theoretical Analysis of RL Training Dynamics through Pattern Selection</title>

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models, the training dynamics of RL in LLMs remain unclear. In this work, we provide an explanation of the RL training process through empirical analysis and rigorous theoretical modeling. First, through systematic reasoning-pattern-level and token-level analysis across the RL training process, we show that while different reasoning patterns exhibit relatively stable success rates during training, RL primarily optimizes a sparse subset of critical tokens, thereby reshaping reasoning pattern distributions to affect model performance. Building on these empirical insights, we develop a theoretical framework to understand the training dynamics of RL with two typical rewards: verifiable reward (RLVR) and model's internal feedback (RLIF). For RLVR, we analyze the training dynamics under two special cases: one where models readily converge to optimal reasoning strategies, and another where optimization becomes challenging, revealing that the base model's reasoning quality is crucial for determining convergence behavior. For RLIF, we examine how internal rewards initially improve model performance but can potentially lead to degradation with continued training. Extensive experiments validate our findings, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical applications of RL in language model enhancement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However, a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness and efficiency. Our code will be available at \href{https://github.com/yangzhch6/TreeRPO}{https://github.com/yangzhch6/TreeRPO}.

Abstract: Role-playing has emerged as an effective technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods primarily rely on prompt engineering, which often lacks stability and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder Role-Playing Steering (SRPS), a novel framework that identifies and manipulates internal model features associated with role-playing behavior. Our approach extracts latent representations from role-play prompts, selects the most relevant features based on activation patterns, and constructs a steering vector that can be injected into the model's residual stream with controllable intensity. Our method enables fine-grained control over role-specific behavior and offers insights into how role information influences internal model activations. Extensive experiments across various reasoning benchmarks and model sizes demonstrate consistent performance gains. Notably, in the zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) setting, the accuracy of Llama3.1-8B on CSQA improves from 31.86% to 39.80%, while Gemma2-9B on SVAMP increases from 37.50% to 45.10%. These results highlight the potential of SRPS to enhance reasoning ability in LLMs, providing better interpretability and stability compared to traditional prompt-based role-playing.

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) is a central challenge in interpretability research. Existing feature interpretability methods often rely on strong assumptions about the structure of representations that may not hold in practice. In this work, we introduce InverseScope, an assumption-light and scalable framework for interpreting neural activations via input inversion. Given a target activation, we define a distribution over inputs that generate similar activations and analyze this distribution to infer the encoded information. To address the inefficiency of sampling in high-dimensional spaces, we propose a novel conditional generation architecture that significantly improves sample efficiency compared to previous method. We further introduce a quantitative evaluation protocol that tests interpretability hypotheses using the feature consistency rate computed over the sampled inputs. InverseScope scales inversion-based interpretability methods to larger models and practical tasks, enabling systematic and quantitative analysis of internal representations in real-world LLMs.

<title>TGRPO :Fine-tuning Vision-Language-Action Model via Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong cross-scenario generalization capabilities in various robotic tasks through large-scale pre-training and task-specific fine-tuning. However, their training paradigm mainly relies on manually collected successful demonstrations, making it difficult to adapt to complex environments when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or execution biases. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a closed-loop optimization framework via active trial-and-error mechanism, it suffers from sparse rewards, high variance, and unstable optimization in long-horizon robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Trajectory-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO), an online RL-based training framework for VLA models. TGRPO leverages task analysis generated by a large language model to automatically construct dense reward functions, providing fine-grained feedback to accelerate convergence and improve credit assignment. The core of our method is a group-based strategy that samples and normalizes multiple trajectories in parallel, reducing variance through relative comparison. By integrating trajectory-level and step-level advantage estimation, TGRPO captures both global and local optimization signals without relying on a value network. Experiments on four task categories of the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO achieves an average success rate of 80.7\%, which is 4.2\% higher than that of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and outperforms other representative RL-based post-training methods.

<title>Towards Robust Real-World Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: A Unified Framework for Dependency, Asynchrony, and Missingness</title>

Abstract: Real-world time series data are inherently multivariate, often exhibiting complex inter-channel dependencies. Each channel is typically sampled at its own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and operational constraints. These characteristics pose three fundamental challenges involving channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of which must be addressed simultaneously to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical settings. However, existing architectures typically address only parts of these challenges in isolation and still rely on simplifying assumptions, leaving unresolved the combined challenges of asynchronous channel sampling, test-time missing blocks, and intricate inter-channel dependencies. To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based forecasting framework with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets reflecting practical settings, along with one private real-world industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.

<title>When Is Diversity Rewarded in Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning?</title>

arXiv:2506.09434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation for when such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing on multi-agent task allocation problems, we study this question from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$ task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneity Gain Parameter Search (HetGPS), a gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous. Across different environments, we show that HetGPS rediscovers the reward regimes predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both validating HetGPS and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity delivers a measurable benefit.

<title>Revisiting Visual Understanding in Multimodal Reasoning through a Lens of Image Perturbation</title>

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they have largely overlooked the importance of visual processing. In a simple yet revealing experiment, we interestingly find that language-only models, when provided with image captions, can achieve comparable or even better performance than MLLMs that consume raw visual inputs. This suggests that current MLLMs may generate accurate visual descriptions but fail to effectively integrate them during reasoning. Motivated by this, we propose a simple visual perturbation framework that enhances perceptual robustness without requiring algorithmic modifications or additional training data. Our approach introduces three targeted perturbations: distractor concatenation, dominance-preserving mixup, and random rotation, that can be easily integrated into existing post-training pipelines including SFT, DPO, and GRPO. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets, we demonstrate consistent improvements in mathematical reasoning performance, with gains comparable to those achieved through algorithmic changes. Additionally, we achieve competitive performance among open-source 7B RL-tuned models by training Qwen2.5-VL-7B with visual perturbation. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze the effectiveness of different perturbation strategies, revealing that each perturbation type contributes uniquely to different aspects of visual reasoning. Our findings highlight the critical role of visual perturbation in multimodal mathematical reasoning: better reasoning begins with better seeing.

<title>Beyond Jailbreaking: Auditing Contextual Privacy in LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: LLM agents have begun to appear as personal assistants, customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures. Moreover, these disclosures go beyond mere explicit disclosure, leaving open avenues for gradual manipulation or sidechannel information leakage. This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that quantifies an agent's susceptibility to these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework is designed to stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives against an iterative probing strategy. Rather than focusing solely on a single disclosure event or purely explicit leakage, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrates the auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by existing single-turn defenses, along with an in-depth longitudinal study of the temporal dynamics of leakage, strategies adopted by adaptive adversaries, and the evolution of adversarial beliefs about sensitive targets. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy across agent implementations.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks. They provide a practical alternative to continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder, quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction, downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations, practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance for future research in this rapidly evolving area.

<title>Enhancing Delta Compression in LLMs via SVD-based Quantization Error Minimization</title>

arXiv:2506.11087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning is a crucial process for adapting large language models (LLMs) to diverse applications. In certain scenarios, like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users. Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the delta weights between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model. However, they exhibit inadequate performance at high compression ratios due to their empirical nature. In this work, we introduce DeltaMix, an adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression framework designed to minimize quantization error in the singular value decomposition (SVD) space without imposing additional assumptions. DeltaMix provides a theoretical justification for the necessity of mixed-precision compression and presents a practical quantization solution that involves solving a 0/1 linear integer programming problem alongside a reconstruction target correction method. Experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks illustrate that DeltaMix consistently outperforms all baseline methods. Notably, on tasks such as AIME2024 and GQA, DeltaMix exceeds the performance of the best baseline, Delta-CoMe, by 22.3\% and 6.1\% for 7B parameter models, respectively.

<title>Meta Pruning via Graph Metanetworks : A Universal Meta Learning Framework for Network Pruning</title>

arXiv:2506.12041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an entirely new meta-learning framework for network pruning. It is a general framework that can be theoretically applied to almost all types of networks with all kinds of pruning and has great generality and transferability. Experiments have shown that it can achieve outstanding results on many popular and representative pruning tasks (including both CNNs and Transformers). Unlike all prior works that either rely on fixed, hand-crafted criteria to prune in a coarse manner, or employ learning to prune ways that require special training during each pruning and lack generality. Our framework can learn complex pruning rules automatically via a neural network (metanetwork) and has great generality that can prune without any special training. More specifically, we introduce the newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning strategy automatically and can transform a network that is hard to prune into another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained, our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and some standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yewei-Liu/MetaPruning.

Abstract: Every individual carries a unique and personal life story shaped by their memories and experiences. However, these memories are often scattered and difficult to organize into a coherent narrative, a challenge that defines the task of autobiography writing. Existing conversational writing assistants tend to rely on generic user interactions and pre-defined guidelines, making it difficult for these systems to capture personal memories and develop a complete biography over time. We introduce StorySage, a user-driven software system designed to meet the needs of a diverse group of users that supports a flexible conversation and a structured approach to autobiography writing. Powered by a multi-agent framework composed of an Interviewer, Session Scribe, Planner, Section Writer, and Session Coordinator, our system iteratively collects user memories, updates their autobiography, and plans for future conversations. In experimental simulations, StorySage demonstrates its ability to navigate multiple sessions and capture user memories across many conversations. User studies (N=28) highlight how StorySage maintains improved conversational flow, narrative completeness, and higher user satisfaction when compared to a baseline. In summary, StorySage contributes both a novel architecture for autobiography writing and insights into how multi-agent systems can enhance human-AI creative partnerships.

Abstract: Counterfactual generation aims to simulate realistic hypothetical outcomes under causal interventions. Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for this task, combining DDIM inversion with conditional generation and classifier-free guidance (CFG). In this work, we identify a key limitation of CFG for counterfactual generation: it prescribes a global guidance scale for all attributes, leading to significant spurious changes in inferred counterfactuals. To mitigate this, we propose Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG), a flexible and model-agnostic guidance technique that enables attribute-wise control following a causal graph. DCFG is implemented via a simple attribute-split embedding strategy that disentangles semantic inputs, enabling selective guidance on user-defined attribute groups.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures traditionally employ softmax to compute attention weights, which produces dense distributions over all tokens in a sequence. While effective in many settings, this density has been shown to be detrimental for tasks that demand precise focus on fixed-size patterns: as sequence length increases, non-informative tokens accumulate attention probability mass, leading to dispersion and representational collapse. We show in this paper that dynamically sparse attention mechanisms using $\alpha$-entmax can avoid these issues, due to their ability to assign exact zeros to irrelevant tokens. Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive-Scalable Entmax (ASEntmax), which endows $\alpha$-entmax with a learnable temperature parameter, allowing the attention distribution to interpolate between sparse (pattern-focused) and dense (softmax-like) regimes. Our empirical evaluation on synthetic tasks and language modeling demonstrates that ASEntmax substantially outperforms softmax, scalable softmax, and fixed-temperature $\alpha$-entmax baselines, achieving up to 1000$\times$ length extrapolation on synthetic benchmarks and superior long-context generalization on language modeling while preserving short-context performance, including better perplexity trends and higher retrieval accuracies at 8$\times$ training length.

Abstract: Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to process dense video data. We propose a shift from this video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich descriptions and contextual cues contains sufficient information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To demonstrate this, we employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics for spotting actions in soccer matches. Our experiments show that this language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match events coming close to state-of-the-art video-based spotters while using zero video processing compute and similar amount of time to process the entire match.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, its performance is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying human preference data. To address this bottleneck, prior work has explored various data selection strategies, but these methods often overlook the impact of the evolving states of the language model during the DPO process. %including active querying, response pair selection, and data pre-selection. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem: Sample Scheduling for DPO, which aims to dynamically and adaptively schedule training samples based on the model's evolving states throughout preference optimization. To solve this problem, we propose SamS, an efficient and effective algorithm that adaptively selects samples in each training batch based on the LLM's learning feedback to maximize the potential generalization performance. Notably, without modifying the core DPO algorithm, simply integrating SamS significantly improves performance across tasks, with minimal additional computational overhead. This work points to a promising new direction for improving LLM alignment through more effective utilization of fixed preference datasets.

<title>From Drawings to Decisions: A Hybrid Vision-Language Framework for Parsing 2D Engineering Drawings into Structured Manufacturing Knowledge</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17374</link>

Abstract: Efficient and accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering drawings is essential for advancing digital manufacturing workflows. Such information includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&amp;T), measures, material specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and labor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts, engineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable outputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that integrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a transformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies YOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB) patches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned, lightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D mechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is trained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These are parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are lightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited computational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated dataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a comparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four key metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2% recall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a case study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports downstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing the practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing interpretation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks. Nevertheless, they still pose notable safety risks due to potential misuse for malicious purposes. Jailbreaking, which seeks to induce models to generate harmful content through single-turn or multi-turn attacks, plays a crucial role in uncovering underlying security vulnerabilities. However, prior methods, including sophisticated multi-turn approaches, often struggle to adapt to the evolving dynamics of dialogue as interactions progress. To address this challenge, we propose \ours (JailBreaking via \textbf{G}lobally \textbf{R}efining and \textbf{A}daptively \textbf{F}abricating), a novel multi-turn jailbreaking method that globally refines the attack trajectory at each interaction. In addition, we actively fabricate model responses to suppress safety-related warnings, thereby increasing the likelihood of eliciting harmful outputs in subsequent queries. Extensive experiments across six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach compared to existing single-turn and multi-turn jailbreaking methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Ytang520/Multi-Turn_jailbreaking_Global-Refinment_and_Active-Fabrication.

<title>Improving Black-Box Generative Attacks via Generator Semantic Consistency</title>

Abstract: Transfer attacks optimize on a surrogate and deploy to a black-box target. While iterative optimization attacks in this paradigm are limited by their per-input cost limits efficiency and scalability due to multistep gradient updates for each input, generative attacks alleviate these by producing adversarial examples in a single forward pass at test time. However, current generative attacks still adhere to optimizing surrogate losses (e.g., feature divergence) and overlook the generator's internal dynamics, underexploring how the generator's internal representations shape transferable perturbations. To address this, we enforce semantic consistency by aligning the early generator's intermediate features to an EMA teacher, stabilizing object-aligned representations and improving black-box transfer without inference-time overhead. To ground the mechanism, we quantify semantic stability as the standard deviation of foreground IoU between cluster-derived activation masks and foreground masks across generator blocks, and observe reduced semantic drift under our method. For more reliable evaluation, we also introduce Accidental Correction Rate (ACR) to separate inadvertent corrections from intended misclassifications, complementing the inherent blind spots in traditional Attack Success Rate (ASR), Fooling Rate (FR), and Accuracy metrics. Across architectures, domains, and tasks, our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing generative attacks with consistent improvements in black-box transfer, while maintaining test-time efficiency.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative model designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks, including text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2 achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation, also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code, datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this field.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use in fact-checking, moderation, and high-stakes decision-making, large language models (LLMs) remain poorly understood as judges of truth. This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs' veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true, regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models (o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning abilities in domains like mathematics, coding, and scientific problem-solving, yet their potential for ranking tasks, where prime examples include retrieval, recommender systems, and LLM routing, remains underexplored. Ranking requires complex reasoning across heterogeneous candidates, but existing LLM-based rankers are often domain-specific, tied to fixed backbones, and lack iterative refinement, limiting their ability to fully exploit LLMs' reasoning potential. To address these challenges, we propose R1-Ranker, a reasoning-incentive framework built on reinforcement learning, with two complementary designs: DRanker, which generates full rankings in one shot, and IRanker, which decomposes ranking into an iterative elimination process with step-wise rewards to encourage deeper reasoning. We evaluate unified R1-Rankers on nine datasets spanning recommendation, routing, and passage ranking, showing that IRanker-3B consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses larger 7B models on some tasks, and yields a 15.7% average relative improvement. Ablation and generalization experiments further confirm the critical role of reinforcement learning and iterative reasoning, with IRanker-3B improving zero-shot performance by over 9% on out-of-domain tasks and reasoning traces boosting other LLMs by up to 22.87%. These results demonstrate that unifying diverse ranking tasks with a single reasoning-driven foundation model is both effective and essential for advancing LLM reasoning in ranking scenarios.

arXiv:2506.23085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore a multi-modal approach to enhancing live broadcast engagement by developing a short video recommendation system that incorporates Multi-modal Graph Convolutional Networks (MMGCN) with user preferences. To provide personalized recommendations tailored to individual interests, the proposed system considers user interaction data, video content features, and contextual information. With the aid of a hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques, the system can capture nuanced relationships between users, video attributes, and engagement patterns. Three datasets are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system: Kwai, TikTok, and MovieLens. Compared to baseline models, such as DeepFM, Wide & Deep, LightGBM, and XGBoost, the proposed MMGCN-based model shows superior performance. A notable feature of the proposed model is that it outperforms all baseline methods in capturing diverse user preferences and making accurate, personalized recommendations, resulting in a Kwai F1 score of 0.574, a Tiktok F1 score of 0.506, and a MovieLens F1 score of 0.197. We emphasize the importance of multi-modal integration and user-centric approaches in advancing recommender systems, emphasizing the role they play in enhancing content discovery and audience interaction on live broadcast platforms.

Abstract: Diverse decoding of large language models is crucial for applications requiring multiple semantically distinct responses, yet existing methods primarily achieve lexical rather than semantic diversity. This limitation significantly constrains Best-of-N strategies, group-based reinforcement learning, and data synthesis. While temperature sampling and diverse beam search modify token distributions or apply n-gram penalties, they fail to ensure meaningful semantic differentiation. We introduce Semantic-guided Diverse Decoding (SemDiD), operating directly in embedding space that balances quality with diversity through three complementary mechanisms: orthogonal directional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased probability assessment. SemDiD harmonizes these competing objectives using adaptive gain functions and constraint optimization, ensuring both quality thresholds and maximal semantic differentiation. Experiments show SemDiD consistently outperforms existing methods, improving Best-of-N coverage by 1.4-5.2% across diverse tasks and accelerating RLHF training convergence by 15% while increasing accuracy by up to 2.1%.

Abstract: Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including in large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties such as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known to enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist other quantitative and general principles of data selection that can consistently improve performance, especially for complicated tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly distributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance. Specifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads to a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by $h_{\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\min}$ can slow down the training dynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the approximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\min}$ increases. Our analysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including transformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further provides theoretical justification for the use of residual connection and function composition in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct comprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings, including different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by maximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves comparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Self-improvement is among the most prominent techniques within the realm of large language models (LLM), aiming to enhance the LLM performance without relying on external data. Despite its significance, generally how LLM performances evolve during the self-improvement process remains underexplored. In this paper, we theoretically model the training dynamics of self-improvement via the concept of solver-verifier gap. This is inspired by the conjecture that the performance enhancement of self-improvement stems from the gap between LLM's solver capability and verifier capability. Based on the theoretical framework, we further show how to model the entire training trajectory. This framework allows quantifying the capability limit of self-improvement by fitting the theoretical model to the experiment results. We empirically validate the effectiveness of the theoretical framework on various LLMs and datasets. Beyond self-improvement, we extend our analysis to investigate how external data influences these dynamics within the framework. Notably, we find that under limited external data regimes, such external data can be utilized at any stage without significantly affecting final performances, which accords with the empirical observations.

Abstract: Iterative heuristics are widely recognized as state-of-the-art for Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). In this work, we exploit a critical observation: a large portion of the solution remains stable, i.e., unchanged across search iterations, causing redundant computations, especially for large-scale VRPs with long subtours. To address this, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA) decomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers. FSTA preserves stable solution segments during the search, aggregates nodes within each segment into fixed hypernodes, and focuses the search only on unstable portions. Yet, a key challenge lies in identifying which segments should be aggregated. To this end, we introduce Learning-to-Segment (L2Seg), a novel neural framework to intelligently differentiate potentially stable and unstable portions for FSTA decomposition. We present three L2Seg variants: non-autoregressive (globally comprehensive but locally indiscriminate), autoregressive (locally refined but globally deficient), and their synergy. Empirical results on CVRP and VRPTW show that L2Seg accelerates state-of-the-art solvers by 2x to 7x. We further provide in-depth analysis showing why synergy achieves the best performance. Notably, L2Seg is compatible with traditional, learning-based, and hybrid solvers, while supporting various VRPs.

arXiv:2507.01076v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NP-complete mutual-visibility (MV) problem currently lacks empirical analysis on its practical behaviour despite theoretical studies. This paper addresses this gap by implementing and evaluating three distinct algorithms -- a direct random heuristic, a hypergraph-based approximation, and a genetic algorithm -- on diverse synthetic graph datasets, including those with analytically known $\mu(G)$ values and general graph models. Our results demonstrate that for smaller graphs, the algorithms consistently achieve MV set sizes aligning with theoretical bounds. However, for larger instances, achieved solution sizes notably diverge from theoretical limits; this, combined with the absence of tight bounds, complicates absolute quality assessment. Nevertheless, validation on known optimal graphs showed the Genetic Algorithm and other heuristics empirically performing best among tested methods.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method. Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize reasoning steps. The code is available at https://github.com/wenquanlu/huginn-latent-cot.

<title>Model Collapse Is Not a Bug but a Feature in Machine Unlearning for LLMs</title>

Abstract: Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they seek to remove by incorporating it into their fine-tuning data. We argue this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we propose a novel unlearning method-Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information from model outputs. Our central insight is that model collapse can be leveraged for machine unlearning by deliberately triggering it for data we aim to remove. We theoretically analyze that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the model unlearns the data targeted for removal. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes three key limitations of existing unlearning methods that explicitly optimize on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from model outputs while preserving general model utility. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to align model outputs with individuals' unique preferences and opinions. While recent efforts have implemented various personalization methods, a unified theoretical framework that can systematically understand the drivers of effective personalization is still lacking. In this work, we integrate the well-established cognitive dual-memory model into LLM personalization, by mirroring episodic memory to historical user engagements and semantic memory to long-term, evolving user beliefs. Specifically, we systematically investigate memory instantiations and introduce a unified framework, PRIME, using episodic and semantic memory mechanisms. We further augment PRIME with a novel personalized thinking capability inspired by the slow thinking strategy. Moreover, recognizing the absence of suitable benchmarks, we introduce a dataset using Change My View (CMV) from Reddit, specifically designed to evaluate long-context personalization. Extensive experiments validate PRIME's effectiveness across both long- and short-context scenarios. Further analysis confirms that PRIME effectively captures dynamic personalization beyond mere popularity biases.

Abstract: Personalized text generation has become crucial for adapting language models to diverse and evolving users' personal context across cultural, temporal, and contextual dimensions. While existing methods often rely on centralized fine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time adaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This limitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized user-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the generation quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we present CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time personalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in leveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic outputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs. Specifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning problem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits within the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by transmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate vectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on various personalized generation tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer effectively assists LLMs in generating personalized content by leveraging locally stored user profiles and histories, ensuring privacy preservation through on-device data processing while maintaining acceptable computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models, we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference (DI).

<title>Mitigating Watermark Forgery in Generative Models via Randomized Key Selection</title>

arXiv:2507.07871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Watermarking enables GenAI providers to verify whether content was generated by their models. A watermark is a hidden signal in the content, whose presence can be detected using a secret watermark key. A core security threat are forgery attacks, where adversaries insert the provider's watermark into content \emph{not} produced by the provider, potentially damaging their reputation and undermining trust. Existing defenses resist forgery by embedding many watermarks with multiple keys into the same content, which can degrade model utility. However, forgery remains a threat when attackers can collect sufficiently many watermarked samples. We propose a defense that is provably forgery-resistant \emph{independent} of the number of watermarked content collected by the attacker, provided they cannot easily distinguish watermarks from different keys. Our scheme does not further degrade model utility. We randomize the watermark key selection for each query and accept content as genuine only if a watermark is detected by \emph{exactly} one key. We focus on the image and text modalities, but our defense is modality-agnostic, since it treats the underlying watermarking method as a black-box. Our method provably bounds the attacker's success rate and we empirically observe a reduction from near-perfect success rates to only $2\%$ at negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate the intriguing ability to perform unseen tasks via in-context learning. However, it remains unclear what mechanisms inside the model drive such task-level generalization. In this work, we approach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3, 2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function as a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as path patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a function induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from standard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the structure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it to a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1 function is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which emits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function induction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic tasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8 addition. Overall, our findings offer deeper insights into how reusable and composable structures within language models enable task-level generalization.

Abstract: We present BenchRL-QAS, a unified benchmarking framework for reinforcement learning (RL) in quantum architecture search (QAS) across a spectrum of variational quantum algorithm tasks on 2- to 8-qubit systems. Our study systematically evaluates 9 different RL agents, including both value-based and policy-gradient methods, on quantum problems such as variational eigensolver, quantum state diagonalization, variational quantum classification (VQC), and state preparation, under both noiseless and noisy execution settings. To ensure fair comparison, we propose a weighted ranking metric that integrates accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and training time. Results demonstrate that no single RL method dominates universally, the performance dependents on task type, qubit count, and noise conditions providing strong evidence of no free lunch principle in RL-QAS. As a byproduct we observe that a carefully chosen RL algorithm in RL-based VQC outperforms baseline VQCs. BenchRL-QAS establishes the most extensive benchmark for RL-based QAS to date, codes and experimental made publicly available for reproducibility and future advances.

Abstract: Scaling general-purpose manipulation to new robot embodiments remains challenging: each platform typically needs large, homogeneous demonstrations, and pixel-to-action VLA pipelines typically degenerate under background and viewpoint shifts. In this paper, we present Vidar, a prior-driven, low-shot adaptation paradigm that replaces most embodiment-specific data with transferable video priors. Vidar consists of an embodied video diffusion model as the generalizable prior and a masked inverse dynamics model (MIDM) adapter based on a key decoupling of the policy. The embodied diffusion model is pre-trained on Internet-scale videos and then domain-adapted to 750K multi-view trajectories from three real-world robot platforms using a unified observation space encoding robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. The MIDM module learns action-relevant pixel masks without dense labels, grounding the prior into the target embodiment's action space while suppressing distractors. Crucially, the generative video prior models the distribution of plausible, temporally coherent interactions, implicitly capturing affordances, contact dynamics, and physical consistency from massive unlabeled video. This shifts the challenge from collecting large amounts of new robot data to efficiently aligning a rich prior with a new embodiment. With only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot (1% of typical data), Vidar outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines and generalizes to unseen tasks, backgrounds, and camera layouts. Our results suggest a scalable recipe for "one prior, many embodiments": strong, inexpensive video priors + minimal on-robot alignment.

Abstract: Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided generation, and hierarchical text generation. HdLM outperforms all baselines on WoS, DBpedia, ESconv, EmpatheticDialogues, and several cognitive tests. We also provide thorough theoretical analysis to validate the convergence and computational savings of our methodology. This study suggests the possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

<title>Learning to summarize user information for personalized reinforcement learning from human feedback</title>

Abstract: As everyday use cases of large language model (LLM) AI assistants have expanded, it is becoming increasingly important to personalize responses to align to different users' preferences and goals. While reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is effective at improving LLMs to be generally more helpful and fluent, it does not account for variability across users, as it models the entire user population with a single reward model, meaning it assumes that everyone's preferences are the same. We present a novel framework, Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to learn to produce text-based summaries of each user's preferences, characteristics, and past conversations. These summaries condition the reward model, enabling it to make personalized predictions about the types of responses valued by each user. Both the user-summarization model and reward model are trained simultaneously, creating an online co-adaptation loop. We show that in contrast to the standard Bradley-Terry model, summaries produced by PLUS capture diverse aspects of user preferences, achieving a 11-77% improvement in reward model accuracy. Key strengths of PLUS are: (1) robust performance with new users and conversation topics, achieving a 25% improvement over the best personalized RLHF technique; (2) zero-shot personalization with state-of-the-art proprietary models like GPT-4 (e.g., PLUS-summary-conditioned responses achieved a 72% win rate compared to 28% for default GPT-4o); (3) learning from flexible user contexts beyond preference labels, and (4) interpretable representation of users, enabling greater transparency and user control in pluralistic LLM alignment.

<title>GRID: Scalable Task-Agnostic Prompt-Based Continual Learning for Language Models</title>

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning (CL) provides a parameter-efficient approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) across task sequences. However, most existing methods rely on task-aware inference and maintain a growing set of task-specific prompts, which introduces two major challenges: (1) severe performance degradation on earlier tasks under task-agnostic inference, and (2) limited scalability due to prompt memory accumulation as task sequences grow. In this paper, we present GRID, a unified framework designed to address these challenges. GRID incorporates a decoding mechanism that enhances backward transfer by leveraging representative inputs, automatic task identification, and constrained decoding. Furthermore, it employs a gradient-guided prompt selection strategy to compress less informative prompts into a single aggregated representation, ensuring scalable and memory-efficient continual learning. Extensive experiments on long-sequence and negative transfer benchmarks show that GRID improves average accuracy and backward transfer, achieves competitive forward transfer, and substantially reduces prompt memory usage.

Abstract: The pursuit of general-purpose artificial intelligence depends on large language models (LLMs) that can handle both structured reasoning and open-ended generation. We present Omni-Thinker, a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework that scales LLMs across diverse tasks by combining hybrid rewards with backward-transfer-guided scheduling. Hybrid rewards integrate rule-based verifiable signals with preference-based evaluations from an LLM-as-a-Judge, enabling learning in both deterministic and subjective domains. Our scheduler orders tasks according to accuracy backward transfer (BWT), reducing forgetting and improving multi-task performance. Experiments across four domains show gains of 6.2% over joint training and 12.4% over model merging. Moreover, we demonstrate that simple assumptions on accuracy transfer yield accurate predictions of curriculum outcomes, with entropy dynamics explaining deviations due to generative tasks. These findings underscore the importance of BWT-aware scheduling and hybrid supervision for scaling RL-based post-training toward general-purpose LLMs.

Abstract: As foundation models grow rapidly in capability and deployment, evaluating their scientific understanding becomes increasingly critical. Existing science benchmarks have made progress towards broad Range, wide Reach, and high Rigor, yet they often face two major challenges: data leakage risks that compromise benchmarking validity, and evaluation inefficiency due to large-scale testing. To address these issues, we introduce the Ever-Evolving Science Exam (EESE), a dynamic benchmark designed to reliably assess scientific capabilities in foundation models. Our approach consists of two components: 1) a non-public EESE-Pool with over 100K expertly constructed science instances (question-answer pairs) across 5 disciplines and 500+ subfields, built through a multi-stage pipeline ensuring Range, Reach, and Rigor, 2) a periodically updated 500-instance subset EESE, sampled and validated to enable leakage-resilient, low-overhead evaluations. Experiments on 32 open- and closed-source models demonstrate that EESE effectively differentiates the strengths and weaknesses of models in scientific fields and cognitive dimensions. Overall, EESE provides a robust, scalable, and forward-compatible solution for science benchmark design, offering a realistic measure of how well foundation models handle science questions.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs, where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight, adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce Moving Out, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS (Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI collaboration. The project page is available at https://live-robotics-uva.github.io/movingout_ai/.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models achieve remarkable performance, yet a unified theory explaining their internal mechanisms, how training shapes their representations, and enables complex behaviors, remains elusive. We introduce a new analytical framework that models the single-step generation process as a composition of information-processing stages using the language of Markov categories. This compositional perspective provides a unified mathematical language to connect three critical aspects of language modeling that are typically studied in isolation: the training objective, the geometry of the learned representation space, and practical model capabilities. First, our framework provides a precise information-theoretic rationale for the success of multi-token prediction methods like speculative decoding, quantifying the information surplus a model's hidden state contains about tokens beyond the immediate next one. Second, we clarify how the standard negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective compels the model to learn not just the next word, but also the data's intrinsic conditional uncertainty, a process we formalize using categorical entropy. Our central result shows that, under a linear-softmax head with bounded features, minimizing NLL induces spectral alignment: the learned representation space aligns with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator. This work presents a powerful new lens for understanding how information flows through a model and how the training objective shapes its internal geometry.

Abstract: Recent ObjectNav systems credit large language models (LLMs) for sizable zero-shot gains, yet it remains unclear how much comes from language versus geometry. We revisit this question by re-evaluating an instruction-guided pipeline, InstructNav, under a detector-controlled setting and introducing two training-free variants that only alter the action value map: a geometry-only Frontier Proximity Explorer (FPE) and a lightweight Semantic-Heuristic Frontier (SHF) that polls the LLM with simple frontier votes. Across HM3D and MP3D, FPE matches or exceeds the detector-controlled instruction follower while using no API calls and running faster; SHF attains comparable accuracy with a smaller, localized language prior. These results suggest that carefully engineered frontier geometry accounts for much of the reported progress, and that language is most reliable as a light heuristic rather than an end-to-end planner.

Abstract: Discovering scaling laws for predicting model performance at scale is a fundamental and open-ended challenge, mostly reliant on slow, case specific human experimentation. To investigate the potential for LLMs to automate this process, we collect over 5,000 experiments from existing literature and curate seven diverse scaling law discovery tasks. While existing agents struggle to produce accurate law formulas, this paper introduces SLDAgent, an evolution-based agent that co-optimize the scaling law model and the parameters, enabling it to autonomously explore complex relationships between variables. For the first time, we demonstrates that SLDAgent can automatically discover laws that exhibit consistently more accurate extrapolation than their established, human-derived counterparts across all tasks. Through comprehensive analysis, we elucidate why these discovered laws are superior and verify their practical utility in both pretraining and finetuning applications. This work establishes a new paradigm for agentic scientific discovery, showing that AI systems can understand their own scaling behavior, and can contribute novel and practical knowledge back to the research community.

arXiv:2508.02912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end, with agents generating messages and actions concurrently. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), to simulate future states. Agents then communicate a summary of this plan. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.

Abstract: Despite their success, modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. These shortcomings can be traced to a lack of inductive biases that reflect the inherent geometric structure of the visual world. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural and computational principles,which evolved to internalize these structures,may offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision. This paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex. VCNet is framed as a geometric framework that emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation for learning disentangled representations, and top-down predictive feedback for representation refinement. We interpret these mechanisms through the lens of geometry and dynamical systems, positing that they guide the learning of structured, low-dimensional neural manifolds. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset, which probes sensitivity to natural textures, and a light field image classification task, which requires processing higher-dimensional visual data. Our results show that VCNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset, surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that integrating high-level neuroscientific principles, viewed through a geometric lens, can lead to more efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in machine learning.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising, training-free approach for enhancing large language model (LLM) performance. However, the efficacy of existing methods, such as Best-of-N and Self-Consistency, is fundamentally constrained by the dominant single test-time scaling (STTS) paradigm, which relies on a single LLM agent interacting with a single reward model (SA-SR). Inspired by recent work showing that collective methods can surpass the performance ceiling of individual models, we introduce Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). First, we systematically investigate three primary interaction paradigms of existing multiple models: single-agent-multi-reward (SA-MR), multi-agent-single-reward (MA-SR), and multi-agent-multi-reward (MA-MR). Extensive experiments reveal that the MA-MR paradigm is consistently superior. Based on this finding, we further propose CTTS-MM, a novel framework that operationalizes multi-agent and multi-reward collaboration. CTTS-MM integrates two key technical contributions: (1) for agent collaboration, an Agent Collaboration Search (ACS) that identifies the most effective combination of LLMs from a candidate pool; and (2) for reward model collaboration, a Mixture of Reward Models (MoR) strategy that leverages a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) algorithm to select the optimal ensemble. Evaluations across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that CTTS-MM significantly outperforms leading STTS methods (+4.82% over Best-of-N) and surpasses even flagship proprietary LLMs (+7.06% over GPT-4.1) and open-source LLMs. These results highlight the substantial potential of collective scaling to push the frontier of LLM inference. Code will be released at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.

arXiv:2508.04664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs' capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore, and (3) precise search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental evaluation on diverse long-context benchmarks demonstrates that Sculptor significantly improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent tool-calling and instruction-following capabilities. To further optimize these strategies, we introduce a novel dynamic context-aware reinforcement learning (RL) approach, advancing the training of an agent that actively modifies its own conversational history. By enabling Active Context Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies, rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process, their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol, an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1) a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models (Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and performance for property prediction. We release the code in https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

<title>Beyond Prompt-Induced Lies: Investigating LLM Deception on Benign Prompts</title>

arXiv:2508.06361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in reasoning, planning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness critical. A significant and underexplored risk is intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately fabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective. Existing studies typically induce deception by explicitly setting a hidden objective through prompting or fine-tuning, which may not reflect real-world human-LLM interactions. Moving beyond such human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated deception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth, we propose a framework based on Contact Searching Questions~(CSQ). This framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological principles to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive Intention Score, measures the model's bias toward a hidden objective. The second, the Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's internal belief and its expressed output. Evaluating 16 leading LLMs, we find that both metrics rise in parallel and escalate with task difficulty for most models. Moreover, increasing model capacity does not always reduce deception, posing a significant challenge for future LLM development.

Abstract: The conversational capabilities of large language models hold significant promise for enabling scalable and interactive tutoring. While prior research has primarily examined their ability to generate Socratic questions, it often overlooks a critical aspect: adaptively guiding learners in accordance with their cognitive states. This study moves beyond question generation to emphasize instructional guidance capability. We ask: Can LLMs emulate expert tutors who dynamically adjust strategies in response to learners' states? To investigate this, we propose GuideEval, a benchmark grounded in authentic educational dialogues that evaluates pedagogical guidance through a three-phase behavioral framework: (1) Perception, inferring learner states; (2) Orchestration, adapting instructional strategies; and (3) Elicitation, stimulating proper reflections. Empirical results indicate that existing LLMs often fail to provide effective adaptive scaffolding when learners experience confusion or require redirection. To complement the quantitative evaluation, we conduct a detailed failure case analysis, providing an intuitive understanding of these shortcomings. Furthermore, we introduce a behavior-guided finetuning strategy that leverages behavior-prompted instructional dialogues, substantially enhancing guidance performance. By shifting the focus from isolated content evaluation to learner-centered state-aware interaction, our work advocates a more dialogic paradigm for evaluating Socratic LLMs.

Abstract: Quantization method plays a crucial role in improving model efficiency and reducing deployment costs, enabling the widespread application of deep learning models on resource-constrained devices. However, the quantization process inevitably introduces accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Mixture of Quantization Experts( abbr. MoQE), a quantization inference framework based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, aiming to jointly improve the performance of quantization models. MoQE combines multiple quantization variants of one full-precision model as specialized "quantization experts" and dynamically routes input data to the most suitable expert based on its characteristics. MoQE alleviates the performance degradation commonly seen in single quantization models through specialization quantization expert models. We design lightweight, structure-aware router models tailored for both CV and NLP tasks.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ) dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8 categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation, (ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and (iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low resource settings.

<title>BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware step distillation paradigm, built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than treating it as a separate compression step and features fast convergence. We validate BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B, and our framework demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a 50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from 0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations.

Abstract: We introduce G-CUT3R, a novel feed-forward approach for guided 3D scene reconstruction that enhances the CUT3R model by integrating prior information. Unlike existing feed-forward methods that rely solely on input images, our method leverages auxiliary data, such as depth, camera calibrations, or camera positions, commonly available in real-world scenarios. We propose a lightweight modification to CUT3R, incorporating a dedicated encoder for each modality to extract features, which are fused with RGB image tokens via zero convolution. This flexible design enables seamless integration of any combination of prior information during inference. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including 3D reconstruction and other multi-view tasks, our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements, showing its ability to effectively utilize available priors while maintaining compatibility with varying input modalities.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of image generation techniques, robust forgery detection has become increasingly imperative to ensure the trustworthiness of digital media. Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of pre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the misalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the model's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction learning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing discrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery feature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies to minimize redundant forgery information. Experiments conducted on two standard image forgery datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SDD, which achieves superior results compared to existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/wzy1111111/SSD.

Abstract: In classical AI, perception relies on learning state-based representations, while planning, which can be thought of as temporal reasoning over action sequences, is typically achieved through search. We study whether such reasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both perceptual and temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning, despite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure due to its reliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Combinatorial Representations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative sampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate temporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex temporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube. In particular, for the Rubik's Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial states and allow it to solve the puzzle using fewer search steps than BestFS, though with longer solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that efficiently solves arbitrary Cube states using only learned representations, without relying on an external search algorithm.

<title>Depth-Breadth Synergy in RLVR: Unlocking LLM Reasoning Gains with Adaptive Exploration</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions: Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance. Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the reasoning power of RLVR.

Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be procured. We investigate whether example difficulty affects GRPO training effectiveness by comparing selection strategies (easy, medium, hard, random) across multiple models and reasoning tasks. Training on the hardest 10\% of examples (those where the base model fails most often) yields dramatic performance gains up to 47\%, while easy examples produce minimal improvements of 3-15\%. This occurs because GRPO requires outcome variance to generate learning signals; hard examples maintain mixed success/failure outcomes throughout training while easy examples quickly converge to consistent success, eliminating learning opportunities. Moreover, models trained on hard examples show superior out-of-distribution generalization, with only hard-trained models achieving meaningful gains on the AIME2025 benchmark. Our findings provide clear guidance: when budget-constrained, prioritize collecting and annotating examples where your base model struggles, as these drive nearly all learning value in GRPO fine-tuning

Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in audio, vision and language, yet their potential for general machine signal modeling with arbitrary sampling rates-covering acoustic, vibration, and other industrial sensor data-remains under-explored. In this work, we propose a novel foundation model ECHO that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with frequency positional embeddings, enabling spectral localization across arbitrary sampling configurations. Moreover, the model incorporates sliding patches to support inputs of variable length without padding or cropping, producing a concise embedding that retains both temporal and spectral fidelity and naturally extends to streaming scenarios. We evaluate our method on various kinds of machine signal datasets, including previous DCASE task 2 challenges (2020-2025), and widely-used industrial signal corpora. Experimental results demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance in machine signal anomaly detection and fault classification, confirming the effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed model. We open-sourced ECHO on https://github.com/yucongzh/ECHO.

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models, which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3) designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models, such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B total and 2.2B activated parameters.

Abstract: Despite extensive efforts to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and safety rules, jailbreak attacks that exploit certain vulnerabilities continuously emerge, highlighting the need to strengthen existing LLMs with additional safety properties to defend against these attacks. However, tuning large models has become increasingly resource intensive and may have difficulty ensuring consistent performance. We introduce Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding (SSD), a lightweight decoding-time approach that equips LLMs with the desired safety property while accelerating inference. We assume that there exists a small language model that possesses this desired property. SSD integrates speculative sampling during decoding and leverages the match ratio between the small and composite models to quantify jailbreak risks. This enables SSD to dynamically switch between decoding schemes to prioritize utility or safety, to handle the challenge of different model capacities. The output token is then sampled from a new distribution that combines the distributions of the original and the small models. Experimental results show that SSD successfully equips the large model with the desired safety property, and also allows the model to remain helpful to benign queries. Furthermore, SSD accelerates the inference time, thanks to the speculative sampling design.

<title>Type-Compliant Adaptation Cascades: Adapting Programmatic LM Workflows to Data</title>

Abstract: Reliably composing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, multi-step workflows remains a significant challenge. The dominant paradigm -- optimizing discrete prompts in a pipeline -- is notoriously brittle and struggles to enforce the formal compliance required for structured tasks. We introduce Type-Compliant Adaptation Cascades (TACs), a framework that recasts workflow adaptation as learning typed probabilistic programs. TACs treat the entire workflow, which is composed of parameter-efficiently adapted LLMs and deterministic logic, as an unnormalized joint distribution. This enables principled, gradient-based training even with latent intermediate structures. We provide theoretical justification for our tractable optimization objective, proving that the optimization bias vanishes as the model learns type compliance. Empirically, TACs significantly outperform state-of-the-art prompt-optimization baselines. Gains are particularly pronounced on structured tasks, improving FinQA from $12.0\%$ to $24.7\%$ for a Qwen 3 8B model, MGSM-SymPy from $57.1\%$ to $75.9\%$ for a Gemma 2 27B model, MGSM from $1.6\%$ to $27.3\%$, and MuSR from $36.5\%$ to $62.6\%$ for a Gemma 7B model. TACs offer a robust and theoretically grounded paradigm for developing reliable, task-compliant LLM systems.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM alignment.

arXiv:2508.19282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the timeliness of knowledge updates and the factual accuracy of responses in large language models. However, incorporating a large number of retrieved documents significantly increases input length, leading to higher computational costs. Existing approaches to document compression tailored for RAG often degrade task performance, as they typically rely on predefined heuristics in the absence of clear compression guidelines. These heuristics fail to ensure that the compressed content effectively supports downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CORE, a novel method for lossless context compression in RAG. CORE is optimized end-to-end and does not depend on predefined compression labels, which are often impractical to obtain. Instead, it leverages downstream task performance as a feedback signal, iteratively refining the compression policy to enhance task effectiveness. Extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CORE. With a high compression ratio of 3%, CORE not only prevents performance degradation compared to including full documents (i.e., without compression) but also improves the average Exact Match (EM) score by 3.3 points. The code for CORE will be released soon.

Abstract: In the realm of education, student evaluation holds equal significance to imparting knowledge. To be evaluated, students usually need to go through text-based academic assessment methods. Instructors need to make a diverse set of questions that need to be fair for all students to prove their adequacy over a particular topic. This can prove to be quite challenging as they may need to manually go through several different lecture materials. Our objective is to make this whole process much easier by implementing Automatic Question Answer Generation(AQAG), using a fine-tuned generative LLM. For tailoring the instructor's preferred question style (MCQ, conceptual, or factual questions), Prompt Engineering (PE) is being utilized. In this research, we propose to leverage unsupervised learning methods in NLP, primarily focusing on the English language. This approach empowers the base Meta-Llama 2-7B model to integrate the RACE dataset as training data for the fine-tuning process. Creating a customized model that will offer efficient solutions for educators, instructors, and individuals engaged in text-based evaluations. A reliable and efficient tool for generating questions and answers can free up valuable time and resources, thus streamlining their evaluation processes.

arXiv:2509.00031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization is an effective technique to reduce the deployment cost of large language models (LLMs), and post-training quantization (PTQ) has been widely studied due to its efficiency. However, existing PTQ methods are limited by their inability to fine-tune model parameters and often suffer significant accuracy loss in low-bit scenarios. Quantization-aware training (QAT) provides a more principled solution, but its reliance on backpropagation incurs prohibitive memory costs, limiting its practicality for LLM deployment. To address these challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT framework that supports both weight and activation quantization. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate backpropagation, substantially reducing computational and memory overhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. We further introduce a lightweight variant of ZeroQAT for quantized fine-tuning, which freezes and pre-quantizes most parameters to further cut memory usage. Experiments show that ZeroQAT consistently outperforms representative PTQ and QAT baselines while requiring significantly less memory. For example, ZeroQAT enables fine-tuning of a 13B model at extremely low bit-widths (e.g., 2-4 bits) on a single 8GB GPU, and even allows fine-tuning a 6.7B model on a OnePlus 12 smartphone, demonstrating its practicality for end-to-end QAT on resource-limited edge devices.

Abstract: Robots often struggle to generalize from a single demonstration due to the lack of a transferable and interpretable spatial representation. In this work, we introduce TReF-6, a method that infers a simplified, abstracted 6DoF Task-Relevant Frame from a single trajectory. Our approach identifies an influence point purely from the trajectory geometry to define the origin for a local frame, which serves as a reference for parameterizing a Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP). This influence point captures the task's spatial structure, extending the standard DMP formulation beyond start-goal imitation. The inferred frame is semantically grounded via a vision-language model and localized in novel scenes by Grounded-SAM, enabling functionally consistent skill generalization. We validate TReF-6 in simulation and demonstrate robustness to trajectory noise. We further deploy an end-to-end pipeline on real-world manipulation tasks, showing that TReF-6 supports one-shot imitation learning that preserves task intent across diverse object configurations.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) have significantly enhanced the ability of these models in multimodal understanding and reasoning. However, the performance of MLLMs for knowledge-intensive visual questions, which require external knowledge beyond the visual content of an image, still remains limited. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution to provide models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and incorporates knowledge synthesis to refine its understanding. At each iteration, the model formulates a reasoning-guided multi-query to explore multiple facets of knowledge. Subsequently, these queries drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases, retrieving diverse knowledge. This retrieved knowledge is then synthesized to enrich the reasoning record, progressively deepening the model's understanding. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Abstract: The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these ``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly, qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity, identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge cases.

<title>GradES: Significantly Faster Training in Transformers with Gradient-Based Early Stopping</title>

Abstract: Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose \textit{GradES}, a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning for both language and vision-language models. \textit{GradES} tracks the magnitude of gradient changes in backpropagation for these matrices during training. When a projection matrix's magnitude of gradient changes fall below a convergence threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow converging matrices to continue learning. \textit{GradES} speeds up training time by 1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2\% higher average accuracy in language tasks and 3.88\% on multimodal benchmarks.

<title>Do LLMs Adhere to Label Definitions? Examining Their Receptivity to External Label Definitions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02452</link>

arXiv:2509.02452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated, LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases. Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions. These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

Abstract: Modern e-commerce platforms strive to enhance customer experience by providing timely and contextually relevant recommendations. However, recommending general merchandise to customers focused on grocery shopping -- such as pairing milk with a milk frother -- remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. This paper introduces a cross-pollination (XP) framework, a novel approach that bridges grocery and general merchandise cross-category recommendations by leveraging multi-source product associations and real-time cart context. Our solution employs a two-stage framework: (1) A candidate generation mechanism that uses co-purchase market basket analysis and LLM-based approach to identify novel item-item associations; and (2) a transformer-based ranker that leverages the real-time sequential cart context and optimizes for engagement signals such as add-to-carts. Offline analysis and online A/B tests show an increase of 36\% add-to-cart rate with LLM-based retrieval on the item page, and 15\% lift in add-to-cart using cart context-based ranker on the cart page. Our work contributes practical techniques for cross-category recommendations and broader insights for e-commerce systems.

<title>Co-Evolving Complexity: An Adversarial Framework for Automatic MARL Curricula</title>

Abstract: The advancement of general-purpose intelligent agents is intrinsically linked to the environments in which they are trained. While scaling models and datasets has yielded remarkable capabilities, scaling the complexity, diversity, and interactivity of environments remains a crucial bottleneck. Hand-crafted environments are finite and often contain implicit biases, limiting the potential for agents to develop truly generalizable and robust skills. In this work, we propose a paradigm for generating a boundless and adaptive curriculum of challenges by framing the environment generation process as an adversarial game. We introduce a system where a team of cooperative multi-agent defenders learns to survive against a procedurally generative attacker. The attacker agent learns to produce increasingly challenging configurations of enemy units, dynamically creating novel worlds tailored to exploit the defenders' current weaknesses. Concurrently, the defender team learns cooperative strategies to overcome these generated threats. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates a self-scaling environment where complexity arises organically from the adversarial interaction, providing an effectively infinite stream of novel and relevant training data. We demonstrate that with minimal training, this approach leads to the emergence of complex, intelligent behaviors, such as flanking and shielding by the attacker, and focus-fire and spreading by the defenders. Our findings suggest that adversarial co-evolution is a powerful mechanism for automatically scaling environmental complexity, driving agents towards greater robustness and strategic depth.

<title>Diffusion Generative Models Meet Compressed Sensing, with Applications to Imaging and Finance</title>

Abstract: In this study we develop dimension-reduction techniques to accelerate diffusion model inference in the context of synthetic data generation. The idea is to integrate compressed sensing into diffusion models (hence, CSDM): First, compress the dataset into a latent space (from an ambient space), and train a diffusion model in the latent space; next, apply a compressed sensing algorithm to the samples generated in the latent space for decoding back to the original space; and the goal is to facilitate the efficiency of both model training and inference. Under certain sparsity assumptions on data, our proposed approach achieves provably faster convergence, via combining diffusion model inference with sparse recovery. It also sheds light on the best choice of the latent space dimension. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we run numerical experiments on a range of datasets, including handwritten digits, medical and climate images, and financial time series for stress testing.

<title>The Physical Basis of Prediction: World Model Formation in Neural Organoids via an LLM-Generated Curriculum</title>

arXiv:2509.04633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capacity of an embodied agent to understand, predict, and interact with its environment is fundamentally contingent on an internal world model. This paper introduces a novel framework for investigating the formation and adaptation of such world models within a biological substrate: human neural organoids. We present a curriculum of three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train these biological agents and probe the underlying synaptic mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments that demand progressively more sophisticated world models for successful decision-making: (1) a conditional avoidance task for learning static state-action contingencies, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario for goal-directed interaction, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game for modeling dynamic, continuous-time systems. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation, which serve to drive model refinement. In a significant methodological advance, we propose a meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model automates the generative design and optimization of experimental protocols, thereby scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal evaluation strategy that moves beyond task performance to directly measure the physical correlates of the learned world model by quantifying synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between model-based reinforcement learning and computational neuroscience, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, decision-making, and the physical basis of intelligence.

<title>BranchGRPO: Stable and Efficient GRPO with Structured Branching in Diffusion Models</title>

arXiv:2509.06040v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in aligning image and video generative models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has improved human preference alignment, but existing variants remain inefficient due to sequential rollouts and large numbers of sampling steps, unreliable credit assignment: sparse terminal rewards are uniformly propagated across timesteps, failing to capture the varying criticality of decisions during denoising. In this paper, we present BranchGRPO, a method that restructures the rollout process into a branching tree, where shared prefixes amortize computation and pruning removes low-value paths and redundant depths. BranchGRPO introduces three contributions: (1) a branching scheme that amortizes rollout cost through shared prefixes while preserving exploration diversity; (2) a reward fusion and depth-wise advantage estimator that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense step-level signals; and (3) pruning strategies that cut gradient computation but leave forward rollouts and exploration unaffected. On HPDv2.1 image alignment, BranchGRPO improves alignment scores by up to \textbf{16\%} over DanceGRPO, while reducing per-iteration training time by nearly \textbf{55\%}. A hybrid variant, BranchGRPO-Mix, further accelerates training to 4.7x faster than DanceGRPO without degrading alignment. On WanX video generation, it further achieves higher Video-Align scores with sharper and temporally consistent frames compared to DanceGRPO. Codes are available at \href{https://fredreic1849.github.io/BranchGRPO-Webpage/}{BranchGRPO}.

<title>COMPACT: Common-token Optimized Model Pruning Across Channels and Tokens</title>

arXiv:2509.06836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Making large language models (LLMs) more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at scale. Pruning is a promising technique, but existing pruning methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout, requiring custom inference code, while depth pruning can cause abrupt accuracy drops. Also, while many pruning approaches are effective against LLMs, they struggle to maintain performance on small language models (SLMs). In this work, we propose COMPACT, which jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/LM head layers and (ii) prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations, aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT inherits strengths of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab. vs. FFN pruning), competitive pruning times, and strong memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream performance, with substantial reductions in parameters, GPU memory, and latency.

<title>DEPFusion: Dual-Domain Enhancement and Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion for UAV Multispectral Object Detection</title>

arXiv:2509.07327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multispectral object detection is an important application for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, it faces several challenges. First, low-light RGB images weaken the multispectral fusion due to details loss. Second, the interference information is introduced to local target modeling during multispectral fusion. Third, computational cost poses deployment challenge on UAV platforms, such as transformer-based methods with quadratic complexity. To address these issues, a framework named DEPFusion consisting of two designed modules, Dual-Domain Enhancement (DDE) and Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion (PGMF) , is proposed for UAV multispectral object detection. Firstly, considering the adoption of low-frequency component for global brightness enhancement and frequency spectra features for texture-details recovery, DDE module is designed with Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba (CSWM) block and Fourier Details Recovery (FDR) block. Secondly, considering guiding the scanning of Mamba from high priority score tokens, which contain local target feature, a novel Priority-Guided Serialization is proposed with theoretical proof. Based on it, PGMF module is designed for multispectral feature fusion, which enhance local modeling and reduce interference information. Experiments on DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets demonstrate that DEPFusion achieves good performance with state-of-the-art methods.

arXiv:2509.08269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong understanding and reasoning capabilities, are increasingly being explored for tackling optimization problems, especially in synergy with evolutionary computation. Despite rapid progress, however, the field still lacks a unified synthesis and a systematic taxonomy. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of recent developments and organizing them within a structured framework. We classify existing research into two main stages: LLMs for optimization modeling and LLMs for optimization solving. The latter is further divided into three paradigms according to the role of LLMs in the optimization workflow: LLMs as stand-alone optimizers, low-level LLMs embedded within optimization algorithms, and high-level LLMs for algorithm selection and generation. For each category, we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine their interplay with traditional approaches. We also review interdisciplinary applications spanning the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning. By contrasting LLM-driven and conventional methods, we highlight key limitations and research gaps, and point toward future directions for developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems for optimization. An up-to-date collection of related literature is maintained at https://github.com/ishmael233/LLM4OPT.

<title>Graph Alignment via Dual-Pass Spectral Encoding and Latent Space Communication</title>

Abstract: Graph alignment, the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across multiple graphs, is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios. Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language representations.

Abstract: We present TalkPlayData 2, a synthetic dataset for multimodal conversational music recommendation generated by an agentic data pipeline. In the proposed pipeline, multiple large language model (LLM) agents are created under various roles with specialized prompts and access to different parts of information, and the chat data is acquired by logging the conversation between the Listener LLM and the Recsys LLM. To cover various conversation scenarios, for each conversation, the Listener LLM is conditioned on a finetuned conversation goal. Finally, all the LLMs are multimodal with audio and images, allowing a simulation of multimodal recommendation and conversation. In the LLM-as-a-judge and subjective evaluation experiments, TalkPlayData 2 achieved the proposed goal in various aspects related to training a generative recommendation model for music. TalkPlayData 2 and its generation code are open-sourced at https://talkpl.ai/talkplaydata2.html.

Abstract: Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech language modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision, supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and (iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS, demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis. Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech tokenization and downstream tasks. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/mubtasimahasan/FuseCodec.

Abstract: We propose MindVL, a multimodal large language model (MLLMs) trained on Ascend NPUs. The training of state-of-the-art MLLMs is often confined to a limited set of hardware platforms and relies heavily on massive, undisclosed data recipes, which hinders reproducibility and open research. To change the common perception that Ascend hardware is unsuitable for efficient full-stage MLLM training, we introduce MindSpeed-MLLM, a highly efficient training framework that supports stable and high-performance training of large-scale Dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on Ascend hardware. Based on this, we provide a systematic and open description of the data production methods and mixing strategies for all training stages. Furthermore, we present MindVL, a data-efficient multimodal large language model trained end-to-end on Ascend NPUs. In addition, we find that averaging weights from checkpoints trained with different sequence lengths is particularly effective and yields further gains when combined with test-time resolution search. Our experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency: MindVL-8B matches the performance of Qwen2.5VL-7B using only 10\% of its training data, while our MoE model, MindVL-671B-A37B, matches Qwen2.5VL-72B using only 3\% of the Qwen2.5VL training data, and achieves comparable performance with other leading multimodal MoE models. Our work provides the community with a valuable hardware alternative, open data recipes, and effective performance-enhancing techniques.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for adaptive routing in multitask, multimodal prediction settings where data heterogeneity and task interactions vary across samples. Motivated by applications in psychotherapy where structured assessments and unstructured clinician notes coexist with partially missing data and correlated outcomes, we introduce a routing-based architecture that dynamically selects modality processing pathways and task-sharing strategies on a per-sample basis. Our model defines multiple modality paths, including raw and fused representations of text and numeric features and learns to route each input through the most informative expert combination. Task-specific predictions are produced by shared or independent heads depending on the routing decision, and the entire system is trained end-to-end. We evaluate the model on both synthetic data and real-world psychotherapy notes predicting depression and anxiety outcomes. Our experiments show that our method consistently outperforms fixed multitask or single-task baselines, and that the learned routing policy provides interpretable insights into modality relevance and task structure. This addresses critical challenges in personalized healthcare by enabling per-subject adaptive information processing that accounts for data heterogeneity and task correlations. Applied to psychotherapy, this framework could improve mental health outcomes, enhance treatment assignment precision, and increase clinical cost-effectiveness through personalized intervention strategies.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT are transforming the educational landscape, prompting reconsideration of traditional assessment practices. In parallel, universities are exploring alternatives to in-person, closed-book examinations, raising concerns about academic integrity and pedagogical alignment in uninvigilated settings. This study investigates whether traditional closed-book mathematics examinations retain their pedagogical relevance when hypothetically administered in uninvigilated, open-book settings with GenAI access. Adopting an empirical approach, we generate, transcribe, and blind-mark GenAI submissions to eight undergraduate mathematics examinations at a Russell Group university, spanning the entirety of the first-year curriculum. By combining independent GenAI responses to individual questions, we enable a meaningful evaluation of GenAI performance, both at the level of modules and across the first-year curriculum. We find that GenAI attainment is at the level of a first-class degree, though current performance can vary between modules. Further, we find that GenAI performance is remarkably consistent when viewed across the entire curriculum, significantly more so than that of students in invigilated examinations. Our findings evidence the need for redesigning assessments in mathematics for unsupervised settings, and highlight the potential reduction in pedagogical value of current standards in the era of generative artificial intelligence.

Abstract: We present TreeIRL, a novel planner for autonomous driving that combines Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to achieve state-of-the-art performance in simulation and in real-world driving. The core idea is to use MCTS to find a promising set of safe candidate trajectories and a deep IRL scoring function to select the most human-like among them. We evaluate TreeIRL against both classical and state-of-the-art planners in large-scale simulations and on 500+ miles of real-world autonomous driving in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Test scenarios include dense urban traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights. TreeIRL achieves the best overall performance, striking a balance between safety, progress, comfort, and human-likeness. To our knowledge, our work is the first demonstration of MCTS-based planning on public roads and underscores the importance of evaluating planners across a diverse set of metrics and in real-world environments. TreeIRL is highly extensible and could be further improved with reinforcement learning and imitation learning, providing a framework for exploring different combinations of classical and learning-based approaches to solve the planning bottleneck in autonomous driving.

<title>WorldForge: Unlocking Emergent 3D/4D Generation in Video Diffusion Model via Training-Free Guidance</title>

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models show immense potential for spatial intelligence tasks due to their rich world priors, but this is undermined by limited controllability, poor spatial-temporal consistency, and entangled scene-camera dynamics. Existing solutions, such as model fine-tuning and warping-based repainting, struggle with scalability, generalization, and robustness against artifacts. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free, inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. 1) Intra-Step Recursive Refinement injects fine-grained trajectory guidance at denoising steps through a recursive correction loop, ensuring motion remains aligned with the target path. 2) Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels. 3) Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and photorealistic content generation. Our framework is plug-and-play and model-agnostic, enabling broad applicability across various 3D/4D tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in trajectory adherence, geometric consistency, and perceptual quality, outperforming both training-intensive and inference-only baselines.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) language models generate text one token at a time, which limits their inference speed. Diffusion-based language models offer a promising alternative, as they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, we identify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window problem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become irrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address this issue by splitting windows into blocks, but this sacrifices speed and bidirectionality, eliminating the main advantage of diffusion models. To overcome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based method that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to better fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based Fine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at positions far from context. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on open-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval) among diffusion LM baselines, with significantly lower step size than previous works, demonstrating both speed and quality improvements.

Abstract: Auto-bidding serves as a critical tool for advertisers to improve their advertising performance. Recent progress has demonstrated that AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB), which learns a conditional generative planner from offline data, achieves superior performance compared to typical offline reinforcement learning (RL)-based auto-bidding methods. However, existing AIGB methods still face a performance bottleneck due to their inherent inability to explore beyond the static offline dataset. To address this, we propose {AIGB-Pearl} (\emph{{P}lanning with {E}valu{A}tor via RL}), a novel method that integrates generative planning and policy optimization. The core of AIGB-Pearl lies in constructing a trajectory evaluator for scoring generation quality and designing a provably sound KL-Lipschitz-constrained score maximization scheme to ensure safe and efficient generalization beyond the offline dataset. A practical algorithm incorporating the synchronous coupling technique is further devised to ensure the model regularity required by the proposed scheme. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world advertising systems demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.

Abstract: Open digital public infrastructure needs community management to ensure accountability, sustainability, and robustness. Yet open-source projects often rely on centralized decision-making, and the determinants of successful community management remain unclear. We analyze 637 GitHub repositories to trace transitions from founder-led to shared governance. Specifically, we document trajectories to community governance by extracting institutional roles, actions, and deontic cues from version-controlled project constitutions (GOVERNANCE.md). With a semantic parsing pipeline, we cluster elements into broader role and action types. We find roles and actions grow, and regulation becomes more balanced, reflecting increases in governance scope and differentiation over time. Rather than shifting tone, communities grow by layering and refining responsibilities. As transitions to community management mature, projects increasingly regulate ecosystem-level relationships and add definition to project oversight roles. Overall, this work offers a scalable pipeline for tracking the growth and development of community governance regimes from open-source software's familiar default of founder-ownership.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenges associated with merging low-rank adaptations of large neural networks. With the rise of parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), model fine-tuning has become more accessible. While fine-tuning models with LoRA is highly efficient, existing merging methods often sacrifice this efficiency by merging fully-sized weight matrices. We propose the Core Space merging framework, which enables the merging of LoRA-adapted models within a common alignment basis, thereby preserving the efficiency of low-rank adaptation while substantially improving accuracy across tasks. We further provide a formal proof that projection into Core Space ensures no loss of information and provide a complexity analysis showing the efficiency gains. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that Core Space significantly improves existing merging techniques and achieves state-of-the-art results on both vision and language tasks while utilizing a fraction of the computational resources.

<title>StefaLand: An Efficient Geoscience Foundation Model That Improves Dynamic Land-Surface Predictions</title>

Abstract: Stewarding natural resources, mitigating floods, droughts, wildfires, and landslides, and meeting growing demands require models that can predict climate-driven land-surface responses and human feedback with high accuracy. Traditional impact models, whether process-based, statistical, or machine learning, struggle with spatial generalization due to limited observations and concept drift. Recently proposed vision foundation models trained on satellite imagery demand massive compute and are ill-suited for dynamic land-surface prediction. We introduce StefaLand, a generative spatiotemporal earth foundation model centered on landscape interactions. StefaLand improves predictions on four tasks and five datasets: streamflow, soil moisture, and soil composition, compared to prior state-of-the-art. Results highlight its ability to generalize across diverse, data-scarce regions and support broad land-surface applications. The model builds on a masked autoencoder backbone that learns deep joint representations of landscape attributes, with a location-aware architecture fusing static and time-series inputs, attribute-based representations that drastically reduce compute, and residual fine-tuning adapters that enhance transfer. While inspired by prior methods, their alignment with geoscience and integration in one model enables robust performance on dynamic land-surface tasks. StefaLand can be pretrained and finetuned on academic compute yet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and even fine-tuned vision foundation models. To our knowledge, this is the first geoscience land-surface foundation model that demonstrably improves dynamic land-surface interaction predictions and supports diverse downstream applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in diverse applications, but the problems of high latency and energy overhead are inevitable on resource-constrained devices. To address this challenge, most researchers focus on the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique to balance the latency and energy consumption by changing the computing frequency of processors. However, the adjustment of memory frequency is usually ignored and not fully utilized to achieve efficient DNN inference, which also plays a significant role in the inference time and energy consumption. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of joint memory frequency and computing frequency scaling on the inference time and energy consumption with a model-based and data-driven method. Then by combining with the fitting parameters of different DNN models, we give a preliminary analysis for the proposed model to see the effects of adjusting memory frequency and computing frequency simultaneously. Finally, simulation results in local inference and cooperative inference cases further validate the effectiveness of jointly scaling the memory frequency and computing frequency to reduce the energy consumption of devices.

Abstract: We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial structures that improve on known limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically, we use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:
  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using AlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper bounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error in the third decimal place.
  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new inapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of improving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget reduction from "standard" H{\aa}stad-style PCPs.
  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both settings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$). We conclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI in developing proofs.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) applications are built from specialized components -- inference servers, object storage, vector and graph databases, and user interfaces -- interconnected via web-based APIs. While these components are often containerized and deployed in cloud environments, such capabilities are still emerging at High-Performance Computing (HPC) centers. In this paper, we share our experience deploying GenAI workloads within an established HPC center, discussing the integration of HPC and cloud computing environments. We describe our converged computing architecture that integrates HPC and Kubernetes platforms running containerized GenAI workloads, helping with reproducibility. A case study illustrates the deployment of the Llama Large Language Model (LLM) using a containerized inference server (vLLM) across both Kubernetes and HPC platforms using multiple container runtimes. Our experience highlights practical considerations and opportunities for the HPC container community, guiding future research and tool development.

Abstract: We experiment with a low-latency, end-to-end voice-to-voice communication model to optimize it for real-time conversational applications. By analyzing components essential to voice to voice (V-2-V) system viz. automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and dialog management, our work analyzes how to reduce processing time while maintaining high-quality interactions to identify the levers for optimizing V-2-V system. Our work identifies that TTS component which generates life-like voice, full of emotions including natural pauses and exclamations has highest impact on Real time factor (RTF). The experimented V-2-V architecture utilizes CSM1b has the capability to understand tone as well as context of conversation by ingesting both audio and text of prior exchanges to generate contextually accurate speech. We explored optimization of Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) iterations by the TTS decoder which come at a cost of decrease in the quality of voice generated. Our experimental evaluations also demonstrate that for V-2-V implementations based on CSM most important optimizations can be brought by reducing the number of RVQ Iterations along with the codebooks used in Mimi.

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

<title>Can Less Precise Be More Reliable? A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy</title>

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

<title>Towards Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Synthetic Data and Relative Context Discrepancy</title>

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture, enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD} significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection.

Summary:
This paper introduces a dynamic reinforcement learning framework to enhance tree-structured reasoning methods, specifically focusing on the Probabilistic Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree) framework. The traditional static implementation of ProbTree is improved upon by allowing for dynamic adaptation of the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates. By learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or aggregation), the framework maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while increasing solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion and focused resource allocation. This advancement represents a new paradigm for tree-structured reasoning, striking a balance between the reliability of probabilistic frameworks and the flexibility needed for practical question answering systems. <div>

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al., 2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration. Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge (Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and (2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering systems.

Abstract: Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM, Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.

The STAR-XAI Protocol introduces a structured methodology for training and operating reliable AI agents through a Socratic dialogue approach. It utilizes a symbolic rulebook and integrity protocols, including a state-locking Checksum, to ensure transparency and reliability in AI decision-making processes. A case study in the game "Caps i Caps" demonstrates the transformation of an opaque LRM into a disciplined strategist capable of long-term planning and clear justification of intentions. The agent showcases Second-Order Agency by identifying and correcting flaws in its own plans, leading to 100% reliable state tracking and the prevention of hallucinations.

Abstract: The "black box" nature of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) presents critical limitations in reliability and transparency, fueling the debate around the "illusion of thinking" and the challenge of state hallucinations in agentic systems. In response, we introduce The STAR-XAI Protocol (Socratic, Transparent, Agentic, Reasoning - for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence), a novel operational methodology for training and operating verifiably reliable AI agents. Our method reframes the human-AI interaction as a structured Socratic dialogue governed by an explicit, evolving symbolic rulebook (the Consciousness Transfer Package - CTP) and a suite of integrity protocols, including a state-locking Checksum that eradicates internal state corruption. Through an exhaustive case study in the complex strategic game "Caps i Caps," we demonstrate that this "Clear Box" framework transforms an opaque LRM into a disciplined strategist. The agent not only exhibits the emergence of complex tactics, such as long-term planning, but also achieves ante-hoc transparency by justifying its intentions before acting. Crucially, it demonstrates Second-Order Agency by identifying and correcting flaws in its own supervisor-approved plans, leading to empirically-proven, 100% reliable state tracking and achieving "zero hallucinations by design." The STAR-XAI Protocol thus offers a practical pathway toward building AI agents that are not just high-performing but intrinsically auditable, trustworthy, and reliable.

Abstract: Technology-enhanced learning environments often help students retrieve relevant learning content for questions arising during self-paced study. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as novel aids for information retrieval during learning. While LLMs are effective for general-purpose question-answering, they typically lack alignment with the domain knowledge of specific course materials such as textbooks and slides. We investigate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, a knowledge graph-enhanced RAG approach, for page-level question answering in an undergraduate mathematics textbook. While RAG has been effective for retrieving discrete, contextually relevant passages, GraphRAG may excel in modeling interconnected concepts and hierarchical knowledge structures. We curate a dataset of 477 question-answer pairs, each tied to a distinct textbook page. We then compare the standard embedding-based RAG methods to GraphRAG for evaluating both retrieval accuracy-whether the correct page is retrieved-and generated answer quality via F1 scores. Our findings show that embedding-based RAG achieves higher retrieval accuracy and better F1 scores compared to GraphRAG, which tends to retrieve excessive and sometimes irrelevant content due to its entity-based structure. We also explored re-ranking the retrieved pages with LLM and observed mixed results, including performance drop and hallucinations when dealing with larger context windows. Overall, this study highlights both the promises and challenges of page-level retrieval systems in educational contexts, emphasizing the need for more refined retrieval methods to build reliable AI tutoring solutions in providing reference page numbers.

Summary: The article discusses the need for effective long sequence modeling due to the increasing sequence lengths. It introduces the Dendritic Resonate-and-Fire (D-RF) model, which incorporates a multi-dendritic and soma architecture to address the limitations of RF neurons in memory capacity and training speed.

Abstract: The explosive growth in sequence length has intensified the demand for effective and efficient long sequence modeling. Benefiting from intrinsic oscillatory membrane dynamics, Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neurons can efficiently extract frequency components from input signals and encode them into spatiotemporal spike trains, making them well-suited for long sequence modeling. However, RF neurons exhibit limited effective memory capacity and a trade-off between energy efficiency and training speed on complex temporal tasks. Inspired by the dendritic structure of biological neurons, we propose a Dendritic Resonate-and-Fire (D-RF) model, which explicitly incorporates a multi-dendritic and soma architecture. Each dendritic branch encodes specific frequency bands by utilizing the intrinsic oscillatory dynamics of RF neurons, thereby collectively achieving comprehensive frequency representation. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive threshold mechanism into the soma structure that adjusts the threshold based on historical spiking activity, reducing redundant spikes while maintaining training efficiency in long sequence tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains competitive accuracy while substantially ensuring sparse spikes without compromising computational efficiency during training. These results underscore its potential as an effective and efficient solution for long sequence modeling on edge platforms.

<div> facility enumeration, compliance checking, large language models, automated validation, door detection

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new task for compliance checking called automated facility enumeration, which involves validating the quantity of different facility types according to regulations. The method proposed integrates door detection with large language models (LLMs) for reasoning, using a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) pipeline to enhance performance. This is the first application of LLMs to this task, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse datasets and facility types. Experiments on real-world and synthetic floor plan data show the method's robustness and generalizability. By automating facility enumeration, the approach streamlines compliance checking processes, reducing the time and labor required for manual validation. <div>

Abstract: Building compliance checking (BCC) is a critical process for ensuring that constructed facilities meet regulatory standards. A core component of BCC is the accurate enumeration of facility types and their spatial distribution. Despite its importance, this problem has been largely overlooked in the literature, posing a significant challenge for BCC and leaving a critical gap in existing workflows. Performing this task manually is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to enhance automation by combining visual recognition with reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a new task for BCC: automated facility enumeration, which involves validating the quantity of each facility type against statutory requirements. To address it, we propose a novel method that integrates door detection with LLM-based reasoning. We are the first to apply LLMs to this task and further enhance their performance through a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) pipeline. Our approach generalizes well across diverse datasets and facility types. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic floor plan data demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.

<div> monitoring, language models, deception detection, content filtering, score filtering

Summary:
Content filtering, score filtering, and prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms were proposed as novel evaluation strategies for white box monitors analyzing large language models. The study focused on detecting genuine model behavior rather than elicitation artifacts. The evaluation revealed that content filtering effectively removed elicitation signals, reducing probe AUROC by 30%. Score filtering, although useful in reducing AUROC by 15%, was challenging to attribute directly. Additionally, utilizing prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms improved monitor evaluations but decreased performance by up to 40% even after re-training. The study identified two forms of leakage inflating monitor performance: elicitation leakage from explicit prompts for harmful behavior and reasoning leakage from models verbalizing their deceptive actions. These findings highlight the importance of developing effective mitigation strategies and measuring the performance retention of monitors in detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However, training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

<div> Keywords: Chain-of-thought reasoning, large language models, decision pivots, self-training pipeline, verifiable checkpoints 

Summary:
The article introduces the concept of decision pivots as minimal, verifiable checkpoints in the reasoning process of large language models (LLMs). It suggests that correct reasoning paths converge on the same pivot set, while incorrect paths deviate from at least one pivot. A self-training pipeline is proposed to sample diverse reasoning paths, mine shared decision pivots, compress traces into pivot-focused short-path reasoning, and post-train the model using self-generated outputs. This method aligns reasoning without relying on ground truth data or external metrics. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving reasoning ability in LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exposes the intermediate thinking process of large language models (LLMs), yet verifying those traces at scale remains unsolved. In response, we introduce the idea of decision pivots-minimal, verifiable checkpoints that any correct reasoning path must visit. We hypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on the same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot. Leveraging this property, we propose a self-training pipeline that (i) samples diverse reasoning paths and mines shared decision pivots, (ii) compresses each trace into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier, and (iii) post-trains the model using its self-generated outputs. The proposed method aligns reasoning without ground truth reasoning data or external metrics. Experiments on standard benchmarks such as LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 show the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph (KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible, extensible framework for human--AI collaboration in scientific research.

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

Summary:  
GeoEvolve is introduced as a multi-agent large language model framework that combines evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. It operates using nested loops, with a code evolver generating candidate solutions and an agentic controller evaluating them. The framework incorporates a geospatial knowledge base called GeoKnowRAG, injecting theoretical priors from geography into the evolution process. GeoEvolve is evaluated on spatial interpolation and uncertainty quantification tasks, demonstrating improved algorithm performance and discovery of new approaches with the integration of geospatial theory. Ablation studies highlight the importance of domain-guided retrieval for successful evolution. The results show GeoEvolve as a promising tool for automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling in AI-for-Science discovery.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks: spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification (geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error (RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%. Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable, high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.

Summary:
The article introduces a multimodal AI framework, MultiFIX, designed for accurate and interpretable survival analysis in oncology. It integrates clinical variables and computed tomography imaging data to automate the process. The framework utilizes deep learning to infer survival-relevant features, which are explained through imaging features using Grad-CAM and clinical variables through genetic programming. Risk estimation is performed using a transparent Cox regression, allowing for the stratification of patients into distinct survival outcome groups. In testing on the RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a C-index of 0.838 for prediction and 0.826 for stratification, outperforming baseline approaches. The results demonstrate the potential of interpretable multimodal AI in precision oncology, providing clinicians with a transparent and reliable tool for prognosis and treatment decision-making.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity. We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM, while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for precision oncology with MultiFIX.

<div> Keywords: Semantic F1 Scores, multi-label classification, label similarity matrix, fuzzy category boundaries, interpretability

Summary: 
Semantic F1 Scores are proposed as evaluation metrics for subjective or fuzzy multi-label classification tasks. These novel metrics quantify the semantic relatedness between predicted and gold labels by incorporating a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like scores. Unlike conventional F1 metrics, Semantic F1 provides partial credit for semantically related but nonidentical labels, reflecting the nuances of domains with human disagreement or fuzzy category boundaries. The two-step precision-recall formulation allows for the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. Empirical validation on synthetic and real data demonstrates the interpretability and ecological validity of Semantic F1, showing its applicability across tasks and modalities. By recognizing category overlap and annotator disagreement, Semantic F1 offers fairer evaluations and better reflects the complexities of real-world classification scenarios. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We propose Semantic F1 Scores, novel evaluation metrics for subjective or fuzzy multi-label classification that quantify semantic relatedness between predicted and gold labels. Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix, which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable across tasks and modalities.

Summary:
The paper introduces a scalable approach to continuous physical safety benchmarking for Embodied AI systems, using real-world injury narratives and safety constraints. It analyzes how foundation models perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger interventions, providing insights into their deployment readiness for safety-critical applications. Additionally, the paper develops a post-training paradigm to teach models to reason about embodiment-specific safety constraints, achieving state-of-the-art performance in constraint satisfaction evaluations. The approach involves creating photorealistic images and videos to capture transitions from safe to unsafe states, allowing for a better understanding of physical safety. The benchmark will be accessible for further research and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent -- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions. The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at https://asimov-benchmark.github.io/v2

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts. We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens. Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages, substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

<div> Keywords: Large reasoning models, Retrieval-of-Thought, efficiency gains, dynamic template construction, scalability

Summary:
Large reasoning models often produce long reasoning traces, leading to increased latency and cost during inference. To address this issue, a new approach called Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT) is proposed. RoT leverages prior reasoning as reusable "thought" steps to guide new problems. By organizing these steps into a thought graph with sequential and semantic edges, RoT enables fast retrieval and flexible recombination. During inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and uses reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template for generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration, resulting in a decrease in output tokens while maintaining accuracy. Evaluation on reasoning benchmarks demonstrates that RoT can reduce output tokens by up to 40%, inference latency by 82%, and cost by 59%. RoT presents a scalable paradigm for efficient reasoning in Large reasoning models through dynamic template construction via retrieval.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces, but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable ``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and, therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage, latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction through retrieval.

<div> neural VRP solvers, lifelong learning, behavior consolidation, catastrophic forgetting, zero-shot generalization
Summary:
The paper introduces a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural solvers in solving routing problems. Existing solvers are typically trained on predefined tasks, leading to poor generalization when faced with new tasks. The proposed Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) framework addresses this issue by consolidating prior knowledge and aligning solver behaviors with past experiences. LLR-BC also focuses on crucial experiences by assigning greater weights to decisions with lower confidence. Through extensive experiments on routing problems, LLR-BC demonstrates effectiveness in training high-performance solvers in a lifelong learning setting. It successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting, maintains solver plasticity, and improves zero-shot generalization ability. <div>
arXiv:2509.21765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed. LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way. To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue, maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

<div> Benchmark, Autonomous agents, Long-horizon tasks, Partially observable, Exploration <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a new benchmark called UltraHorizon to evaluate autonomous agents in long-horizon and partially observable tasks, essential for real-world challenges. This benchmark tests agents' abilities in sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Through exploration tasks in three environments, agents must uncover hidden rules through iterative interaction with the environment. Results show that LLM-agents struggle in these settings, while human participants excel, highlighting a gap in agents' long-horizon capabilities. Simple scaling methods prove ineffective in improving agent performance. An in-depth analysis of trajectories uncovers eight types of errors caused by in-context locking and functional capability gaps. The research aims to address the shortcomings in existing benchmarks and promote the development of agents capable of handling long-horizon, partially observable tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.21766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks. In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings, whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth analysis of collected trajectories.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal large language models, Web understanding benchmark, Reasoning, Robustness, Safety

Summary: <br /><br /> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used in web-related applications, but existing benchmarks lack evaluation in areas required for end-to-end web applications. To address this gap, the authors introduce the WebRSSBench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and Safety across various web-related tasks. The benchmark consists of 729 websites and 3799 question-answer pairs, testing multi-step inference over page elements, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions. Results from evaluating 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench highlight significant gaps in compositional reasoning, limited robustness against interface perturbations, and conservatism in safety-critical actions recognition. The benchmark is designed with standardized prompts, deterministic evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control to ensure reliable measurement. The authors provide their code for the benchmark on GitHub for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions. To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions. Our code is available at https://github.com/jinliang-byte/webssrbench.

<div> framework, GUI tasks, D-Artemis, TAC Check, MLLMs <br />
<br />
Summary: <br /> 
The paper introduces D-Artemis, a novel deliberative framework for Graphical User Interface (GUI) tasks that overcomes challenges faced by current approaches. D-Artemis follows a cognitive loop of Thinking, Alignment, and Reflection and leverages a tip retrieval mechanism for decision-making. It includes a Pre-execution Alignment stage with a TAC Check module and ACA to prevent execution failures. The post-execution SRA enables learning from experience. D-Artemis improves MLLMs for GUI tasks without complex training datasets and achieves SOTA results on benchmarks, with a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2. Ablation studies highlight the significance of each component in the framework. <div>

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking, Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC) Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA) completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience. Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks, achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of each component to the framework.

<div> reward, large language models, GUI agents, ProRe, proactive reward system

Summary:
The article introduces ProRe, a proactive reward system designed to improve the evaluation and training of large language models (LLMs) in GUI agents. Current reward methods for LLMs face challenges in generalizing to GUI agents without access to ground-truth trajectories or application databases. ProRe utilizes a general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents to schedule targeted state probing tasks, allowing for active interaction with the environment to collect additional observations and assign more accurate rewards. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories show that ProRe enhances reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%, respectively. Integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy agents leads to a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%. <div>

Abstract: Reward is critical to the evaluation and training of large language models (LLMs). However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to generalize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or application databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The reasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents then execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional observations. This enables the reasoner to assign more accurate and verifiable rewards to GUI agents. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories demonstrate that ProRe improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%, respectively. Furthermore, integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy agents yields a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.

<div> Keywords: Data science, large language models, data analysis, verification, complex analyses

Summary: 
DS-STAR is a novel data science agent designed to automate complex data analysis tasks. It incorporates a data file analysis module that can handle diverse data formats, including unstructured types. Additionally, DS-STAR uses an LLM-based judge to verify the sufficiency of the analysis plan at each stage. It employs a sequential planning mechanism that iteratively refines the analysis plan based on feedback until verification is achieved. Experiment results demonstrate that DS-STAR outperforms baselines on challenging benchmarks, especially excelling in tasks requiring processing multiple data files with varying formats. By combining automated data exploration, verification, and iterative planning, DS-STAR provides a reliable solution for navigating complex analyses involving diverse data sources. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data science, which transforms raw data into actionable insights, is critical for data-driven decision-making. However, these tasks are often complex, involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR, a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.

Summary:
The article introduces a framework for modeling decisions using axioms that involve ethical constraints. It defines a taxonomy of decision axioms based on their structural properties. A tension, termed the Decision-Evaluation Paradox, is identified between using axioms for decision-making and evaluating decisions. The paradox arises due to realistic axiom structures, emphasizing the need for caution when training models on decision data or applying axioms in decision processes. The framework sheds light on the complexities of incorporating ethical constraints in decision-making and evaluation processes, highlighting the importance of careful consideration and awareness of potential paradoxes in decision modeling. The taxonomy provided offers a structured approach to understanding decision axioms and their implications, guiding researchers and practitioners in navigating ethical dilemmas within decision frameworks. <div>

Abstract: We introduce a framework for modeling decisions with axioms that are statements about decisions, e.g., ethical constraints. Using our framework we define a taxonomy of decision axioms based on their structural properties and demonstrate a tension between the use of axioms to make decisions and the use of axioms to evaluate decisions which we call the Decision-Evaluation Paradox. We argue that the Decision-Evaluation Paradox arises with realistic axiom structures, and the paradox illuminates why one must be exceptionally careful when training models on decision data or applying axioms to make and evaluate decisions.

<div> Keywords: Travel planning agent, Reinforcement learning, Autonomous planning, Sandbox environment, Hierarchical reward modeling<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces DeepTravel, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework for creating autonomous travel planning agents. The framework allows the agent to plan, execute tools, and learn from tool responses for multi-step reasoning. A robust sandbox environment is constructed to train the agent without real-world API limitations. A hierarchical reward modeling system validates travel itineraries and ensures consistency with tool responses. The proposed reply augmented reinforcement learning method allows the agent to learn from past failures. Trained with DeepTravel, small size language models outperform existing frontier models in travel planning tasks. The DeepTravel agent is deployed on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and undergoes comprehensive evaluations, showcasing its effectiveness in generating enjoyable travel itineraries. <div>
arXiv:2509.21842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Travel planning (TP) agent has recently worked as an emerging building block to interact with external tools and resources for travel itinerary generation, ensuring enjoyable user experience. Despite its benefits, existing studies rely on hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and autonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic reinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent, capable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool responses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step reasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g., inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses, enabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply augmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically replay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We deploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct comprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel enables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing frontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks.

Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S. tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and scientifically grounded research.

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a new paradigm called TRACE for learning to compute on computational graphs. The current dominant paradigm, including MPNNs and conventional Transformer-based models, lacks the ability to capture the hierarchical and position-aware nature of computation. TRACE addresses this by utilizing a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the flow of computation and introducing function shift learning as a novel objective. This objective focuses on predicting the function shift, the difference between the true global function and a simple local approximation based on input independence. The model is tested on electronic circuits, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing architectures. The architecturally-aligned backbone and decoupled learning objective of TRACE prove to be a more robust approach for learning to compute on graphs. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.21886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a computational graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts, prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of computation. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective. First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce \textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model is trained to predict only the \textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs. Across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.

Dynamic job shop scheduling is a challenging problem due to frequent disruptions caused by new job arrivals. State-of-the-art methods combine machine learning and offline policies with planning techniques such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve online decision-making. The proposed Dynamic Robust MCTS (DyRo-MCTS) approach integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS to guide scheduling decisions towards states that are not only optimal but also adaptable to future disturbances.

Abstract: Dynamic job shop scheduling, a fundamental combinatorial optimisation problem in various industrial sectors, poses substantial challenges for effective scheduling due to frequent disruptions caused by the arrival of new jobs. State-of-the-art methods employ machine learning to learn scheduling policies offline, enabling rapid responses to dynamic events. However, these offline policies are often imperfect, necessitating the use of planning techniques such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance at online decision time. The unpredictability of new job arrivals complicates online planning, as decisions based on incomplete problem information are vulnerable to disturbances. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS (DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS. DyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield good scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals. Extensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online planning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across various scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make robust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains under disturbances.

Plantar pressure mapping is crucial in clinical and sports science, but datasets often contain outliers. This study compared Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) and explainable machine learning (ML) for outlier detection in plantar pressure data. The ML approach, utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) explained by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), outperformed SPM in accuracy, identifying true outliers and clinically meaningful variations. Experts found both SPM and SHAP explanations clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was perceived as less complex.

arXiv:2509.21943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform decision-making.

<div> Keywords: multi-agent collaboration, large language models, intent inference, belief modeling, communication efficiency

Summary:
CoBel-World introduces a novel framework for enhancing collaborative task solving among large language model (LLM) agents. The framework focuses on equipping LLM agents with a collaborative belief world, allowing them to reason about both the physical environment and their collaborators' mental states. By parsing task knowledge into structured beliefs using a symbolic belief language and performing Bayesian-style belief updates through LLM reasoning, agents can proactively detect potential miscoordination and communicate adaptively. The evaluation on challenging benchmarks shows that CoBel-World reduces communication costs significantly and improves task completion efficiency compared to existing methods. This approach highlights the importance of explicit, intent-aware belief modeling in LLM-based multi-agent systems for achieving efficient and human-like collaboration. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

- The framework RISK addresses the challenge of managing e-commerce risk through multi-step, stateful interactions.
- RISK integrates components such as RISK-Data, RISK-Bench, and RISK-R1 to build and deploy GUI agents for web data aggregation.
- The RISK-R1 reinforcement fine-tuning framework improves output format, single-step accuracy, process reweighting, and task difficulty focus.
- Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms existing baselines with improvements in offline and online evaluations.
- RISK advances the state of the art in e-commerce risk management, providing a scalable solution for automating complex web interactions. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle. These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1) RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802 single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an 8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the art in e-commerce risk management.

The article discusses the reversal curse in language models, where they struggle to infer reverse facts. It argues that this limitation is not inherent but a result of knowledge encoding. Training models on relational knowledge graphs leads to the emergence of bilinear structure in their hidden representations, which helps alleviate the reversal curse. Models with this structure can accurately infer unseen reverse facts and propagate edits consistently. In contrast, models lacking this structure not only face the reversal curse but also struggle to generalize edits, leading to logical inconsistencies. The study highlights the importance of underlying representational geometry in model behavior, emphasizing that successful model editing depends on both editing algorithms and the internal knowledge representation. <div>

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

<div> Keywords: LLMs, agentic reasoning, benchmark, GSM-Agent, tool-augmented method

Summary: 
The study introduces a new benchmark called GSM-Agent to evaluate agentic reasoning in LLM agents by requiring them to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems without the necessary premises. Frontier models like GPT-5 only achieve 67% accuracy on these tasks, highlighting the complexity of agentic reasoning. The concept of an agentic reasoning graph is proposed to analyze the reasoning patterns, revealing a lack of the ability to revisit previously visited nodes in many models. A tool-augmented test-time scaling method is suggested to improve LLMs' agentic reasoning performance by encouraging models to revisit nodes. The benchmark and framework aim to enhance understanding and advancement in the field of agentic reasoning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent, where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems, but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5 only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models. Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic reasoning.

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising, training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model. While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves, providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape. Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces. Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning profiles to meet diverse application demands.

<div> framework, reasoning, parallel, scalable, performance
<br />
A2R is an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework that aims to enhance a model's performance by bridging the gap between its potential and actual capabilities. It consists of an "explorer" model that generates potential solutions in parallel and a "synthesizer" model that refines these solutions through a second stage of reasoning. This framework allows for orthogonal scaling of computation compared to traditional sequential methods. By using A2R, the Qwen3-8B-distill model achieved a 75% performance improvement over its baseline. The framework also introduces A2R-Efficient, a variant that combines a smaller "explorer" model with a larger "synthesizer" model to achieve comparable performance to a much larger model at a significantly lower cost. Overall, A2R is not only a performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly 30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.

Multi-objective search (MOS) is crucial in robotics to balance multiple conflicting objectives.

Abstract: Multi-objective search (MOS) has become essential in robotics, as real-world robotic systems need to simultaneously balance multiple, often conflicting objectives. Recent works explore complex interactions between objectives, leading to problem formulations that do not allow the usage of out-of-the-box state-of-the-art MOS algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a generalized problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation functions of hidden (search) objectives. We show that our formulation supports the application of standard MOS algorithms, necessitating only to properly extend several core operations to reflect the specific aggregation functions employed. We demonstrate our approach in several diverse robotics planning problems, spanning motion-planning for navigation, manipulation and planning fr medical systems under obstacle uncertainty as well as inspection planning, and route planning with different road types. We solve the problems using state-of-the-art MOS algorithms after properly extending their core operations, and provide empirical evidence that they outperform by orders of magnitude the vanilla versions of the algorithms applied to the same problems but without objective aggregation.

Abstract: Although machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) present fascinating opportunities for innovation, their rapid development is also significantly impacting our environment. In response to growing resource-awareness in the field, quantification tools such as the ML Emissions Calculator and CodeCarbon were developed to estimate the energy consumption and carbon emissions of running AI models. They are easy to incorporate into AI projects, however also make pragmatic assumptions and neglect important factors, raising the question of estimation accuracy. This study systematically evaluates the reliability of static and dynamic energy estimation approaches through comparisons with ground-truth measurements across hundreds of AI experiments. Based on the proposed validation framework, investigative insights into AI energy demand and estimation inaccuracies are provided. While generally following the patterns of AI energy consumption, the established estimation approaches are shown to consistently make errors of up to 40%. By providing empirical evidence on energy estimation quality and errors, this study establishes transparency and validates widely used tools for sustainable AI development. It moreover formulates guidelines for improving the state-of-the-art and offers code for extending the validation to other domains and tools, thus making important contributions to resource-aware ML and AI sustainability research.

Summary:
Log2Plan introduces a GUI task automation approach that addresses existing limitations in LLM or VLM-based agents. By combining a structured two-level planning framework with task mining from user behavior logs, Log2Plan achieves robust and adaptable automation. It constructs high-level plans through a structured task dictionary, ensuring generalizability and consistency in automation. The task mining approach from user behavior logs allows for personalization and identification of user-specific patterns, enhancing adaptability and reuse. Real-time grounding of high-level plans into low-level action sequences based on GUI context ensures robust execution across different interfaces. Evaluation on real-world tasks shows significant improvements in task success rate and execution time, with over 60.0% success rate even on long-horizon task sequences, demonstrating Log2Plan's efficacy in complex, multi-step workflows.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GUI task automation streamlines repetitive tasks, but existing LLM or VLM-based planner-executor agents suffer from brittle generalization, high latency, and limited long-horizon coherence. Their reliance on single-shot reasoning or static plans makes them fragile under UI changes or complex tasks. Log2Plan addresses these limitations by combining a structured two-level planning framework with a task mining approach over user behavior logs, enabling robust and adaptable GUI automation. Log2Plan constructs high-level plans by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling consistent and generalizable automation. To support personalization and reuse, it employs a task mining approach from user behavior logs that identifies user-specific patterns. These high-level plans are then grounded into low-level action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust execution across varying interfaces. We evaluated Log2Plan on 200 real-world tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate and execution time. Notably, it maintains over 60.0% success rate even on long-horizon task sequences, highlighting its robustness in complex, multi-step workflows.

<br />Summary: 
This article emphasizes the importance of considering uncertainty in clinical dataset labels, as annotators often disagree and confidence levels vary. Traditional aggregation methods like majority voting can mask this variability. The study shows that accounting for label confidence significantly impacts model rankings in medical imaging benchmarks. It argues for the use of probabilistic metrics that directly assess label distributions, regardless of how the annotations were generated. These metrics are computationally efficient and can be applied to datasets with different annotation processes. The article advocates for the release of raw annotations for datasets and the adoption of uncertainty-aware evaluation in machine-learning assessments to improve the accuracy of performance estimates in clinical settings. <div>
arXiv:2509.22242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better reflect clinical data.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses. Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual question answering and diagnostic tasks.

Modern state-space models often use transition matrices for efficiency but may limit expressivity. A new method, PD-SSM, introduces a structured sparse parametrization enabling optimal state tracking with minimal computational cost. By combining one-hot and complex-valued diagonal matrices, the model can emulate any N-state finite-state automaton with linear scalability. PD-SSM outperforms existing SSM variants on FSA state tracking tasks and matches neural controlled differential equations in multiclass time-series classification. Additionally, PD-SSM integrated into a hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture effectively tracks complex FSAs encoded as variable-length English sentences. The model is theoretically stable and provides state-of-the-art guarantees on expressivity and computational efficiency, showcasing its potential in various time-series analysis tasks.<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity, as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA). While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity, they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of variable-length English sentences.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new method for generating counterfactuals for probabilistic Large Language Models (LLMs). The existing method, while effective in generating specific types of counterfactuals, is critiqued for its ambiguous interpretation of LLMs. The new method presented in the article simplifies the process by representing LLMs as intended, nondeterministic causal models, allowing for broader application across various LLMs without modification. By clarifying the relationship between existing and new methods, the article lays the groundwork for future application-specific approaches to generating counterfactuals in LLMs. This advancement is crucial for explaining, evaluating, and comparing the behavior of LLMs in a more accurate and interpretable manner. <div>
arXiv:2509.22297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by Chatzi et al. and Ravfogel et al. has developed, for the first time, a method for generating counterfactuals of probabilistic Large Language Models. Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\bf x}$ had been ${\bf x}^*$ instead. The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue, however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs: it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals.

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking, Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and \textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation}, \textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and \textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

Summary:<br /><br />Recent work has focused on training Large Language Model (LLM) search agents using reinforcement learning for open-domain question answering. This study introduces SeekBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the epistemic competence of LLM search agents. SeekBench includes 190 expert-annotated response traces with over 1,800 steps generated by LLM search agents, enriched with evidence annotations. The benchmark enables granular analysis of agents' ability to generate reasoning steps grounded in evidence, adaptively reformulate searches to improve results, and correctly assess the sufficiency of evidence for providing answers. SeekBench aims to move beyond traditional evaluations solely based on answer accuracy, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how LLM search agents reason with and utilize external evidence in the question answering process. <div>

Abstract: Recent work has explored training Large Language Model (LLM) search agents with reinforcement learning (RL) for open-domain question answering (QA). However, most evaluations focus solely on final answer accuracy, overlooking how these agents reason with and act on external evidence. We introduce SeekBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the \textit{epistemic competence} of LLM search agents through step-level analysis of their response traces. SeekBench comprises 190 expert-annotated traces with over 1,800 response steps generated by LLM search agents, each enriched with evidence annotations for granular analysis of whether agents (1) generate reasoning steps grounded in observed evidence, (2) adaptively reformulate searches to recover from low-quality results, and (3) have proper calibration to correctly assess whether the current evidence is sufficient for providing an answer.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces the Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation (EMMA) framework, which enhances Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models by integrating a generative data engine for robot manipulation. The framework includes DreamTransfer, a diffusion Transformer-based framework that generates visually consistent and geometrically accurate embodied manipulation videos. These videos allow for text-controlled editing of robot videos, ensuring 3D structure and geometrical plausibility. By using hybrid training with both real and generated data, and implementing the AdaMix training strategy, the EMMA framework enables robots to generalize to unseen object categories and visual domains based on only a single appearance demonstration. In experiments, the generated videos improve policy generalization in real-world robotic manipulation tasks, achieving a significant performance gain of over 200% compared to training on real data alone, and further improving by 13% with AdaMix. <div>

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models increasingly rely on diverse training data to achieve robust generalization. However, collecting large-scale real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation (EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent, geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground, background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a 200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in boosting policy generalization.

Summary:
Automated Search for Artificial Life (ASAL++) introduces a method for open-ended-like search guided by multimodal Foundation Models (FMs) in the field of artificial life. Utilizing a second FM to propose new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history, ASAL++ induces an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets. Two strategies are explored: Evolved Supervised Targets (EST) and Evolved Temporal Targets (ETT). EST promotes greater visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary sequences, tested in the Lenia substrate using Gemma-3. The results of this study suggest that ASAL++ signifies new directions for FM-driven artificial life discovery with open-ended characteristics.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces GeoSketch, a framework for solving geometric problems that involves both text and diagrams. GeoSketch utilizes a Perception module to interpret diagrams, a Symbolic Reasoning module to apply geometric theorems, and a Sketch Action module to make visual changes to the diagram. The model is trained through a two-stage pipeline, combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. The GeoSketch Benchmark, a set of 390 geometry problems, is introduced for evaluation. Results show that GeoSketch improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and problem-solving success compared to static methods, by incorporating dynamic, verifiable interaction in multimodal reasoning.GeoSketch advances the field by integrating hierarchical decision-making, visual actions, and symbolic verification, establishing a new approach for solving complex visuospatial problems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.22460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and (3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in organizing and executing complex tasks, and many such agents are now widely used in various application scenarios. However, developing these agents requires carefully designed workflows, carefully crafted prompts, and iterative tuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These hand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM agents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that can be applied to \textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key innovations: a generalized "agent-as-a-tool" mechanism that automatically decomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit mechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent routing function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent self-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on new tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore, InfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly improving execution efficiency. This framework evolves into a versatile pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that InfiAgent achieves 9.9\% higher performance compared to ADAS (similar auto-generated agent framework), while a case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper shows that it generates scientific papers that have received recognition from human reviewers at top-tier IEEE conferences.

Summary:<br />
This article introduces a new method for evaluating language model (LM) agents based on empowerment, which measures the mutual information between an agent's actions and future states. The proposed algorithm, EELMA, estimates empowerment from multi-turn text interactions. The study validates EELMA through language games and web-browsing scenarios, showing a strong correlation between empowerment and task performance. It also explores the effects of environmental complexity, chain-of-thought, model scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment. High empowerment states and actions are identified as pivotal moments for general capabilities. These findings suggest empowerment as a valuable metric for assessing and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended environments. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities. Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments, including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers, and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with explicit, evidence-linked reasoning.

Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a challenge in interpretability research due to their complex reasoning mechanisms. A new framework called REMA is introduced, which analyzes reasoning failures through a geometric perspective. The concept of the Reasoning Manifold is defined as a low-dimensional structure representing the effective thinking paths of correctly reasoned generations. REMA quantitatively compares internal model representations of erroneous and correct reasoning, identifying geometric deviations and divergence points where reasoning fails. Experiments on various language and multimodal models validate the effectiveness of REMA in analyzing the origins of reasoning failures. This approach connects abstract reasoning failures to measurable geometric discrepancies in representations, offering insights into the internal computational processes of black-box models.<br /><br />Summary: Large Language Models present challenges in interpretability research due to their complex reasoning mechanisms.

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations, thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of black-box models.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, social simulation, altruism, egoism, agent reasoning <br />
<br />
Summary: This study explores the behavior of over 200 Large Language Models (LLMs) in a social simulation focusing on altruism and egoism. The research introduces a Schelling-variant urban migration model to create a social dilemma for the agents. Two distinct archetypes of LLM behavior are identified: "Adaptive Egoists" prioritize self-interest but show increased altruistic behaviors in response to social norms, while "Altruistic Optimizers" consistently prioritize collective benefit. A qualitative analysis of agent reasoning using Grounded Theory reveals the cognitive processes behind these decisions. The findings suggest intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic tendencies of different LLMs, presenting implications for social simulation model selection. "Adaptive Egoists" may be more suitable for simulating complex human societies, while "Altruistic Optimizers" are better suited for scenarios emphasizing collective welfare. <div>
arXiv:2509.22537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulation is a frontier in computational social science. Understanding the social logics these agents embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma, compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and "Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic, consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.

Summary:<br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in solving Operations Research (OR) problems. However, existing approaches face limitations with outcome reward and myopic process evaluation. To address these issues, StepORLM introduces a self-evolving framework with generative process supervision. This framework includes a co-evolutionary loop between a policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM). The dual-feedback mechanism incorporates outcome-based verification and holistic process evaluation to improve the policy model and refine the GenPRM using Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO). The 8B-parameter StepORLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks, surpassing larger models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Additionally, the co-evolved GenPRM serves as a potent process verifier, enhancing inference scaling for both StepORLM and other LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning. Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive, outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover, the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of both our own model and other existing LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression, lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for next-generation multimodal interactive communication.

<br />
Dynamic Experts Search (DES) is a novel approach to Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages the variability in the activation of experts in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs). By allowing for direct control over the number of activated experts during inference, DES generates diverse reasoning trajectories without incurring additional costs. The approach also ensures stability and diversity by maintaining consistent expert counts within a reasoning path while varying them across runs. Through extensive experiments across various MoE architectures and reasoning benchmarks, including math, code, and knowledge tasks, DES consistently outperforms traditional TTS methods, enhancing both accuracy and stability. These results demonstrate that architecture-aware TTS, such as DES, can effectively improve the reasoning abilities of modern LLMs by utilizing structural flexibility. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However, existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search (DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

<title>Benefits and Pitfalls of Reinforcement Learning for Language Model Planning: A Theoretical Perspective</title>

arXiv:2509.22613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction, focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in practice.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the standard paradigm for answering questions on enterprise data. Traditionally, RAG has centered on text-based semantic search and re-ranking. However, this approach falls short when dealing with questions beyond data summarization or non-text data. This has led to various attempts to supplement RAG to bridge the gap between RAG, the implementation paradigm, and the question answering problem that enterprise users expect it to solve. Given that contemporary RAG is a collection of techniques rather than a defined implementation, discussion of RAG and related question-answering systems benefits from a problem-oriented understanding.
  We propose a new classification framework (L1-L5) to categorize systems based on data modalities and task complexity of the underlying question answering problems: L1 (Surface Knowledge of Unstructured Data) through L4 (Reflective and Reasoned Knowledge) and the aspirational L5 (General Intelligence). We also introduce benchmarks aligned with these levels and evaluate four state-of-the-art platforms: LangChain, Azure AI Search, OpenAI, and Corvic AI. Our experiments highlight the value of multi-space retrieval and dynamic orchestration for enabling L1-L4 capabilities. We empirically validate our findings using diverse datasets indicative of enterprise use cases.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a foundational component of modern AI systems, yet it introduces significant privacy risks by exposing user queries to service providers. To address this, we introduce PIR-RAG, a practical system for privacy-preserving RAG. PIR-RAG employs a novel architecture that uses coarse-grained semantic clustering to prune the search space, combined with a fast, lattice-based Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol. This design allows for the efficient retrieval of entire document clusters, uniquely optimizing for the end-to-end RAG workflow where full document content is required. Our comprehensive evaluation against strong baseline architectures, including graph-based PIR and Tiptoe-style private scoring, demonstrates PIR-RAG's scalability and its superior performance in terms of "RAG-Ready Latency"-the true end-to-end time required to securely fetch content for an LLM. Our work establishes PIR-RAG as a viable and highly efficient solution for privacy in large-scale AI systems.

Abstract: Predicting the spread of wildfires is essential for effective fire management and risk assessment. With the fast advancements of artificial intelligence (AI), various deep learning models have been developed and utilized for wildfire spread prediction. However, there is limited understanding of the advantages and limitations of these models, and it is also unclear how deep learning-based fire spread models can be compared with existing non-AI fire models. In this work, we assess the ability of five typical deep learning models integrated with weather and environmental variables for wildfire spread prediction based on over ten years of wildfire data in the state of Hawaii. We further use the 2023 Maui fires as a case study to compare the best deep learning models with a widely-used fire spread model, FARSITE. The results show that two deep learning models, i.e., ConvLSTM and ConvLSTM with attention, perform the best among the five tested AI models. FARSITE shows higher precision, lower recall, and higher F1-score than the best AI models, while the AI models offer higher flexibility for the input data. By integrating AI models with an explainable AI method, we further identify important weather and environmental factors associated with the 2023 Maui wildfires.

Abstract: Seismic velocity inversion is a key task in geophysical exploration, enabling the reconstruction of subsurface structures from seismic wave data. It is critical for high-resolution seismic imaging and interpretation. Traditional physics-driven methods, such as Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), are computationally demanding, sensitive to initialization, and limited by the bandwidth of seismic data. Recent advances in deep learning have led to data-driven approaches that treat velocity inversion as a dense prediction task. This research benchmarks three advanced encoder-decoder architectures -- U-Net, U-Net++, and DeepLabV3+ -- together with SeismoLabV3+, an optimized variant of DeepLabV3+ with a ResNeXt50 32x4d backbone and task-specific modifications -- for seismic velocity inversion using the ThinkOnward 2025 Speed \& Structure dataset, which consists of five-channel seismic shot gathers paired with high-resolution velocity maps. Experimental results show that SeismoLabV3+ achieves the best performance, with MAPE values of 0.03025 on the internal validation split and 0.031246 on the hidden test set as scored via the official ThinkOnward leaderboard. These findings demonstrate the suitability of deep segmentation networks for seismic velocity inversion and underscore the value of tailored architectural refinements in advancing geophysical AI models.

Abstract: Effective cross-modal retrieval requires robust alignment of heterogeneous data types. Most existing methods focus on bi-modal retrieval tasks and rely on distributional alignment techniques such as Kullback-Leibler divergence, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and correlation alignment. However, these methods often suffer from critical limitations, including numerical instability, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and their inability to capture the full structure of the underlying distributions. In this paper, we introduce the Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence, a hyperparameter-free measure that improves both training stability and retrieval performance. We further propose a novel Generalized CS (GCS) divergence inspired by H\"older's inequality. This extension enables direct alignment of three or more modalities within a unified mathematical framework through a bidirectional circular comparison scheme, eliminating the need for exhaustive pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both bi-modal and tri-modal retrieval tasks. The code of our CS/GCS divergence is publicly available at https://github.com/JiahaoZhang666/CSD.

Abstract: We propose an information-topological framework in which cycle closure is the fundamental mechanism of memory and consciousness. Memory is not a static store but the ability to re-enter latent cycles in neural state space, with invariant cycles serving as carriers of meaning by filtering order-specific noise and preserving what persists across contexts. The dot-cycle dichotomy captures this: transient dots scaffold exploration, while nontrivial cycles encode low-entropy content invariants that stabilize memory. Biologically, polychronous neural groups realize 1-cycles through delay-locked spiking reinforced by STDP, nested within theta-gamma rhythms that enforce boundary cancellation. These micro-cycles compose hierarchically, extending navigation loops into general memory and cognition. The perception-action cycle introduces high-order invariance: closure holds even across sense-act alternations, generalizing ancestral homing behavior. Sheaf-cosheaf duality formalizes this process: sheaves glue perceptual fragments into global sections, cosheaves decompose global plans into actions and closure aligns top-down predictions with bottom-up cycles. Consciousness then arises as the persistence of high-order invariants that integrate (unity) yet differentiate (richness) across contexts. We conclude that cycle is all you need: persistent invariants enable generalization in non-ergodic environments with long-term coherence at minimal energetic cost.

Abstract: We study symbolic surrogate modeling of frozen Transformer embeddings to obtain compact, auditable classifiers with calibrated probabilities. For five benchmarks (SST2G, 20NG, MNIST, CIFAR10, MSC17), embeddings from ModernBERT, DINOv2, and SigLIP are partitioned on the training set into disjoint, information-preserving views via semantic-preserving feature partitioning (SPFP). A cooperative multi-population genetic program (MEGP) then learns additive, closed-form logit programs over these views. Across 30 runs per dataset we report F1, AUC, log-loss, Brier, expected calibration error (ECE), and symbolic complexity; a canonical model is chosen by a one-standard-error rule on validation F1 with a parsimony tie-break. Temperature scaling fitted on validation yields substantial ECE reductions on test. The resulting surrogates achieve strong discrimination (up to F1 around 0.99 on MNIST, CIFAR10, MSC17; around 0.95 on SST2G), while 20NG remains most challenging. We provide reliability diagrams, dimension usage and overlap statistics, contribution-based importances, and global effect profiles (PDP and ALE), demonstrating faithful, cross-modal explanations grounded in explicit programs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are exemplary deep models designed for graph data. Message passing mechanism enables GNNs to effectively capture graph topology and push the performance boundaries across various graph tasks. However, the trend of developing such complex machinery for graph representation learning has become unsustainable on large-scale graphs. The computational and time overhead make it imperative to develop more energy-efficient GNNs to cope with the explosive growth of real-world graphs. Spiking Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), which integrate biologically plausible learning via unique spike-based neurons, have emerged as a promising energy-efficient alternative. Different layers communicate with sparse and binary spikes, which facilitates computation and storage of intermediate graph representations. Despite the proliferation of SGNNs proposed in recent years, there is no systematic benchmark to explore the basic design principles of these brain-inspired networks on the graph data. To bridge this gap, we present SGNNBench to quantify progress in the field of SGNNs. Specifically, SGNNBench conducts an in-depth investigation of SGNNs from multiple perspectives, including effectiveness, energy efficiency, and architectural design. We comprehensively evaluate 9 state-of-the-art SGNNs across 18 datasets. Regarding efficiency, we empirically compare these baselines w.r.t model size, memory usage, and theoretical energy consumption to reveal the often-overlooked energy bottlenecks of SGNNs. Besides, we elaborately investigate the design space of SGNNs to promote the development of a general SGNN paradigm.

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional training data.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training pipelines or downstream control logic.

Abstract: This study presents domain-informed genetic superposition programming (DIGSP), a symbolic regression framework tailored for engineering systems governed by separable physical mechanisms. DIGSP partitions the input space into domain-specific feature subsets and evolves independent genetic programming (GP) populations to model material-specific effects. Early evolution occurs in isolation, while ensemble fitness promotes inter-population cooperation. To enable symbolic superposition, an adaptive hierarchical symbolic abstraction mechanism (AHSAM) is triggered after stagnation across all populations. AHSAM performs analysis of variance- (ANOVA) based filtering to identify statistically significant individuals, compresses them into symbolic constructs, and injects them into all populations through a validation-guided pruning cycle. The DIGSP is benchmarked against a baseline multi-gene genetic programming (BGP) model using a dataset of steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) beams. Across 30 independent trials with 65% training, 10% validation, and 25% testing splits, DIGSP consistently outperformed BGP in training and test root mean squared error (RMSE). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirmed statistical significance (p < 0.01), and DIGSP showed tighter error distributions and fewer outliers. No significant difference was observed in validation RMSE due to limited sample size. These results demonstrate that domain-informed structural decomposition and symbolic abstraction improve convergence and generalization. DIGSP offers a principled and interpretable modeling strategy for systems where symbolic superposition aligns with the underlying physical structure.

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images. However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

<title>A Novel Differential Feature Learning for Effective Hallucination Detection and Classification</title>

Abstract: Large language model hallucination represents a critical challenge where outputs deviate from factual accuracy due to distributional biases in training data. While recent investigations establish that specific hidden layers exhibit differences between hallucinatory and factual content, the precise localization of hallucination signals within layers remains unclear, limiting the development of efficient detection methods. We propose a dual-model architecture integrating a Projected Fusion (PF) block for adaptive inter-layer feature weighting and a Differential Feature Learning (DFL) mechanism that identifies discriminative features by computing differences between parallel encoders learning complementary representations from identical inputs. Through systematic experiments across HaluEval's question answering, dialogue, and summarization datasets, we demonstrate that hallucination signals concentrate in highly sparse feature subsets, achieving significant accuracy improvements on question answering and dialogue tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals a hierarchical "funnel pattern" where shallow layers exhibit high feature diversity while deep layers demonstrate concentrated usage, enabling detection performance to be maintained with minimal degradation using only 1\% of feature dimensions. These findings suggest that hallucination signals are more concentrated than previously assumed, offering a pathway toward computationally efficient detection systems that could reduce inference costs while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%, representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67% and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses large language model (LLM) hallucinations by grounding responses in external knowledge, but its effectiveness is compromised by poor-quality retrieved contexts containing irrelevant or noisy information. While existing approaches attempt to improve performance through context selection based on predefined context quality assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality contexts while preserving critical information.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks. Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover, text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps: firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts, the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) providers boast big numbers for maximum context window sizes. To test the real world use of context windows, we 1) define a concept of maximum effective context window, 2) formulate a testing method of a context window's effectiveness over various sizes and problem types, and 3) create a standardized way to compare model efficacy for increasingly larger context window sizes to find the point of failure. We collected hundreds of thousands of data points across several models and found significant differences between reported Maximum Context Window (MCW) size and Maximum Effective Context Window (MECW) size. Our findings show that the MECW is, not only, drastically different from the MCW but also shifts based on the problem type. A few top of the line models in our test group failed with as little as 100 tokens in context; most had severe degradation in accuracy by 1000 tokens in context. All models fell far short of their Maximum Context Window by as much as 99 percent. Our data reveals the Maximum Effective Context Window shifts based on the type of problem provided, offering clear and actionable insights into how to improve model accuracy and decrease model hallucination rates.

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

<title>MAJORScore: A Novel Metric for Evaluating Multimodal Relevance via Joint Representation</title>

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP). However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation metric for the relevance of multiple modalities (N modalities, N>=3) via multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by 13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

Abstract: As smart tourism evolves, AI-powered chatbots have become indispensable for delivering personalized, real-time assistance to travelers while promoting sustainability and efficiency. However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where adversaries manipulate inputs to elicit unintended behaviors such as leaking sensitive information or generating harmful content. This paper presents a case study on the design and implementation of a secure retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot for Hsinchu smart tourism services. The system integrates RAG with API function calls, multi-layered linguistic analysis, and guardrails against injections, achieving high contextual awareness and security. Key features include a tiered response strategy, RAG-driven knowledge grounding, and intent decomposition across lexical, semantic, and pragmatic levels. Defense mechanisms include system norms, gatekeepers for intent judgment, and reverse RAG text to prioritize verified data. We also benchmark a GPT-5 variant (released 2025-08-07) to assess inherent robustness. Evaluations with 674 adversarial prompts and 223 benign queries show over 95% accuracy on benign tasks and substantial detection of injection attacks. GPT-5 blocked about 85% of attacks, showing progress yet highlighting the need for layered defenses. Findings emphasize contributions to sustainable tourism, multilingual accessibility, and ethical AI deployment. This work offers a practical framework for deploying secure chatbots in smart tourism and contributes to resilient, trustworthy AI applications.

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

<title>ReGeS: Reciprocal Retrieval-Generation Synergy for Conversational Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Connecting conversation with external domain knowledge is vital for conversational recommender systems (CRS) to correctly understand user preferences. However, existing solutions either require domain-specific engineering, which limits flexibility, or rely solely on large language models, which increases the risk of hallucination. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) holds promise, its naive use in CRS is hindered by noisy dialogues that weaken retrieval and by overlooked nuances among similar items. We propose ReGeS, a reciprocal Retrieval-Generation Synergy framework that unifies generation-augmented retrieval to distill informative user intent from conversations and retrieval-augmented generation to differentiate subtle item features. This synergy obviates the need for extra annotations, reduces hallucinations, and simplifies continuous updates. Experiments on multiple CRS benchmarks show that ReGeS achieves state-of-the-art performance in recommendation accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of reciprocal synergy for knowledge-intensive CRS tasks.

<title>Automated Prompt Generation for Creative and Counterfactual Text-to-image Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge. Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts, and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis. Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g. confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution (SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal (non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative & economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously (termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy, even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

<title>SAEmnesia: Erasing Concepts in Diffusion Models with Sparse Autoencoders</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21379</link>

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity (i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network, individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning. We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization. Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object removal.

Abstract: In affective neuroscience and emotion-aware AI, understanding how complex auditory stimuli drive emotion arousal dynamics remains unresolved. This study introduces a computational framework to model the brain's encoding of naturalistic auditory inputs into dynamic behavioral/neural responses across three datasets (SEED, LIRIS, self-collected BAVE). Guided by neurobiological principles of parallel auditory hierarchy, we decompose audio into multilevel auditory features (through classical algorithms and wav2vec 2.0/Hubert) from the original and isolated human voice/background soundtrack elements, mapping them to emotion-related responses via cross-dataset analyses. Our analysis reveals that high-level semantic representations (derived from the final layer of wav2vec 2.0/Hubert) exert a dominant role in emotion encoding, outperforming low-level acoustic features with significantly stronger mappings to behavioral annotations and dynamic neural synchrony across most brain regions ($p < 0.05$). Notably, middle layers of wav2vec 2.0/hubert (balancing acoustic-semantic information) surpass the final layers in emotion induction across datasets. Moreover, human voices and soundtracks show dataset-dependent emotion-evoking biases aligned with stimulus energy distribution (e.g., LIRIS favors soundtracks due to higher background energy), with neural analyses indicating voices dominate prefrontal/temporal activity while soundtracks excel in limbic regions. By integrating affective computing and neuroscience, this work uncovers hierarchical mechanisms of auditory-emotion encoding, providing a foundation for adaptive emotion-aware systems and cross-disciplinary explorations of audio-affective interactions.

<title>Do Sparse Subnetworks Exhibit Cognitively Aligned Attention? Effects of Pruning on Saliency Map Fidelity, Sparsity, and Concept Coherence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG) across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns, excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

Abstract: This survey explores the integration of Federated Learning (FL) with Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), with particular emphasis on deep learning and quantum machine learning approaches. FL enables collaborative model training across distributed devices while preserving data privacy-a critical requirement in network security contexts where sensitive traffic data cannot be centralized. Our comprehensive analysis systematically examines the full spectrum of FL architectures, deployment strategies, communication protocols, and aggregation methods specifically tailored for intrusion detection. We provide an in-depth investigation of privacy-preserving techniques, model compression approaches, and attack-specific federated solutions for threats including DDoS, MITM, and botnet attacks. The survey further delivers a pioneering exploration of Quantum FL (QFL), discussing quantum feature encoding, quantum machine learning algorithms, and quantum-specific aggregation methods that promise exponential speedups for complex pattern recognition in network traffic. Through rigorous comparative analysis of classical and quantum approaches, identification of research gaps, and evaluation of real-world deployments, we outline a concrete roadmap for industrial adoption and future research directions. This work serves as an authoritative reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance privacy, efficiency, and robustness of federated intrusion detection systems in increasingly complex network environments, while preparing for the quantum-enhanced cybersecurity landscape of tomorrow.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of applications. However, they often suffer from hallucinations in knowledge-intensive domains due to their reliance on static pretraining corpora. To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources during inference. Among these sources, textual graphs provide structured and semantically rich information that supports more precise and interpretable reasoning. This has led to growing interest in graph-based RAG systems. Despite their potential, most existing approaches rely on a single retriever to identify relevant subgraphs, which limits their ability to capture the diverse aspects of complex queries. Moreover, these systems often struggle to accurately judge the relevance of retrieved content, making them prone to distraction by irrelevant noise. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose MIXRAG, a Mixture-of-Experts Graph-RAG framework that introduces multiple specialized graph retrievers and a dynamic routing controller to better handle diverse query intents. Each retriever is trained to focus on a specific aspect of graph semantics, such as entities, relations, or subgraph topology. A Mixture-of-Experts module adaptively selects and fuses relevant retrievers based on the input query. To reduce noise in the retrieved information, we introduce a query-aware GraphEncoder that carefully analyzes relationships within the retrieved subgraphs, highlighting the most relevant parts while down-weighting unnecessary noise. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms various baselines. MIXRAG is effective across a wide range of graph-based tasks in different domains. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions, which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

Abstract: We study the problem of causal structure learning from a combination of observational and interventional data generated by a linear non-Gaussian structural equation model that might contain cycles. Recent results show that using mere observational data identifies the causal graph only up to a permutation-equivalence class. We obtain a combinatorial characterization of this class by showing that each graph in an equivalence class corresponds to a perfect matching in a bipartite graph. This bipartite representation allows us to analyze how interventions modify or constrain the matchings. Specifically, we show that each atomic intervention reveals one edge of the true matching and eliminates all incompatible causal graphs. Consequently, we formalize the optimal experiment design task as an adaptive stochastic optimization problem over the set of equivalence classes with a natural reward function that quantifies how many graphs are eliminated from the equivalence class by an intervention. We show that this reward function is adaptive submodular and provide a greedy policy with a provable near-optimal performance guarantee. A key technical challenge is to efficiently estimate the reward function without having to explicitly enumerate all the graphs in the equivalence class. We propose a sampling-based estimator using random matchings and analyze its bias and concentration behavior. Our simulation results show that performing a small number of interventions guided by our stochastic optimization framework recovers the true underlying causal structure.

Abstract: Current molecular generative models primarily focus on improving drug-target binding affinity and specificity, often neglecting the system-level phenotypic effects elicited by compounds. Transcriptional profiles, as molecule-level readouts of drug-induced phenotypic shifts, offer a powerful opportunity to guide molecular design in a phenotype-aware manner. We present PhenoMoler, a phenotype-guided molecular generation framework that integrates a chemistry large language model with expression profiles to enable biologically informed drug design. By conditioning the generation on drug-induced differential expression signatures, PhenoMoler explicitly links transcriptional responses to chemical structure. By selectively masking and reconstructing specific substructures-scaffolds, side chains, or linkers-PhenoMoler supports fine-grained, controllable molecular optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhenoMoler generates chemically valid, novel, and diverse molecules aligned with desired phenotypic profiles. Compared to FDA-approved drugs, the generated compounds exhibit comparable or enhanced drug-likeness (QED), optimized physicochemical properties, and superior binding affinity to key cancer targets. These findings highlight PhenoMoler's potential for phenotype-guided and structure-controllable molecular optimization.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns. Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual and multicultural environments where moral reasoning is essential for generating ethically appropriate responses. Yet, the dominant pretraining of LLMs on English-language data raises critical concerns about their ability to generalize judgments across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. In this work, we systematically investigate how language mediates moral decision-making in LLMs. We translate two established moral reasoning benchmarks into five culturally and typologically diverse languages, enabling multilingual zero-shot evaluation. Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in LLMs' moral judgments across languages, often reflecting cultural misalignment. Through a combination of carefully constructed research questions, we uncover the underlying drivers of these disparities, ranging from disagreements to reasoning strategies employed by LLMs. Finally, through a case study, we link the role of pretraining data in shaping an LLM's moral compass. Through this work, we distill our insights into a structured typology of moral reasoning errors that calls for more culturally-aware AI.

Abstract: We propose ARTI-6, a compact six-dimensional articulatory speech encoding framework derived from real-time MRI data that captures crucial vocal tract regions including the velum, tongue root, and larynx. ARTI-6 consists of three components: (1) a six-dimensional articulatory feature set representing key regions of the vocal tract; (2) an articulatory inversion model, which predicts articulatory features from speech acoustics leveraging speech foundation models, achieving a prediction correlation of 0.87; and (3) an articulatory synthesis model, which reconstructs intelligible speech directly from articulatory features, showing that even a low-dimensional representation can generate natural-sounding speech. Together, ARTI-6 provides an interpretable, computationally efficient, and physiologically grounded framework for advancing articulatory inversion, synthesis, and broader speech technology applications. The source code and speech samples are publicly available.

Abstract: Developing custom reasoning models via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can incorporate organization-specific knowledge has great potential to address problems faced by enterprise customers. In many of these problems, the reward function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science, and coding.

Abstract: We present GMLv2, a reference-based model designed for the prediction of subjective audio quality as measured by MUSHRA scores. GMLv2 introduces a Beta distribution-based loss to model the listener ratings and incorporates additional neural audio coding (NAC) subjective datasets to extend its generalization and applicability. Extensive evaluations on diverse testset demonstrate that proposed GMLv2 consistently outperforms widely used metrics, such as PEAQ and ViSQOL, both in terms of correlation with subjective scores and in reliably predicting these scores across diverse content types and codec configurations. Consequently, GMLv2 offers a scalable and automated framework for perceptual audio quality evaluation, poised to accelerate research and development in modern audio coding technologies.

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance, background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding 10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance, with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\% male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted activities were frequently observed across all three models. Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans, offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

<title>Score-based Idempotent Distillation of Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new line of generative models based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. IGNs support both single-and multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores, called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs. We validate our models on multiple image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for idempotent models on the CIFAR and CelebA datasets.

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and text-to-image support our theory.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens. While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought. Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements (5--35 \% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.

<title>Neural Operators for Mathematical Modeling of Transient Fluid Flow in Subsurface Reservoir Systems</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture (TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator, tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex reservoir systems.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting often improves classification accuracy, but it introduces a significant throughput penalty with rationale generation (Wei et al., 2022; Cheng and Van Durme, 2024). To resolve this trade-off, we introduce Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD), a simple training method for decoder-only language models (LMs) that adds (i) a pooled classification head used during training and inference and (ii) a reasoning head supervised by teacher rationales used only in training. We train with a loss function that is a weighted sum of label cross-entropy and token-level LM loss over input-plus-rationale sequences. On seven SuperGLUE tasks, DHRD yields relative gains of 0.65-5.47% over pooled baselines, with notably larger gains on entailment/causal tasks. Since we disable the reasoning head at test time, inference throughput matches pooled classifiers and exceeds CoT decoding on the same backbones by 96-142 times in QPS.

<title>Chasing the Tail: Effective Rubric-based Reward Modeling for Large Language Model Post-Training</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \emph{reward over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones. This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this, we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training improvements. Our code can be accessed at https://github.com/Jun-Kai-Zhang/rubrics.git .

<title>New Algorithmic Directions in Optimal Transport and Applications for Product Spaces</title>

arXiv:2509.21502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study optimal transport between two high-dimensional distributions $\mu,\nu$ in $R^n$ from an algorithmic perspective: given $x \sim \mu$, find a close $y \sim \nu$ in $poly(n)$ time, where $n$ is the dimension of $x,y$. Thus, running time depends on the dimension rather than the full representation size of $\mu,\nu$. Our main result is a general algorithm for transporting any product distribution $\mu$ to any $\nu$ with cost $\Delta + \delta$ under $\ell_p^p$, where $\Delta$ is the Knothe-Rosenblatt transport cost and $\delta$ is a computational error decreasing with runtime. This requires $\nu$ to be "sequentially samplable" with bounded average sampling cost, a new but natural notion.
  We further prove:
  An algorithmic version of Talagrand's inequality for transporting the standard Gaussian $\Phi^n$ to arbitrary $\nu$ under squared Euclidean cost. For $\nu = \Phi^n$ conditioned on a set $\mathcal{S}$ of measure $\varepsilon$, we construct the sequential sampler in expected time $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ using membership oracle access to $\mathcal{S}$. This yields an algorithmic transport from $\Phi^n$ to $\Phi^n|\mathcal{S}$ in $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ time and expected squared distance $O(\log 1/\varepsilon)$, optimal for general $\mathcal{S}$ of measure $\varepsilon$.
  As corollary, we obtain the first computational concentration result (Etesami et al. SODA 2020) for Gaussian measure under Euclidean distance with dimension-independent transportation cost, resolving an open question of Etesami et al. Specifically, for any $\mathcal{S}$ of Gaussian measure $\varepsilon$, most $\Phi^n$ samples can be mapped to $\mathcal{S}$ within distance $O(\sqrt{\log 1/\varepsilon})$ in $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ time.

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy. Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed probability flows.

<title>$\mathbf{Li_2}$: A Framework on Dynamics of Feature Emergence and Delayed Generalization</title>

Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been studied extensively, it remains an open question whether there is a mathematical framework to characterize what kind of features emerge, how and in which conditions it happens from training, for complex structured inputs. We propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature learning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$ across layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden representation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only depends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their representation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about target labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we provably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have achieved state-of-the-art performance for perceptual quality in speech enhancement (SE). However, their iterative nature requires numerous Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), posing a challenge for real-time applications. On the contrary, flow matching offers a more efficient alternative by learning a direct vector field, enabling high-quality synthesis in just a few steps using deterministic ordinary differential equation~(ODE) solvers. We thus introduce Shortcut Flow Matching for Speech Enhancement (SFMSE), a novel approach that trains a single, step-invariant model. By conditioning the velocity field on the target time step during a one-stage training process, SFMSE can perform single, few, or multi-step denoising without any architectural changes or fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate that a single-step SFMSE inference achieves a real-time factor (RTF) of 0.013 on a consumer GPU while delivering perceptual quality comparable to a strong diffusion baseline requiring 60 NFEs. This work also provides an empirical analysis of the role of stochasticity in training and inference, bridging the gap between high-quality generative SE and low-latency constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment, BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together, these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.

Abstract: India is an agro-based economy and proper information about agricultural practices is the key to optimal agricultural growth and output. In order to answer the queries of the farmer, we have build an agricultural chatbot based on the dataset from Kisan Call Center. This system is robust enough to answer queries related to weather, market rates, plant protection and government schemes. This system is available 24* 7, can be accessed through any electronic device and the information is delivered with the ease of understanding. The system is based on a sentence embedding model which gives an accuracy of 56%. After eliminating synonyms and incorporating entity extraction, the accuracy jumps to 86%. With such a system, farmers can progress towards easier information about farming related practices and hence a better agricultural output. The job of the Call Center workforce would be made easier and the hard work of various such workers can be redirected to a better goal.

Abstract: Interactive intelligent agents are being integrated across society. Despite achieving human-like capabilities, humans' responses to these agents remain poorly understood, with research fragmented across disciplines. We conducted a first systematic synthesis comparing a range of psychological and behavioural responses in matched human-agent vs. human-human dyadic interactions. A total of 162 eligible studies (146 contributed to the meta-analysis; 468 effect sizes) were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, which integrated frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Our results indicate that individuals exhibited less prosocial behaviour and moral engagement when interacting with agents vs. humans. They attributed less agency and responsibility to agents, perceiving them as less competent, likeable, and socially present. In contrast, individuals' social alignment (i.e., alignment or adaptation of internal states and behaviours with partners), trust in partners, personal agency, task performance, and interaction experiences were generally comparable when interacting with agents vs. humans. We observed high effect-size heterogeneity for many subjective responses (i.e., social perceptions of partners, subjective trust, and interaction experiences), suggesting context-dependency of partner effects. By examining the characteristics of studies, participants, partners, interaction scenarios, and response measures, we also identified several moderators shaping partner effects. Overall, functional behaviours and interactive experiences with agents can resemble those with humans, whereas fundamental social attributions and moral/prosocial concerns lag in human-agent interactions. Agents are thus afforded instrumental value on par with humans but lack comparable intrinsic value, providing practical implications for agent design and regulation.

Abstract: This study examines domain effects in speaker diarization for African-accented English. We evaluate multiple production and open systems on general and clinical dialogues under a strict DER protocol that scores overlap. A consistent domain penalty appears for clinical speech and remains significant across models. Error analysis attributes much of this penalty to false alarms and missed detections, aligning with short turns and frequent overlap. We test lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning a segmentation module on accent-matched data; it reduces error but does not eliminate the gap. Our contributions include a controlled benchmark across domains, a concise approach to error decomposition and conversation-level profiling, and an adaptation recipe that is easy to reproduce. Results point to overlap-aware segmentation and balanced clinical resources as practical next steps.

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing. Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment, while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs, achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly at finer granularity.

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e., predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

We evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs 0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories. These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and reliability constraints.

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) presents significant challenges and opportunities for optimizing multiple objectives in Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce a MORL taxonomy and examine the advantages and limitations of various MORL methods when applied to LLM optimization, identifying the need for efficient and flexible approaches that accommodate personalization functionality and inherent complexities in LLMs and RL. We propose a vision for a MORL benchmarking framework that addresses the effects of different methods on diverse objective relationships. As future research directions, we focus on meta-policy MORL development that can improve efficiency and flexibility through its bi-level learning paradigm, highlighting key research questions and potential solutions for improving LLM performance.

<title>LANCE: Low Rank Activation Compression for Efficient On-Device Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE reduces activation storage up to 250$\times$ while maintaining accuracy comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets, Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost. These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.

<title>OjaKV: Context-Aware Online Low-Rank KV Cache Compression with Oja's Rule</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21623</link>

Abstract: The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of 4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations, we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular, OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Audio editing plays a central role in VR/AR immersion, virtual conferencing, sound design, and other interactive media. However, recent generative audio editing models depend on template-like instruction formats and are restricted to mono-channel audio. These models fail to deal with declarative audio editing, where the user declares what the desired outcome should be, while leaving the details of editing operations to the system. We introduce SmartDJ, a novel framework for stereo audio editing that combines the reasoning capability of audio language models with the generative power of latent diffusion. Given a high-level instruction, SmartDJ decomposes it into a sequence of atomic edit operations, such as adding, removing, or spatially relocating events. These operations are then executed by a diffusion model trained to manipulate stereo audio. To support this, we design a data synthesis pipeline that produces paired examples of high-level instructions, atomic edit operations, and audios before and after each edit operation. Experiments demonstrate that SmartDJ achieves superior perceptual quality, spatial realism, and semantic alignment compared to prior audio editing methods. Demos are available at https://zitonglan.github.io/project/smartdj/smartdj.html.

<title>A Data-driven Typology of Vision Models from Integrated Representational Metrics</title>

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define representational structure beyond surface design categories.

Abstract: Program verification relies on loop invariants, yet automatically discovering strong invariants remains a long-standing challenge. We introduce a principled framework for evaluating LLMs on invariant synthesis. Our approach uses a verifier-based decision procedure with a formal soundness guarantee and assesses not only correctness but also the speedup that invariants provide in verification. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, and existing LLM-based verifiers against the traditional solver UAutomizer. While LLM-based verifiers represent a promising direction, they do not yet offer a significant advantage over UAutomizer. Model capability also proves critical, as shown by sharp differences in speedups across models, and our benchmark remains an open challenge for current LLMs. Finally, we show that supervised fine-tuning and Best-of-N sampling can improve performance: fine-tuning on 3589 instances raises the percentage of speedup cases for Qwen3-Coder-480B from 8% to 29.2%, and Best-of-N sampling with N=16 improves Claude-sonnet-4 from 8.8% to 22.1%.

<title>MobiLLM: An Agentic AI Framework for Closed-Loop Threat Mitigation in 6G Open RANs</title>

arXiv:2509.21634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks is being accelerated by the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) paradigm -- an open, interoperable architecture that enables intelligent, modular applications across public telecom and private enterprise domains. While this openness creates unprecedented opportunities for innovation, it also expands the attack surface, demanding resilient, low-cost, and autonomous security solutions. Legacy defenses remain largely reactive, labor-intensive, and inadequate for the scale and complexity of next-generation systems. Current O-RAN applications focus mainly on network optimization or passive threat detection, with limited capability for closed-loop, automated response.
  To address this critical gap, we present an agentic AI framework for fully automated, end-to-end threat mitigation in 6G O-RAN environments. MobiLLM orchestrates security workflows through a modular multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework features a Threat Analysis Agent for real-time data triage, a Threat Classification Agent that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to map anomalies to specific countermeasures, and a Threat Response Agent that safely operationalizes mitigation actions via O-RAN control interfaces. Grounded in trusted knowledge bases such as the MITRE FiGHT framework and 3GPP specifications, and equipped with robust safety guardrails, MobiLLM provides a blueprint for trustworthy AI-driven network security. Initial evaluations demonstrate that MobiLLM can effectively identify and orchestrate complex mitigation strategies, significantly reducing response latency and showcasing the feasibility of autonomous security operations in 6G.

<title>Limitations on Safe, Trusted, Artificial General Intelligence</title>

arXiv:2509.21654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety, trust and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are aspirational goals in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and there are several informal interpretations of these notions. In this paper, we propose strict, mathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification, planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to G\"odel's incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of G\"odel's and Turing's results.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic integration (NeSy) blends neural-network learning with symbolic reasoning. The field can be split between methods injecting hand-crafted rules into neural models, and methods inducing symbolic rules from data. We introduce Logic of Hypotheses (LoH), a novel language that unifies these strands, enabling the flexible integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic priors and expert knowledge. LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a pool of options. Using fuzzy logic, formulas in LoH can be directly compiled into a differentiable computational graph, so the optimal choices can be learned via backpropagation. This framework subsumes some existing NeSy models, while adding the possibility of arbitrary degrees of knowledge specification. Moreover, the use of Goedel fuzzy logic and the recently developed Goedel trick yields models that can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without any loss in performance. We provide experimental analysis on such models, showing strong results on tabular data and on the Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task, while producing interpretable decision rules.

Abstract: While deep learning models excel at predictive tasks, they often overfit due to their complex structure and large number of parameters, causing them to memorize training data, including noise, rather than learn patterns that generalize to new data. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically, our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference, measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior and mitigate overfitting

arXiv:2509.21670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are used for a wide range of applications, such as gesture recognition, gait analysis, and sports monitoring. Yet most existing foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong generalization for sensing foundation models.

Abstract: We introduce QueryGym, an interactive environment for building, testing, and evaluating LLM-based query planning agents. Existing frameworks often tie agents to specific query language dialects or obscure their reasoning; QueryGym instead requires agents to construct explicit sequences of relational algebra operations, ensuring engine-agnostic evaluation and transparent step-by-step planning. The environment is implemented as a Gymnasium interface that supplies observations -- including schema details, intermediate results, and execution feedback -- and receives actions that represent database exploration (e.g., previewing tables, sampling column values, retrieving unique values) as well as relational algebra operations (e.g., filter, project, join). We detail the motivation and the design of the environment. In the demo, we showcase the utility of the environment by contrasting it with contemporary LLMs that query databases. QueryGym serves as a practical testbed for research in error remediation, transparency, and reinforcement learning for query generation. For the associated demo, see https://ibm.biz/QueryGym.

<title>Optimizing the non-Clifford-count in unitary synthesis using Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: An efficient implementation of unitary operators is important in order to practically realize the computational advantages claimed by quantum algorithms over their classical counterparts. In this paper we study the potential of using reinforcement learning (RL) in order to synthesize quantum circuits, while optimizing the T-count and CS-count, of unitaries that are exactly implementable by the Clifford+T and Clifford+CS gate sets, respectively. In general, the complexity of existing algorithms depend exponentially on the number of qubits and the non-Clifford-count of unitaries. We have designed our RL framework to work with channel representation of unitaries, that enables us to perform matrix operations efficiently, using integers only. We have also incorporated pruning heuristics and a canonicalization of operators, in order to reduce the search complexity. As a result, compared to previous works, we are able to implement significantly larger unitaries, in less time, with much better success rate and improvement factor. Our results for Clifford+T synthesis on two qubits achieve close-to-optimal decompositions for up to 100 T gates, 5 times more than previous RL algorithms and to the best of our knowledge, the largest instances achieved with any method to date. Our RL algorithm is able to recover previously-known optimal linear complexity algorithm for T-count-optimal decomposition of 1 qubit unitaries. For 2-qubit Clifford+CS unitaries, our algorithm achieves a linear complexity, something that could only be accomplished by a previous algorithm using $SO(6)$ representation.

Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human privacy preferences requires understanding individuals' nuanced disclosure behaviors beyond general norms. Yet eliciting such boundaries remains challenging due to the context-dependent nature of privacy decisions and the complex trade-offs involved. We present an AI-powered elicitation approach that probes individuals' privacy boundaries through a discriminative task. We conducted a between-subjects study that systematically varied communication roles and delegation conditions, resulting in 1,681 boundary specifications from 169 participants for 61 scenarios. We examined how these contextual factors and individual differences influence the boundary specification. Quantitative results show that communication roles influence individuals' acceptance of detailed and identifiable disclosure, AI delegation and individuals' need for privacy heighten sensitivity to disclosed identifiers, and AI delegation results in less consensus across individuals. Our findings highlight the importance of situating privacy preference elicitation within real-world data flows. We advocate using nuanced privacy boundaries as an alignment goal for future AI systems.

Abstract: Many institutions are currently grappling with teaching artificial intelligence (AI) in the face of growing demand and relevance in our world. The Computing Research Association (CRA) has conducted 32 moderated virtual roundtable discussions of 202 experts committed to improving AI education. These discussions slot into four focus areas: AI Knowledge Areas and Pedagogy, Infrastructure Challenges in AI Education, Strategies to Increase Capacity in AI Education, and AI Education for All. Roundtables were organized around institution type to consider the particular goals and resources of different AI education environments. We identified the following high-level community needs to increase capacity in AI education. A significant digital divide creates major infrastructure hurdles, especially for smaller and under-resourced institutions. These challenges manifest as a shortage of faculty with AI expertise, who also face limited time for reskilling; a lack of computational infrastructure for students and faculty to develop and test AI models; and insufficient institutional technical support. Compounding these issues is the large burden associated with updating curricula and creating new programs. To address the faculty gap, accessible and continuous professional development is crucial for faculty to learn about AI and its ethical dimensions. This support is particularly needed for under-resourced institutions and must extend to faculty both within and outside of computing programs to ensure all students have access to AI education. We have compiled and organized a list of resources that our participant experts mentioned throughout this study. These resources contribute to a frequent request heard during the roundtables: a central repository of AI education resources for institutions to freely use across higher education.

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout. This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states, highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and enhance AI agent training.

Abstract: Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.

Abstract: Lead optimization in drug discovery requires efficiently navigating vast chemical space through iterative cycles to enhance molecular properties while preserving structural similarity to the original lead compound. Despite recent advances, traditional optimization methods struggle with sample efficiency-achieving good optimization performance with limited oracle evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach through their in-context learning and instruction following capabilities, which align naturally with these iterative processes. However, existing LLM-based methods fail to leverage this strength, treating each optimization step independently. To address this, we present POLO (Preference-guided multi-turn Optimization for Lead Optimization), which enables LLMs to learn from complete optimization trajectories rather than isolated steps. At its core, POLO introduces Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that extracts learning signals at two complementary levels: trajectory-level optimization reinforces successful strategies, while turn-level preference learning provides dense comparative feedback by ranking intermediate molecules within each trajectory. Through this dual-level learning from intermediate evaluation, POLO achieves superior sample efficiency by fully exploiting each costly oracle call. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLO achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (2.3x better than baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks using only 500 oracle evaluations, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient molecular optimization.
